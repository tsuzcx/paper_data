Conventionally, computing is thought to be manipulation of numbers or symbols. However, human recognition capabilities are based on ability to process nonnumeric clumps of information (information granules) in addition to individual numeric values. This paper proposes a granular neural network (GNN) called granular reflex fuzzy min-max neural network (GrRFMN) which can learn and classify granular data. GrRFMN uses hyperbox fuzzy set to represent granular data. Its architecture consists of a reflex mechanism inspired from human brain to handle class overlaps. The network can be trained online using granular or point data. The neuron activation functions in GrRFMN are designed to tackle data of different granularity (size). This paper also addresses an issue to granulate the training data and learn from it. It is observed that such a preprocessing of data can improve performance of a classifier. Experimental results on real data sets show that the proposed GrRFMN can classify granules of different granularity more correctly. Results are compared with general fuzzy min-max neural network (GFMN) proposed by Gabrys and Bargiela and with some classical methods.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2009.2016419","startPage":"1117","endPage":"1134","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5159575/04982624.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2009.2016419","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Granular Reflex Fuzzy Min\u2013Max Neural Network for Classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Neural networks","Humans","Neurons","Fuzzy sets","Pattern recognition","Fuzzy logic","Training data","Clouds","Fuzzy set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy set theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["granular reflex fuzzy min-max neural network","data classification","data clustering","pattern recognition","human recognition capabilities","nonnumeric clumps","hyperbox fuzzy set","human brain","neuron activation functions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compensatory neurons","granular data classification","granular neural network (GNN)","reflex mechanism"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Artificial Intelligence","Brain","Computer Simulation","Data Interpretation, Statistical","Fuzzy Logic","Humans","Mathematical Computing","Neural Networks (Computer)","Neurons","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reflex","Software","Statistics as Topic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4982624/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Granular Reflex Fuzzy Min\u2013Max Neural Network for Classification","volume":"20","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4982624/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10774880","pubMedId":"19482576","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Granular Reflex Fuzzy Min\u2013Max Neural Network for Classification","sourcePdf":"tnn-anandedkar-2016419.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127496S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5159575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5159575","articleId":"4982624","onlineDate":"27 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4982625,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander A.

It is shown that this extended algorithm supports even the more complex model of signals that are supposed to be related to textual documents. It is hypothesized that every topic in textual data is characterized by a set of words which coherently appear in documents dedicated to a given topic. The appearance of each word in a document is coded by the activity of a particular neuron. In accordance with the Hebbian learning rule implemented in the network, sets of coherently appearing words (treated as factors) create tightly connected groups of neurons, hence, revealing them as attractors of the network dynamics. The found factors are eliminated from the network memory by the Hebbian unlearning rule facilitating the search of other factors. Topics related to the found sets of words can be identified based on the words' semantics. To make the method complete, a special technique based on a Bayesian procedure has been developed for the following purposes: first, to provide a complete description of factors in terms of component probability, and second, to enhance the accuracy of classification of signals to determine whether it contains the factor. Since it is assumed that every word may possibly contribute to several topics, the proposed method might be related to the method of fuzzy clustering. In this paper, we show that the results of Boolean factor analysis and fuzzy clustering are not contradictory, but complementary. To demonstrate the capabilities of this attempt, the method is applied to two types of textual data on neural networks in two different languages. The obtained topics and corresponding words are at a good level of agreement despite the fact that identical topics in Russian and English conferences contain different sets of keywords.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4982625/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 May 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10774881","pubMedId":"19482577","volume":"20","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4982625/","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Recurrent-Neural-Network-Based Boolean Factor Analysis and Its Application to Word Clustering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recurrent-Neural-Network-Based Boolean Factor Analysis and Its Application to Word Clustering","sourcePdf":"tnn-dhusek-2016090.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.179281S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5159575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5159575","articleId":"4982625","onlineDate":"27 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4982626,"authors":[{"name":"Jang-Hyun Park","affiliation":["Department of Control System Engineering, Mokpo National University, Choongnam, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jang-Hyun","lastName":"Park","id":"37281008200"},{"name":"Seong-Hwan Kim","affiliation":["Department of Control System Engineering, Mokpo National University, Choongnam, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seong-Hwan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37366621600"},{"name":"Chae-Joo Moon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Mokpo National University, Choongnam, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chae-Joo","lastName":"Moon","id":"37416013300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"4982626","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":95,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1025},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Nonlinear systems","Backstepping","Neural networks","Stability analysis","Uncertain systems","Lyapunov method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","control nonlinearities","Lyapunov methods","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","stability","state feedback","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive neural control","single-input-single-output strict-feedback nonlinear system","output-feedback control problem","Lyapunov stability","lumped uncertain system nonlinearity","tracking error filtering","approximation property"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive neural control","strict-feedback nonlinear system"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adaptation, Physiological","Algorithms","Artifacts","Artificial Intelligence","Computer Simulation","Feedback","Neural Networks (Computer)","Nonlinear Dynamics","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Software"]}],"abstract":"In this brief, a new adaptive neurocontrol algorithm for a single-input-single-output (SISO) strict-feedback nonlinear system is proposed. Most of the previous adaptive neural control algorithms for strict-feedback nonlinear systems were based on the backstepping scheme, which makes the control law and stability analysis very complicated. The main contribution of the proposed method is that it demonstrates that the state-feedback control of the strict-feedback system can be viewed as the output-feedback control problem of the system in the normal form. As a result, the proposed control algorithm is considerably simpler than the previous ones based on backstepping. Depending heavily on the universal approximation property of the neural network (NN), only one NN is employed to approximate the lumped uncertain system nonlinearity. The Lyapunov stability of the NN weights and filtered tracking error is guaranteed in the semiglobal sense.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2009.2020982","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5159575/04982626.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2009.2020982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159575","startPage":"1204","endPage":"1209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Neural Control for Strict-Feedback Nonlinear Systems Without Backstepping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4982626","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Neural Control for Strict-Feedback Nonlinear Systems Without Backstepping","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4982626/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 May 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10774885","pubMedId":"19482573","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4982626/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Neural Control for Strict-Feedback Nonlinear Systems Without Backstepping","sourcePdf":"tnn-jpark-2020982.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060133S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5159575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"5159575","articleId":"4982626","onlineDate":"27 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4982629,"authors":[{"name":"Beibei Ren","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5159575/4982629/4982629-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Beibei Ren (S'06) received the B.E. degree in mechanical and electronic engineering and the M.E. degree in automation from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.

This increasing complexity is mainly driven by the need to compute command derivatives at each step of the design, with the ultimate step requiring derivatives of the same order as the plant. This article addresses a modification that obviates the need to compute analytic derivatives by introducing command filters in the backstepping design. While the concept of the command filter has previously been introduced in the literature, the main contribution of this technical note is the rigorous analysis of the effect of the command filter on closed-loop stability and performance, and a proof of stability based on Tikhonov's theorem.

The contribution of this paper is that two fundamental stabilization problems for the inverted 3-D pendulum are posed and solved. The first problem, asymptotic stabilization of a specified equilibrium in the inverted equilibrium manifold, is solved using smooth and globally defined feedback of angular velocity and attitude of the 3-D pendulum. The second problem, asymptotic stabilization of the inverted equilibrium manifold, is solved using smooth and globally defined feedback of angular velocity and a reduced attitude vector of the 3-D pendulum. These control problems for the 3-D pendulum exemplify attitude stabilization problems on the configuration manifold SO(3) in the presence of potential forces. Lyapunov analysis and nonlinear geometric methods are used to assess global closed-loop properties, yielding a characterization of the almost global domain of attraction for each case.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2009.2019792","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/5071740/04982652.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2009.2019792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5071740","startPage":"1204","endPage":"1215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic Smooth Stabilization of the Inverted 3-D Pendulum","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4982652","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic Smooth Stabilization of the Inverted 3-D Pendulum","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4982652/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 May 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10728528","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4982652/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic Smooth Stabilization of the Inverted 3-D Pendulum","sourcePdf":"tac-chaturvedi-2019792.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134458S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"5071740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"5071740","articleId":"4982652","onlineDate":"27 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4982653,"authors":[{"name":"Ping Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Automatic Control and Complex Systems, University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany","Competence Center of Automation Technology, BASF-SE, Ludwigshafen, Germany"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37418071900"},{"name":"Steven X.

The proposed CPM frequency-domain decision feedback equalizer (DFE) eliminates the complexity overhead of conventional decomposition-based CPM receivers.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2024017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5307285","startPage":"4903","endPage":"4908","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5307285/04982655.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2024017","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-Domain Channel Estimation and Equalization for Continuous-Phase Modulations With Superimposed Pilot Sequences","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Decision feedback equalizers","Wireless communication","Covariance matrix","Broadband communication","Throughput","Fading","Discrete Fourier transforms","Partial transmit sequences","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","communication complexity","continuous phase modulation","equalisers","frequency-domain analysis","radio networks","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous-phase modulation block transmissions","frequency-domain channel estimation","frequency-domain channel equalization","superimposed pilot sequences","broadband CPM wireless communications","CPM frequency-domain decision feedback equalizer","decomposition-based CPM receivers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block transmission","continuous-phase modulation (CPM)","frequency-domain channel estimation and equalization","superimposed pilot-assisted transmission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-Domain Channel Estimation and Equalization for Continuous-Phase Modulations With Superimposed Pilot Sequences","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4982655/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4982655/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10966614","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-Domain Channel Estimation and Equalization for Continuous-Phase Modulations With Superimposed Pilot Sequences","sourcePdf":"tvt-park-2024017.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054408S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5307285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5307285","articleId":"4982655","onlineDate":"27 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4982656,"authors":[{"name":"Jaewoo So","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5307285/4982656/4982656-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jaewoo So (S'97\u2013M'03\u2013SM'08) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 1997 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, in 1999 and 2002, respectively.","From 2001 to 2005, he was with IP One, Seoul, where he led several research projects and developed IEEE 802.11a/b/g products and heterogeneous network solutions.

Users compete to report the channel state information (CSI) via contention-based feedback channels if their scheduling metric exceeds a threshold. The users are divided into two classes according to their scheduling metric. For each class, the users have different random access probabilities and different chances to access feedback minislots. The performance of the proposed feedback protocol is evaluated in a MIMO system with zero-forcing (ZF) receivers in terms of the sum-rate capacity, the feedback load, and fairness. The simulation results show that the proposed feedback protocol significantly reduces the feedback load without sacrificing the sum-rate capacity too much.

Direct detection receivers are capable of detecting arbitrary modulation formats with differentially encoded phases such as differentially phase shift keying (DPSK) and star shaped quadrature amplitude modulation (Star QAM) formats. In an earlier publication of the authors (M.

Here, these investigations are extended. A tool for semi-analytical BER estimation is developed allowing to calculate the BER down to small values such as 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-9</sup>\n for a wide range of modulation formats, as well as for different receiver structures. Using this module, the back-to-back OSNR requirements are calculated. CD and SPM tolerances are characterized by optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) penalties at BER = 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-9</sup>\n .

Traditionally, they are learned from a collection of labeled color chips. These color chips are labeled with color names within a well-defined experimental setup by human test subjects. However, naming colors in real-world images differs significantly from this experimental setting. In this paper, we investigate how color names learned from color chips compare to color names learned from real-world images. To avoid hand labeling real-world images with color names, we use Google image to collect a data set. Due to the limitations of Google image, this data set contains a substantial quantity of wrongly labeled data. We propose several variants of the PLSA model to learn color names from this noisy data. Experimental results show that color names learned from real-world images significantly outperform color names learned from labeled color chips for both image retrieval and image annotation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4982667/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10704742","pubMedId":"19482579","htmlLink":"/document/4982667/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"7","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Learning Color Names for Real-World Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Color Names for Real-World Applications","sourcePdf":"18tip07-jvandeweijer-2019809.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069427S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5073253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"415","xplore-issue":"5073253","articleId":"4982667","onlineDate":"27 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4982669,"authors":[{"name":"Hamzeh Beyranvand","affiliation":["Optical Networks Research Laboratory (ONRL) Electrical Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5210716/4982669/4982669-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hamzeh Beyranvand was born in Khorramabad, Iran, on June 27, 1984.

The emphasis is on OCDMA systems employing multi-length variable-weight optical orthogonal codes (MLVW-OOC) as signature sequence. We begin by presenting a two-class variable-weight OCDMA system in which all users have the same energy level in one bit duration. As a consequence, high weight users transmit their corresponding optical pulses at a lower power while low weight users transmit their corresponding optical pulses at a higher power level. We show that using this multilevel signaling technique, while employing the well known optical AND logic gate receiver structure, we achieve a considerable improvement in the performance of low-weight (high-power) users while the performance of high-weight (low-power) users not altered in comparison to one-level system. In the next step, we indicate that by using the recently introduced multistage receiver structure, which employs advanced optical logic gate elements, interferences at different power levels are distinguishable so that the performance of both high-weight and low-weight users are improved. Furthermore, we employ multilevel signaling technique in OCDMA system based on MLVW-OOC (multirate, differentiated QoS system). We show that using multilevel signaling technique in such a system results to the performance improvement. To analyze the performance of the system we obtain a closed-form relation expressing an upper bound on the probability of error of the system. Finally, to validate the upper bound, the analytical results are compared to the results of system simulation. The numerical closeness between the analytical and system simulation reveals the tightness of the obtained upper bound, hence making them quite useful in evaluating the above system's performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multirate, Differentiated-QoS, and Multilevel Fiber-Optic CDMA System via Optical Logic Gate Elements","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2023813","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5210716/04982669.pdf","startPage":"4348","endPage":"4359","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2023813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5210716","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4982669","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4982669/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.1,  2009","displayDocTitle":"Multirate, Differentiated-QoS, and Multilevel Fiber-Optic CDMA System via Optical Logic Gate Elements","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"19","htmlLink":"/document/4982669/","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","publicationDate":"Oct.1, 2009","accessionNumber":"10860119","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multirate, Differentiated-QoS, and Multilevel Fiber-Optic CDMA System via Optical Logic Gate Elements","sourcePdf":"jlt-jsalehi-2023813.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152986S","chronDate":"Oct.1,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5210716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5210716","articleId":"4982669","onlineDate":"27 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4982670,"authors":[{"name":"Jinsung Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5161480/4982670/4982670-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jinsung Choi (S'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea, in 2004 and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at POSTECH.","His main interests are analog/RF circuit design in ultra deep-submicrometer CMOS technology, mixed-mode signal-processing integrated-circuit design, and digitally assisted RF transceiver architectures.","Mr. Choi was the recipient of the 2009 Samsung Electronics Bronze Prize of the Human-Tech Thesis Prize."]},"firstName":"Jinsung","lastName":"Choi","id":"37405962600"},{"name":"Dongsu Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5161480/4982670/4982670-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Dongsu Kim received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea, in 2007, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at POSTECH.","His research interests are CMOS RF circuits for wireless communications, with a special focus on highly efficient and linear RF transmitter design."]},"firstName":"Dongsu","lastName":"Kim","id":"37068059400"},{"name":"Daehyun Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5161480/4982670/4982670-photo-3-source-small.gif","p":["Daehyun Kang (S'08) received the B.S. degree in electronic and electrical engineering from Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea, in 2006, and is currently working toward Ph.D. degree at the Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea.","His research interests include the design of PAs and highly efficient and linear transmitters."]},"firstName":"Daehyun","lastName":"Kang","id":"37289143600"},{"name":"Bumman Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5161480/4982670/4982670-photo-4-source-small.gif","p":["Bumman Kim (M'78\u2013SM'97\u2013F'07) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, in 1979.","From 1978 to 1981, he was engaged in fiber-optic network component research with GTE Laboratories Inc.

Quantitative results on synthetic data show the performances of the proposed method compared to well-established and state-of-the-art methods. Results on real images demonstrate that the proposed method is able to preserve accurately edges and structural details of the image.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2024064","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5234065/04982678.pdf","startPage":"2221","endPage":"2229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2024064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5234065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlocal means-based speckle filtering for ultrasound images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4982678","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4982678/","displayDocTitle":"Nonlocal means-based speckle filtering for ultrasound images","volume":"18","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10864223","pubMedId":"19482578","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4982678/","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlocal means-based speckle filtering for ultrasound images","sourcePdf":"18tip09-phellier-2024064.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124864S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5234065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"381","xplore-issue":"5234065","articleId":"4982678","onlineDate":"27 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":4982682,"authors":[{"name":"Ienkaran Arasaratnam","affiliation":["Cognitive Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/5071740/4982682/4982682-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ienkaran Arasaratnam received the B.Sc. degree (with first class honors) from the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, in 2003 and the M.A.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada, in 2006 and 2009, respectively.","He is currently working as a Research Scientist with the Cognitive Systems Laboratory, McMaster University, and involved in the design and development of the next-generation cognitive radar systems.

The heart of the CKF is a spherical-radial cubature rule, which makes it possible to numerically compute multivariate moment integrals encountered in the nonlinear Bayesian filter. Specifically, we derive a third-degree spherical-radial cubature rule that provides a set of cubature points scaling linearly with the state-vector dimension. The CKF may therefore provide a systematic solution for high-dimensional nonlinear filtering problems. The paper also includes the derivation of a square-root version of the CKF for improved numerical stability. The CKF is tested experimentally in two nonlinear state estimation problems. In the first problem, the proposed cubature rule is used to compute the second-order statistics of a nonlinearly transformed Gaussian random variable. The second problem addresses the use of the CKF for tracking a maneuvering aircraft. The results of both experiments demonstrate the improved performance of the CKF over conventional nonlinear filters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4982682/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","volume":"54","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10728505","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4982682/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cubature Kalman Filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cubature Kalman Filters","sourcePdf":"tac-arasaratna-2019800.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126335S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"5071740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"1629","xplore-issue":"5071740","articleId":"4982682","onlineDate":"27 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":4982683,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolas Mansard","affiliation":["INRIA Rennes Bretagne Atlantique and IRISA, Rennes, France","LAAS CNRS-Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Toulouse, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/5071740/4982683/4982683-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nicolas Mansard graduated from \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure d'Informatique et de Math\u00e9matiques Appliqu\u00e9es, Grenoble, France and received the M.S.

Classically, this is done by using the redundancy formalism. If the main task does not constrain all the motions of the robot, a secondary task can be achieved by using only the remaining degrees of freedom (DOF). We propose a new general method that frees up some of the DOF constrained by the main task in addition of the remaining DOF. The general idea is to enable the motions produced by the secondary control law that help the main task to be completed faster. The main advantage is to enhance the performance of the secondary task by enlarging the number of available DOF. In a formal framework, a projection operator is built which ensures that the secondary control law does not delay the completion of the main task. A control law can then be easily computed from the two tasks considered. Experiments that implement and validate this approach are presented. The visual servoing framework is used to position a six-DOF robot while simultaneously avoiding occlusions and joint limits.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot control","Robot sensing systems","Motion control","Control systems","Visual servoing","Servomechanisms","Kinematics","Navigation","Delay","Sensor systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","motion control","position control","robot vision","robots","visual servoing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directional redundancy","robot control","supplementary constraint","robot motion","degrees-of-freedom","secondary control law","projection operator","visual servoing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gradient projection method","redundancy","robot control","sensor-feedback control","visual servoing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAC.2009.2019790","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/5071740/04982683.pdf","startPage":"1179","endPage":"1192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5071740","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2009.2019790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Directional Redundancy for Robot Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4982683","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Directional Redundancy for Robot Control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4982683/","volume":"54","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4982683/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10728515","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Directional Redundancy for Robot Control","sourcePdf":"tac-mansard-2019790.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083326S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"5071740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5071740","articleId":"4982683","onlineDate":"27 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-08"},{"_id":4982686,"authors":[{"name":"Alim P.

For example, an x-by-wire system, such as electromechanical brake system in which rigid mechanical components are replaced with dynamically configurable electronic elements, should be fault-tolerant because a critical failure could arise without warning. Therefore, in order to guarantee the reliability of safety-critical systems, fault-tolerant functions have been studied in detail. This paper presents a Kalman predictive redundancy system with a fault-detection algorithm using the Kalman filter that can remove the effect of faults. This paper also describes the detailed implementation of such a system using an embedded microcontroller to demonstrate that the Kalman predictive redundancy system outperforms well-known average and median voters. The experimental results show that the Kalman predictive redundancy system can ensure the fault-tolerance of safety-critical systems such as x-by-wire systems.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2009.2020566","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/5406290/04982692.pdf","startPage":"46","endPage":"53","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2009.2020566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5406290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kalman Predictive Redundancy System for Fault Tolerance of Safety-Critical Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4982692","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4982692/","displayDocTitle":"Kalman Predictive Redundancy System for Fault Tolerance of Safety-Critical Systems","volume":"6","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11105293","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4982692/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kalman Predictive Redundancy System for Fault Tolerance of Safety-Critical Systems","sourcePdf":"tii-klee-2020566.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074467S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"5406290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5406290","articleId":"4982692","onlineDate":"27 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4982695,"authors":[{"name":"Maria Sabrina Sarto","affiliation":["Research Center on Nanotechnology Applied to Engineering of Sapienza (CNIS), Electromagnetic Compatibility Laboratory, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/5379144/4982695/4982695-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Maria Sabrina Sarto (M'93\u2013SM'00) received the Laurea degree (cum laude) in electrical engineering in 1992 and the Ph.D. degree in 1997, both from the Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.","From 1998 to 2004, she was an Associate Professor of electrotechnics at the Faculty of Engineering, Sapienza University of Rome, where she has been a Full Professor since 2005 and has been a Scientific Responsible of the Electromagnetic Compatibility Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering since 1998.

In addition, we also use the search enable technique to eliminate the unnecessary search-line switching activity in the quiet pattern. By reducing both the search-line switching activity and average switching power, the proposed design can minimize the TCAM search-line power consumption.

It is found that the CF is destroyed during unipolar switching but can be reused during bipolar switching.","doi":"10.1109/LED.2009.2021001","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/55/5109799/04982706.pdf","startPage":"733","endPage":"735","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2009.2021001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5109799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RESET Mechanism of TiOx Resistance-Change Memory Device","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"RESET Mechanism of TiOx Resistance-Change Memory Device","volume":"30","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10731580","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4982706/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4982706/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RESET Mechanism of TiOx Resistance-Change Memory Device","sourcePdf":"led-wang-2021001.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048149S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"5109799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5109799","articleId":"4982706","onlineDate":"27 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4982708,"authors":[{"name":"Heng Yuan Lee","affiliation":["Optoelectronics Research Laboratory, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan","Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Heng Yuan","lastName":"Lee","id":"37292582400"},{"name":"Pang-Shiu Chen","affiliation":["Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Minghsin University of Science and Technology, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pang-Shiu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37423471200"},{"name":"Tai-Yuan Wu","affiliation":["Electronics and Optoelectronics Research Laboratory, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tai-Yuan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37576056700"},{"name":"Yu Sheng Chen","affiliation":["Electronics and Optoelectronics Research Laboratory, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu Sheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293327000"},{"name":"Fred Chen","affiliation":["Electronics and Optoelectronics Research Laboratory, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Fred","lastName":"Chen","id":"37404545500"},{"name":"Ching-Chiun Wang","affiliation":["Electronics and Optoelectronics Research Laboratory, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Chiun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599183500"},{"name":"Pei-Jer Tzeng","affiliation":["Electronics and Optoelectronics Research Laboratory, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pei-Jer","lastName":"Tzeng","id":"37264976100"},{"name":"C.

The fuzzy controller is based on an interval type-2 fuzzy system (IT2FS). The antecedent part in the designed IT2FS uses interval type-2 fuzzy sets to improve controller robustness to noise. There are initially no fuzzy rules in the IT2FS. The ORGQACO concurrently designs both the structure and parameters of an IT2FS. We propose an online interval type-2 rule generation method for the evolution of system structure and flexible partitioning of the input space. Consequent part parameters in an IT2FS are designed using Q-values and the reinforcement local-global ant colony optimization algorithm. This algorithm selects the consequent part from a set of candidate actions according to ant pheromone trails and Q-values, both of which are updated using reinforcement signals. The ORGQACO design method is applied to the following three control problems: (1) truck-backing control; (2) magnetic-levitation control; and (3) chaotic-system control. The ORGQACO is compared with other reinforcement-learning methods to verify its efficiency and effectiveness.

We consider both the channel gain feedback (CGF) system and the channel covariance feedback (CCF) system. Using an accurate capacity lower bound as a figure of merit that takes channel estimation errors into account, we investigate the optimization problems on the temporal power allocation to training and data transmission as well as the training length. For CGF systems without feedback delay, we prove that the optimal solutions coincide with those for nonfeedback systems. Moreover, we show that these solutions stay nearly optimal even in the presence of feedback delay. This finding is important for practical MIMO training design. For CCF systems, the optimal training length can be less than the number of transmit antennas, which is verified through numerical analysis. Taking this fact into account, we propose a simple yet near optimal transmission strategy for CCF systems, and derive the optimal temporal power allocation over pilot and data transmission.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design Guidelines for Training-Based MIMO Systems With Feedback","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2023930","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5238723/04982755.pdf","startPage":"4014","endPage":"4026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2023930","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238723","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4982755","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4982755/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Design Guidelines for Training-Based MIMO Systems With Feedback","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4982755/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10869464","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Guidelines for Training-Based MIMO Systems With Feedback","sourcePdf":"57tsp10-xzhou-2023930.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154395S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5238723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5238723","articleId":"4982755","onlineDate":"27 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4982756,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5238723/4982756/4982756-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hao Zhu (S'07) received the Bachelor's degree in information electronics and engineering from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2006.

Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that proposed ordering schemes using QR-decomposition not only require a reduced computational complexity compared to the conventional scheme, but result in improved error performance.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2009.2023942","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/4967994/04982758.pdf","startPage":"715","endPage":"718","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2009.2023942","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4967994","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Detection Ordering Scheme for MIMO Transmission Using Power Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4982758","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4982758/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Detection Ordering Scheme for MIMO Transmission Using Power Control","volume":"16","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10716923","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4982758/","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Detection Ordering Scheme for MIMO Transmission Using Power Control","sourcePdf":"lsp-hwang-2023942.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059329S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"4967994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4967994","articleId":"4982758","onlineDate":"27 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4982760,"authors":[{"name":"J\u00c9r\u00d4me Gauthier","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'Informatique Gaspard Monge CNRS UMR 8049, Universit\u00e9 Paris Est, Marne-la-Vallee, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5238723/4982760/4982760-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["J\u00e9r\u00f4me Gauthier (S'08\u2013M'08) was born in Rouen, France, in 1980. in 2004, he received the D.E.A. degree in analysis and stochastic models from the Universit\u00e9 de Rouen, France, and the Ph.D. degree in signal and image processing from the Laboratoire d'Informatique (UMR-CNRS 8049) of the Universit\u00e9 Paris-Est, France, on the topic of filter banks construction and optimization and their applications to Geosciences.","Since June 2008, he holds a postdoctoral position within the Signal and Image Processing Department of Telecom ParisTech, France, on the topic of Distributed Video Coding."]},"firstName":"J\u00c9r\u00d4me","lastName":"Gauthier","id":"37693748000"},{"name":"Laurent Duval","affiliation":["Technology, Computer Science and Applied Mathematics Division, IFP, Technology, Rueil-Malmaison, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5238723/4982760/4982760-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Laurent Duval (S'98\u2013M'01) was born in Cherbourg, France.

Given any complex oversampled FIR analysis FB, we first provide an algorithm to determine whether there exists an inverse FIR synthesis system. We also provide a method to ensure the Hermitian symmetry property on the synthesis side, which is serviceable to processing real-valued signals. As an invertible analysis scheme corresponds to a redundant decomposition, there is no unique inverse FB. Given a particular solution, we parameterize the whole family of inverses through a null space projection. The resulting reduced parameter set simplifies design procedures, since the perfect reconstruction constrained optimization problem is recast as an unconstrained optimization problem. The design of optimized synthesis FBs based on time or frequency localization criteria is then investigated, using a simple yet efficient gradient algorithm.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filter bank","Finite impulse response filter","Signal synthesis","Design optimization","Discrete Fourier transforms","Algorithm design and analysis","Signal processing","Null space","Constraint optimization","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FIR filters","gradient methods","signal reconstruction","signal sampling","signal synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["oversampled complex filter banks","FIR analysis","inverse FIR synthesis system","Hermitian symmetry property","invertible analysis scheme","perfect reconstruction constrained optimization problem","unconstrained optimization problem","gradient algorithm","finite impulse response"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Filter design","frequency localization","inversion","lapped transforms","modulated filter banks","optimization","oversampled filter banks","time localization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2023947","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5238723/04982760.pdf","startPage":"3827","endPage":"3843","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238723","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2023947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of Synthesis Oversampled Complex Filter Banks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4982760","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of Synthesis Oversampled Complex Filter Banks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4982760/","volume":"57","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4982760/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10869444","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of Synthesis Oversampled Complex Filter Banks","sourcePdf":"tsp-gauthier-2023947.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129148S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5238723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5238723","articleId":"4982760","onlineDate":"27 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4982762,"authors":[{"name":"Yafei Hou","affiliation":["Research Center for Information and Communication Systems, Ryukoku University, Shiga, Japan"],"firstName":"Yafei","lastName":"Hou","id":"37308078000"},{"name":"Tomohiro Hase","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Technology, Ryukoku University, Shiga, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomohiro","lastName":"Hase","id":"37269096900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"4982762","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvement on the Channel Estimation of Pilot Cyclic Prefixed Single Carrier (PCP-SC) System","abstract":"The pilot cyclic prefixed single carrier (PCP-SC) system has the ability to achieve channel estimation in a fast-fading environment.

To overcome this problem, two online soft sensors are proposed based upon a combined adaptive principal component analysis (PCA) and a radial basis functions (RBF) artificial neural network. For this purpose, a recursive PCA and a PCA based on a sliding window scheme are presented to adaptively extract the inherent features inside the measurements with high dimensions. The extracted low-dimension features are then used recursively as the main inputs to the RBF neural network. The developed online soft sensors are finally tested on a highly nonlinear distillation column benchmark problem to illustrate their effective performances.

By emulating the mathematical model responsible for generating the presets under normal operational conditions, the system works as an option to maintain plant operation in the event of a failure in the processing unit that executes the mathematical model. The system, built from the production data collected over six years of plant operation, steered to the replacement of the former backup operation mode (based on a lookup table), which degraded both product quality and plant productivity. The study showed that ANN are appropriated tools for the intended purpose and that, by this instrument, it is possible to achieve virtually all the presets needed by this kind of process. The text characterizes the problem, relates the investigated options to solve it, justifies the choice of the ANN approach, describes the methodology and system implementation and, finally, shows and discusses the attained results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4982793/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10665766","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4982793/","publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2009","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Preset generation for a steel tandem cold mill by means of a neural network tool","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preset generation for a steel tandem cold mill by means of a neural network tool","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"CA-7036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054532S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4914929","isNumber":"4982769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4914929","xplore-issue":"4982769","articleId":"4982793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4982842,"authors":[{"name":"Ran-Zan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ran-Zan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599478300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"4982842","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1041},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Virtual colonoscopy","Pixel","Protection","Image recognition","Decoding","Computational modeling","Security","Computer science","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["region incrementing visual cryptography","visual secrets","basis matrices","image sharing","secret sharing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image sharing","secret sharing","visual cryptography","visual secret sharing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4982842","abstract":"This letter presents a novel visual cryptography scheme, called region incrementing visual cryptography (RIVC), for sharing visual secrets with multiple secrecy levels in a single image.

We show that the spectrum-analysis architecture used by the biological cochlea is extremely efficient: analysis time, power and hardware usage all scale linearly with N, the number of output frequency bins, versus N log(N) for the Fast Fourier Transform. We also demonstrate two on-chip radio frequency (RF) spectrum analyzers inspired by the cochlea. They use exponentially-tapered transmission lines or filter cascades to model cochlear operation: Inductors map to fluid mass, capacitors to membrane stiffness and active elements (transistors) to active outer hair cell feedback mechanisms. Our RF cochlea chips, implemented in a 0.13 mum CMOS process, are 3 mm times 1.5 mm in size, have 50 exponentially-spaced output channels, have 70 dB of dynamic range, consume <300 mW of power and analyze the radio spectrum from 600 MHz to 8 GHz. Our work, which delivers insight into the efficiency of analog computation in the ear, may be useful in the front ends of ultra-wideband radio systems for fast, power-efficient spectral decomposition and analysis. Our novel rational cochlear transfer functions with zeros also enable improved audio silicon cochlea designs with sharper rolloff slopes and lower group delay than prior all-pole versions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4982858/04982879.pdf","startPage":"1814","endPage":"1828","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2009.2020465","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2009.2020465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982858","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4982879","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bio-Inspired Active Radio-Frequency Silicon Cochlea","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Silicon","Hardware","Spectral analysis","Wideband","Fast Fourier transforms","Power transmission lines","Filters","Semiconductor device modeling","Active inductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","ear","fast Fourier transforms","spectral analysers","transfer functions","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bio-inspired active radio frequency silicon cochlea","biological cochlea","fast Fourier transform","on-chip radio frequency spectrum analyzer","outer hair cell feedback mechanisms","CMOS process","ultrawideband radio systems","spectral decomposition","cochlear transfer functions","size 0.13 mum","size 3 mm","size 1.5 mm","frequency 600 MHz to 8 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bio-inspired","cochlear models","radio frequency (RF)","silicon cochlea","spectrum analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4982879/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Bio-Inspired Active Radio-Frequency Silicon Cochlea","volume":"44","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4982879/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10667205","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bio-Inspired Active Radio-Frequency Silicon Cochlea","sourcePdf":"44jssc06-rsarpeshkar-2020465.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147131S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4982858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4982858","articleId":"4982879","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4982882,"authors":[{"name":"Shahriar Shahramian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Shahriar","lastName":"Shahramian","id":"37270855700"},{"name":"Sorin P.

At mm-wave clock frequencies, skew due to mismatch in the clock and data distribution paths is a significant challenge for both flash and time-interleaved converter architectures. A full-rate front-end track and hold amplifier (THA) may be used to reduce the effect of skew. However, it is found that the THA output must then be distributed to the comparators with a bandwidth greater than the sampling frequency in order to preserve the flat regions of the track and hold waveform. Instead, if the data and clock distribution have very low skew, the THA can be omitted thus obviating the associated nonlinearities and resulting in improved performance. In this work, a tree of fully symmetric and linear BiCMOS buffers, called a ldquodata treerdquo, distributes the input to the comparator bank with a measured 3-dB bandwidth of 16 GHz. The data tree is integrated into a complete 4-bit ADC including a full-rate input THA that can be disabled and a 4-bit thermometer-code DAC for testing purposes. The chip occupies 2.5 mm times 3.2 mm including pads and is implemented in 0.18 mum SiGe BiCMOS technology. The ADC consumes 4.5 W from a 3.3 V supply while the DAC operates from a 5 V supply and consumes 0.5 W. The ADC has 3.7 ENOB with a 3-dB effective resolution bandwidth of 8 GHz and a full-scale differential input range of 0.24 V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">pp</sub>\n. With the THA enabled, the performance degrades rapidly beyond 8 GHz to less than 1-bit, but with the THA disabled, the ENOB remains better than 3-bits for inputs up to 11 GHz with an SFDR of better than 26 dB.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2009.2020657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2009.2020657","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4982858/04982882.pdf","startPage":"1709","endPage":"1720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 35-GS/s, 4-Bit Flash ADC With Active Data and Clock Distribution Trees","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A 35-GS/s, 4-Bit Flash ADC With Active Data and Clock Distribution Trees","volume":"44","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10667204","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4982882/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 35-GS/s, 4-Bit Flash ADC With Active Data and Clock Distribution Trees","sourcePdf":"jssc-shahramian-2020657.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050375S","chronDate":"June  2009","isNumber":"4982858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"49","articleId":"4982882","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4982883,"authors":[{"name":"Sterling R.

The UTRP is an NP-hard, highly constrained, multi-objective problem, for which the evaluation of candidate route sets can prove both time consuming and challenging, with many potential solutions rejected on the grounds of infeasibility. In this paper we propose a simple evolutionary multi-objective optimization technique to solve the UTRP. First we present a representation of the UTRP and introduce our two key objectives, which are to minimise both passenger costs and operator costs. Following this, we describe a simple multi-objective optimization algorithm for the UTRP then present experimental results obtained using the Mandl's benchmark data and a larger transport network.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4982923","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4982923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04982923.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple multi-objective optimization algorithm for the urban transit routing problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4982923/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A simple multi-objective optimization algorithm for the urban transit routing problem","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4982923/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10688505","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple multi-objective optimization algorithm for the urban transit routing problem","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp001-P293.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105224S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4982923","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4982926,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Current trends in the research of solving multi-objective problems (MOPs) require that the adopted optimization method provides an approximation of the Pareto set such that the user can understand the tradeoff between objectives and therefore make the final decision. Recently, an efficient framework, called MOEA/D, combining decomposition techniques in mathematics and optimization methods in evolutionary computation was proposed. MOEA/D decomposes a MOP to a set of single-objective problems (SOPs) with neighborhood relationship and approximates the Pareto set by solving these SOPs. In this paper, we attempt to enhance MOEA/D by proposing two mechanisms. To fully employ the information obtained from neighbors, we introduce a guided mutation operator to replace the differential evolution operator. Moreover, a update mechanism utilizing a priority queue is proposed for performance improvement when the SOPs obtained by decomposition are not uniformly distributed on the Pareto font. Different combinations of these approaches are compared based on the test problem instances proposed for the CEC 2009 competition. The set of problem instances include unconstrained and constrained MOPs with variable linkages. Experimental results are presented in the paper, and observations and discussion are also provided.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4982950","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04982950.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"216","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4982950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing MOEA/D with guided mutation and priority update for multi-objective optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4982950/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing MOEA/D with guided mutation and priority update for multi-objective optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688537","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4982950/","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing MOEA/D with guided mutation and priority update for multi-objective optimization","confLoc":"Trondheim","sourcePdf":"rp028-P385.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079607S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4982950","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4982955,"authors":[{"name":"Dragos Horvath","affiliation":["Universt\u00e9 de Strasbourg, France"],"firstName":"Dragos","lastName":"Horvath","id":"37833610300"},{"name":"Lorraine Brillet","affiliation":["Center of Bio-Active Molecules (CMBA), Commissariat a l''Energie Atomique, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Lorraine","lastName":"Brillet","id":"38073955500"},{"name":"Sylvaine Roy","affiliation":["Center of Bio-Active Molecules (CMBA), Commissariat \u00e0 \u013eEnergie Atomique, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Sylvaine","lastName":"Roy","id":"38062781900"},{"name":"Sebastien Conilleau","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'Infochimie, UMR 7177, Universt\u00e9 de Strasbourg, France"],"firstName":"Sebastien","lastName":"Conilleau","id":"38073955700"},{"name":"Alexandru-Adrian Tantar","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'Informatique Fondamentale de Lille (LIFL), Universit\u00e9 des et Technologies de Lille, France"],"firstName":"Alexandru-Adrian","lastName":"Tantar","id":"37689280100"},{"name":"Jean-Charles Boisson","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'Informatique Fondamentale de Lille (LIFL), Universit\u00e9 des et Technologies de Lille, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Charles","lastName":"Boisson","id":"37870828400"},{"name":"Nouredine Melab","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'Informatique Fondamentale de Lille (LIFL), Universit\u00e9 des Sciences et Technologies de Lille, France"],"firstName":"Nouredine","lastName":"Melab","id":"37297112700"},{"name":"El-Ghazali Talbi","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'Informatique Fondamentale de Lille (LIFL), Universit\u00e9 des Sciences et Technologies de Lille, France"],"firstName":"El-Ghazali","lastName":"Talbi","id":"37276569800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2958-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2959-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4982955","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4982955","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Proteins","Computational geometry","Information geometry","Space technology","Energy states","Solid modeling","Genetic algorithms","Grid computing","Fellows"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["divide and conquer methods","genetic algorithms","grid computing","proteins","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global search strategies","evolutionary GRID","conformational sampling","conformational docking","protein-ligand complexes","multimodal optimization","hybrid genetic algorithm","tabu strategy","divide-and-conquer planetary model"]}],"abstract":"Conformational sampling, the computational prediction of the experimental geometries of small proteins (folding) or of protein-ligand complexes (docking), is often cited as one of the most challenging multimodal optimization problems. Due to the extreme ruggedness of the energy landscape as a function of geometry, sampling heuristics must rely on an appropriate trade-off between global and local searching efforts. A previously reported ldquoplanetary strategyrdquo, a generalization of the classical island model used to deploy a hybrid genetic algorithm on computer grids, has shown a good ability to quickly discover low-energy geometries of small proteins and sugars, and sometimes even pinpoint their native structures-although not reproducibly. The procedure focused on broad exploration and used a tabu strategy to avoid revisiting the neighborhood of known solutions, at the risk of ldquoburyingrdquo important minima in overhastily set tabu areas. The strategy reported here, termed ldquodivide-and-conquer planetary modelrdquo couples this global search procedure to a local search tool. Grid nodes are now shared between global and local exploration tasks. The phase space is cut into ldquocellsrdquo corresponding to a specified sampling width for each of the N degrees of freedom. Global search locates cells containing low-energy geometries. Local searches pinpoint even deeper minima within a cell. Sampling width controls the important trade-off between the number of cells and the local search effort needed to reproducibly sample each cell. The probability to submit a cell to local search depends on the energy of the most stable geometry found within. Local searches are allotted limited resources and are not expected to converge. However, as long as they manage to discover some deeper local minima, the explored cell remains eligible for further local search, now relying on the improved energy level to enhance chances to be picked again. This competition prevents the system to waste too much effort in fruitless local searches. Eventually, after a limited number of local searches, a cell will be ldquoclosedrdquo and used - first as ldquoseedrdquo, later as tabu zone-to bias future global searches. Technical details and some folding and docking results will be discussed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4982955","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04982955.pdf","startPage":"247","endPage":"254","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4982955","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local vs. global search strategies in evolutionary GRID-based conformational sampling & docking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Local vs. global search strategies in evolutionary GRID-based conformational sampling & docking","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4982955/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688542","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4982955/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local vs. global search strategies in evolutionary GRID-based conformational sampling & docking","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp033-P052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05748S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4982955","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4982957,"authors":[{"name":"David Hecht","affiliation":["Southwestern College, Chula Vista, CA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Hecht","id":"37533309600"},{"name":"Mars Cheung","affiliation":["Natural Selection, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mars","lastName":"Cheung","id":"37554588100"},{"name":"Gary B.

In the past decade computational approaches, including evolutionary computation techniques, for searching for motifs have demonstrated good potential, and some results reported in literature are quite promising. Recently, some favorable progresses on evolutionary mining of motifs have been made and documented in GAME and GALF-P, where GAME employs a Bayesian-based scoring function and GALF-P aims to improve the algorithm performance with local filtering and adaptive post-processing. To improve discovering performance in terms of the recall, precision rates and algorithm reliability, this paper presents an alternative genetic algorithm termed as GAPK for resolving the problem of motifs discovery. In our proposed GAPK framework, a prior knowledge on motifs in a given dataset is used to initialize a population. Our technical contributions include a matrix representation for k-mers, a mismatch-based filtering method for search space reduction, a model mismatch score (MMS) as fitness function, new genetic operations and a model refinement processing. Some benchmarked datasets associated with eight transcription factors are used in our experiments. Comparative studies were carried out with well-known tools including GAME, GALF-P, MEME, MDScan and AlignACE. Results show that our method outperforms other techniques in terms of F-measure.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GAPK: Genetic algorithms with prior knowledge for motif discovery in DNA sequences","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4982959","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04982959.pdf","startPage":"277","endPage":"284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4982959","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4982959","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4982959/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"GAPK: Genetic algorithms with prior knowledge for motif discovery in DNA sequences","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4982959/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688531","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GAPK: Genetic algorithms with prior knowledge for motif discovery in DNA sequences","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp037-P061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083788S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4982959","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4982963,"authors":[{"name":"Benhui Chen","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Benhui","lastName":"Chen","id":"37600010900"},{"name":"Long Li","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Li","id":"37677491300"},{"name":"Jinglu Hu","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Jinglu","lastName":"Hu","id":"37278204200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2958-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2959-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4982963","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electronic design automation and methodology","Protein engineering","Sequences","Amino acids","Biological system modeling","Predictive models","Computational biology","Computational efficiency","Lattices","Genetic mutations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","genetic algorithms","probability","proteins","solid modelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protein structure prediction","3D protein folding structure HP model","estimation-of-distribution algorithm","computational biology","composite fitness function","probabilistic model","backtracking repairing algorithm","protein instance sequence","genetic algorithm"]}],"abstract":"The protein structure prediction (PSP) problem is one of the most important problems in computational biology. This paper proposes a novel Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) based method to solve the PSP problem on HP model. Firstly, a composite fitness function containing the information of folding structure core formation is introduced to replace the traditional fitness function of HP model. It can help to select more optimum individuals for probabilistic model of EDAs algorithm. And a set of guided operators are used to increase the diversity of population and the likelihood of escaping from local optima. Secondly, an improved backtracking repairing algorithm is proposed to repair invalid individuals sampled by the probabilistic model of EDAs for the long sequence protein instances. A detection procedure of feasibility is added to avoid entering invalid closed areas when selecting directions for the residues. Thus, it can significant reduce the number of backtracking operation and the computational cost for long sequence protein. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperform the basic EDAs method. At the same time, it is very competitive with the other existing algorithms for the PSP problem on lattice HP models.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4982963","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04982963.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4982963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","startPage":"309","endPage":"315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel EDAs based method for HP model protein folding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4982963","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel EDAs based method for HP model protein folding","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4982963/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688535","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4982963/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel EDAs based method for HP model protein folding","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp041-P200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073695S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4982963","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4982972,"authors":[{"name":"Changhe Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK"],"firstName":"Changhe","lastName":"Li","id":"37536361900"},{"name":"Shengxiang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK"],"firstName":"Shengxiang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37279520600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2958-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2959-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4982972","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":317},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4982972","abstract":"Traditional particle swarm optimization (PSO) suffers from the premature convergence problem, which usually results in PSO being trapped in local optima. This paper presents an adaptive learning PSO (ALPSO) based on a variant PSO learning strategy. In ALPSO, the learning mechanism of each particle is separated into three parts: its own historical best position, the closest neighbor and the global best one. By using this individual level adaptive technique, a particle can well guide its behavior of exploration and exploitation. A set of 21 test functions were used including un-rotated, rotated and composition functions to test the performance of ALPSO. From the comparison results over several variant PSO algorithms, ALPSO shows an outstanding performance on most test functions, especially the fast convergence characteristic.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4982972","startPage":"381","endPage":"388","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04982972.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4982972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive learning particle swarm optimizer for function optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Convergence","Testing","Learning systems","Organisms","Birds","Marine animals","Educational institutions","Cognition","Cultural differences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","learning (artificial intelligence)","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive learning","particle swarm optimization","function optimization","premature convergence problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4982972/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive learning particle swarm optimizer for function optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4982972/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688554","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive learning particle swarm optimizer for function optimization","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp050-P705.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077585S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4982972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4982979,"authors":[{"name":"Changhe Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK"],"firstName":"Changhe","lastName":"Li","id":"37536361900"},{"name":"Shengxiang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK"],"firstName":"Shengxiang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37279520600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2958-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2959-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4982979","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":52,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":485},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A clustering particle swarm optimizer for dynamic optimization","abstract":"In the real world, many applications are nonstationary optimization problems. This requires that optimization algorithms need to not only find the global optimal solution but also track the trajectory of the changing global best solution in a dynamic environment.

The algorithm employs hierarchical clustering method to track multiple peaks based on a nearest neighbor search strategy. A fast local search method is also proposed to find the near optimal solutions in a local promising region in the search space. Six test problems generated from a generalized dynamic benchmark generator (GDBG) are used to test the performance of the proposed algorithm.

The performance of current state of the art algorithms (e.g. NSGA-II, SPEA2) is known to deteriorate significantly with increasing number of objectives due to the lack of adequate convergence pressure. It is of no surprise that the performance of NSGA-II on some constrained many-objective optimization problems (Deb and Saxena, 2006) (e.g., DTLZ5-(5,M), M = 10, 20) in an earlier study (Saxena, 2008) was far from satisfactory. Till date, research in many-objective optimization has focussed on two major areas (a) dimensionality reduction in the objective space and (b) preference ordering based approaches. This paper introduces a novel evolutionary algorithm powered by epsilon dominance (implemented within the framework of NSGA-II) and controlled infeasibility for improved convergence while the critical set of objectives is identified through a nonlinear dimensionality reduction scheme. Since approaching the Pareto-optimal front from within the feasible search space will need to overcome the problems associated with low selection pressure, the mechanism to approach the front from within the infeasible search space is promising as illustrated in this paper. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with NSGA-II (original, with crowding distance measure) and NSGA-II (epsilon dominance) on the above set of constrained multiobjective problems to highlight the benefits.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4982993","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04982993.pdf","startPage":"545","endPage":"552","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4982993","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constrained many-objective optimization: A way forward","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4982993/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Constrained many-objective optimization: A way forward","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688624","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4982993/","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constrained many-objective optimization: A way forward","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp071-P345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062889S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4982993","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4982999,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Such neural networks were able to discover game-playing strategies through co-evolution, where the neural networks just play against themselves across generations. The effect of the spatial processing layer on evolution was investigated. It was found that the evolutionary process was crucially dependent on the way in which spatial information was presented. A simple sampling pattern based on the squares attacked by a single queen in Chess resulted the networks converging to a solution in which the majority of networks, handicapped by playing black and playing without using any look-ahead algorithm, could defeat a positional strategy using look-ahead at plydepth=4 and a piece-differential strategy using look-ahead at ply-depth=6. Improvement and convergence was observed to be accompanied by an gradual increase in the survival time of neural network strategies from less than 10 generations to about 600 generations. Surprisingly, evolved neural networks had difficulty in defeating a simple mobility strategy playing at a ply-depth=2. This work suggests that in deciding a suitable way to spatially sample a board position, it is important to consider the rules of the game.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983006","startPage":"646","endPage":"651","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983006.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial processing layer effects on the evolution of neural networks to play the game of Othello","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Law","Legal factors","Costs","Noise reduction","Genetic programming","Sampling methods","Automatic testing","Multi-layer neural network"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer games","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial processing layer effects","neural network evolution","zero-sum game","reversi","game-playing strategies","evolutionary process","Chess","piece-differential strategy","Othello"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983006/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Spatial processing layer effects on the evolution of neural networks to play the game of Othello","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983006/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688630","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial processing layer effects on the evolution of neural networks to play the game of Othello","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp084-P101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033083S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4983007,"authors":[{"name":"Niels van Hoorn","affiliation":["Dalle Molle Institute for Perceptive Artificial Intelligence, Lugano, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Niels","lastName":"van Hoorn","id":"38075878800"},{"name":"Julian Togelius","affiliation":["Dalle Molle Institute for Perceptive Artificial Intelligence, Lugano, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Julian","lastName":"Togelius","id":"38483272100"},{"name":"Daan Wierstra","affiliation":["Dalle Molle Institute for Perceptive Artificial Intelligence, Lugano, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Daan","lastName":"Wierstra","id":"37691601800"},{"name":"Jurgen Schmidhuber","affiliation":["Dalle Molle Institute for Perceptive Artificial Intelligence, Lugano, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Jurgen","lastName":"Schmidhuber","id":"37304241400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2958-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2959-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4983007","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":373},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4983007","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Humans","Computational intelligence","Testing","Artificial intelligence","Evolutionary computation","Drives","Design optimization","Learning","Working environment noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer games","evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust player imitation","multiobjective evolutionary algorithms","videogame NPC AI","player behaviour","progress-based fitness","racing game"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983007","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983007.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","startPage":"652","endPage":"659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust player imitation using multiobjective evolution","abstract":"The problem of how to create NPC AI for videogames that believably imitates particular human players is addressed.

This idea is explored in the context of a modern racing game.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983007/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10688631","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983007/","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robust player imitation using multiobjective evolution","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust player imitation using multiobjective evolution","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp085-P364.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044912S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983007","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4983009,"authors":[{"name":"Anna Rakitianskaia","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, School of Information Technology, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa"],"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Rakitianskaia","id":"37691979200"},{"name":"Andries P.

In this paper, we identify some of the most relevant types of heterogeneity that can be ascribed to particle swarms. A number of particle swarms are classified according to the type of heterogeneity they exhibit, which allows us to identify some gaps in current knowledge about heterogeneity in PSO algorithms.

The use of a scale-free topology instead of the usual regular or global neighborhoods is intended to bring to the search procedure a better capability of exploring promising regions without a premature convergence, which would result in the procedure being easily trapped in a local optimum. The performance of the CNPSO is compared with the standard PSO on some well-known and high-dimensional benchmark functions, ranging from multimodal to plateau-like problems.

Previous studies indicated that search abilities can be improved by simply coupling these two algorithms; GA compensates for the low diversity of PSO, while PSO compensates for the high computational costs of GA. In this study, the configurations of the two methods when used in a fully coupled hybrid algorithm were investigated to achieve an improvement in diversity and convergence simultaneously for application to real-world engineering design problems. The new hybrid algorithm was validated using standard test function problems, and it was demonstrated that the new hybrid algorithm showed better performance than the simply coupled hybrid algorithm, as well as both pure GA and pure PSO. Especially, the new hybrid algorithm shows robust search ability regardless of initial population selection. This feature is very important in real-world engineering design problems, which do not allow multiple optimization runs to be implemented due to heavy computational costs. The new method was applied to optimization of a diesel engine combustion chamber to reduce exhaust emissions, such as NOx and soot. The results demonstrated the applicability of the present method to real-world design problems. In addition, important geometry design variables controlling the emission performance were investigated to obtain useful knowledge about low emission diesel engine design.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983024","startPage":"777","endPage":"784","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983024.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development and investigation of efficient GA/PSO-hybrid algorithm applicable to real-world design optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design optimization","Computational efficiency","Design engineering","Diesel engines","Genetic algorithms","Particle swarm optimization","Convergence","Algorithm design and analysis","Testing","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combustion","diesel engines","genetic algorithms","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","particle swarm optimization","real-world engineering design problems","standard test function problems","coupled hybrid algorithm","diesel engine combustion chamber","low emission diesel engine design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983024/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Development and investigation of efficient GA/PSO-hybrid algorithm applicable to real-world design optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983024/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688569","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development and investigation of efficient GA/PSO-hybrid algorithm applicable to real-world design optimization","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp102-P347.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061921S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983024","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4983030,"authors":[{"name":"Timo Mantere","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Automation, University of Vaasa, Vaasa, Finland"],"firstName":"Timo","lastName":"Mantere","id":"37372629300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2958-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2959-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4983030","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4983030","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Independent component analysis","Testing","Biological cells","Genetic mutations","Image classification","Image reconstruction","Traveling salesman problems","Cities and towns","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular automata","genetic algorithms","graph theory","image classification","travelling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image ordering","cellular genetic algorithm","TSP","ICA","cellular automata","image classification","image distances","traveling salesman solver","shortest route order"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983030","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983030.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","startPage":"822","endPage":"829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983030","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image ordering by cellular genetic algorithms with TSP and ICA","abstract":"We have studied the use of cellular automata and cellular genetic algorithms for the image classification and ordering problems.

For example, PSO (particle swarm optimization) shows high ability during initial period in general, whereas DE (differential evolution) shows high ability especially in the latter period in search to find more accurate solutions. This paper proposes a novel and integrated framework to effectively combine the merits of several evolutionary computations. There are five distinctive features in the proposed framework. 1) There are several individual pools, and each pool corresponds to one EC. 2) Parents do not necessarily belong to the same EC: for example, a GA type individual can be a spouse of a PSO type individual. 3) Each incorporated EC has its own evaluated value (EV), and it changes according to the best fitness value at each generation. 4) The number of individuals in each EC changes according to the EV. 5) All of the individuals have their own lifetime to avoid premature convergence; when an individual meets lifetime, the individual reselect EC, and the probability of each EC to be selected depends on the EV. In the proposed framework, therefore, more individuals are allotted to the ECs which show higher performance than the other at each generation: effective usage of individuals is enabled. In this way, this framework can make use of merits of incorporated ECs. Original GA, original PSO and original DE are used to construct a simple proposed framework-based system. We carried out experiments using well-known benchmark functions. The results show that the new system outperformed there incorporated ECs in 9 functions out of 13 functions.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","startPage":"838","endPage":"845","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983032.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An integrated framework of hybrid evolutionary computations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983032/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4983032/","displayDocTitle":"An integrated framework of hybrid evolutionary computations","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688598","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An integrated framework of hybrid evolutionary computations","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp110-P339.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072019S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983032","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4983033,"authors":[{"name":"Sousuke Tooyama","affiliation":["Faculty of Systems Engineering, Shibaura Institute of Technology, Japan"],"lastName":"Sousuke Tooyama","id":"38075884100"},{"name":"Hiroshi Hasegawa","affiliation":["Faculty of Systems Engineering, Shibaura Institute of Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Hasegawa","id":"38062719600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2958-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2959-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4983033","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Plan system with Genetic Algorithm using the Variable Neighborhood range Control","abstract":"To improve the calculation cost and the convergence to optimal solutions for multi-peak optimization problems with multiple dimensions, we propose a new evolutionary algorithm, which is an Adaptive plan system with genetic algorithm (APGA). This is an approach that combines the global search ability of a GA and an Adaptive Plan with excellent local search ability. The APGA differs from GAs in how it handles design variable vectors. GAs generally encode design variable vectors into genes, and handle them through GA operations. However, the APGA encodes the control variable vectors of the Adaptive Plan, which searches for local minima, into its genes. The control variable vectors determine the global behavior of the AP, and design variable vectors are handled by the AP in the optimization process of the APGA. In this paper, the Variable Neighborhood range Control (VNC), which changes a neighborhood range based on an individual's situation-fitness, is introduced into the APGA to dramatically improve the convergence up to the optimal solution. The APGA/VNC is applied to some benchmark functions to evaluate its performance. We confirmed satisfactory performance through these various benchmark tests.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive systems","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Genetic algorithms","Control systems","Benchmark testing","Cost function","Evolutionary computation","Design optimization","Optimal control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive systems","convergence","genetic algorithms","minimisation","planning (artificial intelligence)","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive plan system","genetic algorithm","variable neighborhood range control","convergence","multipeak optimization problem","global search","local search","local minima"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4983033","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983033","startPage":"846","endPage":"853","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983033.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983033","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983033/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Plan system with Genetic Algorithm using the Variable Neighborhood range Control","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688599","htmlLink":"/document/4983033/","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Plan system with Genetic Algorithm using the Variable Neighborhood range Control","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp111-P663.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.190282S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983033","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4983038,"authors":[{"name":"Tomislav Rolich","affiliation":["Faculty of Textile Technology, University of Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Tomislav","lastName":"Rolich","id":"38075874400"},{"name":"Darko Grundler","affiliation":["Faculty of Textile Technology, University of Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Darko","lastName":"Grundler","id":"37544518600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2958-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2959-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4983038","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4983038","abstract":"Paper describes method for finding transmitter parameters (location and power) for optimal electromagnetic radiation distribution in observed area.

However, the effect of lower communication failure on the performance of distributed GA varies with the topologies when population size is small. For all the tree topologies we investigated, when communications failures occur extremely frequently, then a significant performance degradation is observed. However, even in these extreme cases, we show that simple retry/reroute protocols for recovering from communication failure are sufficient to recover most of the performance.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983050","startPage":"968","endPage":"975","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983050.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault tolerance in distributed genetic algorithms with tree topologies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983050/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fault tolerance in distributed genetic algorithms with tree topologies","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983050/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10688632","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault tolerance in distributed genetic algorithms with tree topologies","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp128-P301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043356S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983050","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4983055,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Tami Al-Hajri","affiliation":["Power Distribution Department, Saudi Aramco Oil Company, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Muhammad Tami","lastName":"Al-Hajri","id":"38300135900"},{"name":"M.

During this process the interconnection of neighboring as well as more distant nerve cells to smaller or global networks is guaranteed by axonal growth. Furthermore, during the process of connecting and synchronizing of networks, the inactive synapses became active once, the cell function may be transfigured from a catalyzing to a blocking one, that allows the conclusion of axonal growth as being an important modifier and influence in the process. Considering the discoveries, the axonal growth needs to be followed and analyzed in order to draw more scientific and detailed conclusions about the self-organizational potentials of nerve cells, the focusing on blocking and catalyzing aspects and their importance for the development of independent networks. A software is needed which enables the scientists to evaluate the nerve cell connections and applicate a statistical analysis of axonal growth. The results of this analysis may be used to create a model which simulates the self-organizational abilities of biological networks. [11] proposes a usage of those models as templates for artificial neuronal networks displaying the biological aspects more detailed than the currently available models. In this work we present a axon segmentation algorithm, based on a fuzzy-controlled system. The problems that appear, is that a correct setting of the rule-set can hardly be known, so we prove to optimize the rule-set with evolutionary algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983058","startPage":"1025","endPage":"1031","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983058.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving fuzzy-based axon segmentation with genetic algorithms: The IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983058/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improving fuzzy-based axon segmentation with genetic algorithms: The IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983058/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10688640","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving fuzzy-based axon segmentation with genetic algorithms: The IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp136-P414.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.139242S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983058","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4983060,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37656221100"},{"name":"Hong Fu","affiliation":["Center of Multimedia Signal Processing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Fu","id":"37414023900"},{"name":"Zhen Liang","affiliation":["Center of Multimedia Signal Processing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Liang","id":"37591786900"},{"name":"Xiaoyu Zhao","affiliation":["Center of Multimedia Signal Processing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyu","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37696887100"},{"name":"Zheru Chi","affiliation":["Center of Multimedia Signal Processing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Zheru","lastName":"Chi","id":"37273718900"},{"name":"Dagan Feng","affiliation":["School of Information Technologies, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Dagan","lastName":"Feng","id":"37289600600"},{"name":"Xinbo Zhao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Contemporary Design & Integrated Manufacturing Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Xinbo","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37293147700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2958-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2959-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4983060","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":184},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Humans","Computational modeling","Sampling methods","Physiology","Psychology","Machine vision","Retina","Tracking","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","eye","genetic algorithms","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eye movement data modeling","genetic algorithm","region of interest map","saliency map","short time memory","saccades distribution","retina model","eye tracker","obvious-object image group","non-obvious-object image group"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4983060","abstract":"We present a computational model of human eye movements based on a genetic algorithm (GA).

Our model can produce the scan path of a subject viewing an image, not just several fixations points or artificial ROI's as in the other models. We have also developed both subjective and objective methods to evaluate the model by comparing its behavior with the real eye movement data collected from an eye tracker. Tested on 18 (9 times 2) images from both an obvious-object image group and a non-obvious-object image group, the subjective evaluations shows very close scores between the scan paths generated by the GA model and those real scan paths; for the objective evaluation, experimental results show that the distance between GA's scan paths and human scan paths of the same image has no significant difference by a probability of 78.9% on average.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983060","startPage":"1038","endPage":"1044","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983060.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Eye movement data modeling using a genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983060/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Eye movement data modeling using a genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983060/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10688642","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Eye movement data modeling using a genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp138-P269.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121045S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983060","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4983073,"authors":[{"name":"Jose C.

However, the interactions between multiple tunable protocol parameters and multiple sensornet performance metrics are generally complex and unknown. In this paper we address this multi-dimensional optimisation problem by two distinct approaches. Firstly, we apply a Design Of Experiments approach to obtain a generalised linear interaction model, and from this derive an estimated near-optimal solution. Secondly, we apply the Two-Archive evolutionary algorithm to improve solution quality for a specific problem instance. We demonstrate that, whereas the first approach yields a more generally applicable solution, the second approach yields a broader range of viable solutions at potentially lower experimental cost.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983074","startPage":"1137","endPage":"1144","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983074.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparing design of experiments and evolutionary approaches to multi-objective optimisation of sensornet protocols","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design optimization","Protocols","Energy efficiency","Application software","Measurement","Hardware","US Department of Energy","Evolutionary computation","Space exploration","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design of experiments","evolutionary computation","protocols","quality of service","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design of experiments","multi-objective optimisation","quality of service","multiple tunable protocol parameters","multiple sensornet performance metrics","multidimensional optimisation problem","two-archive evolutionary algorithm","generalised linear interaction model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983074/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Comparing design of experiments and evolutionary approaches to multi-objective optimisation of sensornet protocols","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983074/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688669","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing design of experiments and evolutionary approaches to multi-objective optimisation of sensornet protocols","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp152-P287.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064458S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4983076,"authors":[{"name":"Kalyanmoy Deb","affiliation":["Department of Business Technology, Helsinki School of Economics, Helsinki, Finland"],"firstName":"Kalyanmoy","lastName":"Deb","id":"37272206800"},{"name":"Ankur Sinha","affiliation":["Department of Business Technology, Helsinki School of Economics, Helsinki, Finland"],"firstName":"Ankur","lastName":"Sinha","id":"37555963700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2958-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2959-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4983076","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":318},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability","System testing","Problem-solving","Constraint optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bilevel evolutionary multiobjective optimization","bilevel optimization test problem construction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4983076","abstract":"Many real-world problems demand a feasible solution to satisfy physical equilibrium, stability, or certain properties which require an additional lower level optimization problem to be solved. Although such bilevel problems are studied somewhat in the context of a single objective in each level, there are not many studies in which multiple conflicting objectives are considered in each level. Bilevel multi-objective optimization problems offer additional complexities, as not every lower level Pareto-optimal front has a representative solution to the upper level Pareto-optimal front and that only a tiny fraction of participating lower level fronts make it to the upper level front. A couple of recent studies by the authors have suggested a viable EMO method to handle such problems. In this paper, we analyze the difficulties which a bilevel EMO procedure may face in handling such problems and present a systematic construction procedure for bilevel optimization test problems. Based on the suggested principles, we propose five test problems which are scalable in terms of number of variables and objectives, and which enable researchers to evaluate different phases of a bilevel problem solving task. The test problem construction procedure is interesting and may motivate other researchers to extend the idea to develop further test problems.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983076","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983076.pdf","startPage":"1153","endPage":"1160","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constructing test problems for bilevel evolutionary multi-objective optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983076/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Constructing test problems for bilevel evolutionary multi-objective optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688671","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4983076/","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constructing test problems for bilevel evolutionary multi-objective optimization","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp154-P545.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088333S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983076","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4983079,"authors":[{"name":"Gautam Roy","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Texas A and M University, USA"],"firstName":"Gautam","lastName":"Roy","id":"38072324100"},{"name":"Hyunyoung Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Texas A and M University, USA"],"firstName":"Hyunyoung","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280121700"},{"name":"Jennifer L.

Processors extract individuals from the pool in order to perform the computations and then insert the resulting individuals back into the pool. Unlike previously proposed approaches, the new approach is tailored for distributed systems in which processors are loosely coupled, failure-prone and can run at different speeds. Proof-of-concept simulation results are presented indicating that the approach can deliver improved performance due to the distribution and tolerates a large fraction of crash failures.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983079","startPage":"1177","endPage":"1184","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983079.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A distributed pool architecture for genetic algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Master-slave","Computer crashes","Parallel processing","Computer architecture","Distributed computing","Product design","Genetic engineering","Computational modeling","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed pool architecture","genetic algorithms","parallel computing","distributed computing","distributed storage","loosely coupled processors","failure-prone processors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983079/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A distributed pool architecture for genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983079/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688674","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A distributed pool architecture for genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp157-P533.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071971S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983079","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4983080,"authors":[{"name":"Ye-Hoon Kim","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ye-Hoon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37406993600"},{"name":"Jong-Hwan Kim","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Hwan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37281186400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2958-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2959-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4983080","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":267},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4983080","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Evolutionary computation","Path planning","Mobile robots","Quantum computing","Fuzzy systems","Navigation","Electronic design automation and methodology","Sorting","Space exploration","Fuzzy sets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","fuzzy control","mobile robots","multi-robot systems","Pareto optimisation","path planning","quantum computing","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm","robust fuzzy path planning","mobile robot","probabilistic mechanism","quantum computing","Pareto-optimal solution set","robot soccer system","elapsed time","heading direction","posture angle errors"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983080","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983080.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","startPage":"1185","endPage":"1192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983080","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm for fuzzy path planning of mobile robot","abstract":"This paper proposes a multiobjective quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm (MQEA) to design efficient fuzzy path planner of mobile robot.

The FFPP is to determine the flight frequency for each type of aircraft on each flight route. This problem is fundamental to an airline's operational planning because it affects the airline's profit and market share greatly. The FFPP can be formulated as an integer programming problem with constraints that is very suitable to be solved by the PSO algorithm. The proposed PSO-FFPP algorithm codes the decision variables of the FFPP with real number to represent the potential solutions and defines the optimization objective as a maximization problem for the airlines profit. A constraints handling method that combines the ideas of feasible solution preserving and infeasible solution rejection is developed. This method avoids the expense of infeasibility repair or penalty, making the algorithm simple to use and easy to extend. An integer handing process is also devised to round the real number to the nearest valid integer before feasibility check and function evaluation. This process maintains the search tendency of the PSO algorithm and can help to search in a promising region for the global optimum. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated and compared with the Monte Carlo method and the enumeration method on a simulation case with promising results. Experiments are also conducted to investigate the factors that affect the solution quality and computational time.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983105","startPage":"1383","endPage":"1390","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983105.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solving the flight frequency programming problem with particle swarm optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Particle swarm optimization","Aircraft","Job shop scheduling","Linear programming","Financial advantage program","Computer science","Sun","Application specific processors","Tail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft","constraint handling","operations research","particle swarm optimisation","travel industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flight frequency programming problem","particle swarm optimization","operational planning","maximization problem","airlines profit","constraints handling method","Monte Carlo method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983105/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Solving the flight frequency programming problem with particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983105/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688700","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving the flight frequency programming problem with particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp183-P280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091948S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983105","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4983106,"authors":[{"name":"Tiago L.

Three genetic algorithms which embed candidate solutions in the continuous space are proposed here for solving the DCMST. The results achieved by these three algorithms have been compared with four other existing algorithms according to three merit criteria: i) quality of the best solution found; ii) computational effort spent by the algorithm, and; iii) convergence tendency of the population. The three proposed algorithms have provided better results for both solution quality and population convergence, with reasonable computational cost, in tests performed for 25-node and 50-node test instances. The results suggest that the proposed algorithms are well suited for dealing with the problem under study.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983106","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983106.pdf","startPage":"1391","endPage":"1398","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous-space embedding genetic algorithm applied to the Degree Constrained Minimum Spanning Tree Problem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4983106","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983106/","displayDocTitle":"Continuous-space embedding genetic algorithm applied to the Degree Constrained Minimum Spanning Tree Problem","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688701","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983106/","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous-space embedding genetic algorithm applied to the Degree Constrained Minimum Spanning Tree Problem","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp184-P097.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105198S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983106","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4983112,"authors":[{"name":"Katherine M.

This research aims to analytically characterise individual problems as a first step towards attempting to link problem types with the algorithms best suited to solving them.

Experiments run on test functions with increasing ruggedness show that the proposed measure of ruggedness produced relative values consistent with a visual inspection of the problem landscapes. Combined with other measures of complexity, the proposed ruggedness measure could be used to more broadly characterise the complexity of fitness landscapes in continuous domains.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983112","startPage":"1440","endPage":"1447","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983112.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantifying ruggedness of continuous landscapes using entropy","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Entropy","Particle measurements","Polynomials","Computational intelligence","Algorithm design and analysis","Information analysis","Testing","Inspection","Prediction algorithms","Labeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","entropy","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["population-based optimisation algorithm","continuous landscape ruggedness measure","entropy method","computational intelligence","information theoretic technique","complexity measure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983112/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Quantifying ruggedness of continuous landscapes using entropy","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983112/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688707","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantifying ruggedness of continuous landscapes using entropy","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp190-P257.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054015S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983112","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4983113,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The proposed CCPSO algorithms out-performed a previously developed coevolving PSO algorithm on nonseparable functions of 30 dimensions. Furthermore, the scalability of the proposed algorithm to high dimensional nonseparable problems (of up to 1000 dimensions) is examined and compared with two existing coevolving differential evolution (DE) algorithms, and new insights are obtained. Our experimental results show the proposed CCPSO algorithms can perform reasonably well with only a small number of evaluations. The results also suggest that both the random grouping and adaptive weighting schemes are viable approaches that can be generalized to other evolutionary optimization methods.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983126","startPage":"1546","endPage":"1553","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983126.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tackling high dimensional nonseparable optimization problems by cooperatively coevolving particle swarms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983126/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Tackling high dimensional nonseparable optimization problems by cooperatively coevolving particle swarms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983126/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10688721","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tackling high dimensional nonseparable optimization problems by cooperatively coevolving particle swarms","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp204-P190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050268S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983126","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-05"},{"_id":4983129,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Baptiste Mouret","affiliation":["Institut des Syst\u00e8mes Intelligents, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie et de Robotique, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Baptiste","lastName":"Mouret","id":"37586421200"},{"name":"Stephane Doncieux","affiliation":["Institut des Syst\u00e8mes Intelligents, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie et de Robotique, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Stephane","lastName":"Doncieux","id":"37568716500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2958-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2959-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4983129","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Evolutionary computation","Organisms","Neural networks","Evolution (biology)","Optimization methods","Algorithm design and analysis","Process design","Computer networks","Boolean functions","Bones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boolean functions","evolutionary computation","gradient methods","neural nets","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modular neural-network","exaptation phenomenon","multiple selection gradient","Pareto-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm","genotype","Boolean function","Shapley value analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4983129","abstract":"Despite their success as optimization methods, evolutionary algorithms face many difficulties to design artifacts with complex structures. According to paleontologists, living organisms evolved by opportunistically co-opting characters adapted to a function to solve new problems, a phenomenon called exaptation. In this paper, we draw the hypotheses (1) that exaptation requires the presence of multiple selection pressures, (2) that Pareto-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) can create such pressures and (3) that the modularity of the genotype is a key to enable exaptation. To explore these hypotheses, we designed an evolutionary process to find the structure and the parameters of neural networks to compute a Boolean function with a modular structure. We then analyzed the role of each component using a Shapley value analysis. Our results show that: (1) the proposed method is efficient to evolve neural networks to solve this task; (2) genotypic modules and multiple selections gradients needed to be aligned to converge faster than the control experiments. This prominent role of multiple selection pressures contradicts the basic assumption that underlies most published modular methods for the evolution of neural networks, in which only the modularity of the genotype is considered.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983129","startPage":"1570","endPage":"1577","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983129.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolving modular neural-networks through exaptation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983129/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evolving modular neural-networks through exaptation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983129/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10688724","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolving modular neural-networks through exaptation","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp207-P146.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076702S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983129","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4983135,"authors":[{"name":"Hendrik Richter","affiliation":["Fachbereich Elektrotechnik und Informationstechnik, Institut Mess Steuerungs Und Regelungstechnik, Leipzig, Germany"],"firstName":"Hendrik","lastName":"Richter","id":"37555537900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2958-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2959-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4983135","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":357},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Evolutionary computation","Particle swarm optimization","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Change detection algorithms","Monitoring","Data mining","Benchmark testing","Statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","statistical testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["population-based change detection","dynamic fitness landscape","evolutionary algorithm","sensor-based change detection","statistical hypothesis testing","receiver-operating characteristics","dimensionality problem"]}],"abstract":"Change detection enables an evolutionary algorithm operating in a dynamic environment to respond with undertaking necessary steps for maintaining its performance.

Since the emission quantities observed by the instruments via experiments are used as the constraints, observation noise has to be considered. In this paper, we define this problem as dasiaNoisy constrained MOPspsila and investigate the difficulties for evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO).

This paper is concerned with the design of an effective genetic algorithm (GA) for tackling the network coding problem (NCP). Differing from previous relevant works, the proposed GA is designed based on a permutation representation, which not only allows each chromosome to record a specific network protocol and coding scheme, but also makes it easy to integrate useful problem-specific heuristic rules into the algorithm. In the new GA, a more general fitness function is proposed, which, besides considering the minimization of network coding resources, also takes into account the maximization of the rate actually achieved. This new fitness function makes the proposed GA more suitable for the case of dynamic network coding, where any link could be cut off at any time, and consequently, the target rate might become unachievable even if all nodes allow coding. Based on the new representation and fitness function, other GA related techniques are modified and employed accordingly and carefully. Comparative experiments show that the proposed GA clearly outperforms previous methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983148/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10688743","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983148/","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An effective Genetic Algorithm for the network coding problem","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An effective Genetic Algorithm for the network coding problem","confLoc":"Trondheim","sourcePdf":"rp226-P428.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061827S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983148","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4983152,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen Chen","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, York University Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Chen","id":"38042460500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2958-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2959-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4983152","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":358},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Space exploration","Convergence","Displays","Genetic algorithms","Simulated annealing","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","particle swarm optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["locust swarms","multioptima search technique","convex search spaces","greedy local search","Schwefel function"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4983152","abstract":"Locust swarms are a new multi-optima search technique explicitly designed for non-globally convex search spaces.

These scouts start a minimum distance away from the previous optimum, and this gap is an important part of achieving a non-convergent search trajectory. Equally, the search for ldquosmartrdquo start points centers around the previous local optimum, and this provides the basis for also having a non-random search trajectory.

As a result, the proposed algorithm produced better performance than the single genetic algorithm in terms of the classification accuracy with the feature subsets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983164/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10688759","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983164/","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Distributed genetic algorithm using automated adaptive migration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed genetic algorithm using automated adaptive migration","confLoc":"Trondheim","sourcePdf":"rp242-P600.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062373S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4983166,"authors":[{"name":"Juan C.

In the hybrid GA scheme, aircraft queues to gates are projected as points into a parameterized space. A deterministic model inspired by the phenomenon of natural ripple-spreading on liquid surfaces is developed which uses relative spatial parameters as input to connect all aircraft points to construct aircraft queues to gates, and then a traditional binary GA compatible to all classic evolutionary operators is used to evolve these spatial parameters in order to find an optimal or near-optimal solution.

Consequently chip-design becomes more and more challenging. Therefore an approach that allows a fast and efficient application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) design is needed. Especially the organization of Chip-Design projects exhibits a very high complexity. Different tools can be used to execute the same task, resulting in a huge number of different possible design flows. The number of valid flows is delimited by different constraints.

The extended NrGA model, Continuous NrGA (cNrGA), employs the same tree-structure archive of NrGA to memorize the evaluated solutions, in which the search space is divided into non-overlapped partitions according to the distribution of the solutions. cNrGA is a bi-modulus evolutionary algorithm consisting of the genetic algorithm module (GAM) and the adaptive mutation module (AMM). When GAM generates an offspring, the offspring is sent to AMM and is mutated according to the density of the solutions stored in the memory archive. For a point in the search space with high solution-density, it infers a high probability that the point is close to the optimum and hence a near search is suggested. Alternatively, a far search is recommended for a point with low solution-density. Benefitting from the space partitioning scheme, a fast solution-density approximation is obtained. Also, the adaptive mutation scheme naturally avoid the generation of out-of-bound solutions. The performance of cNrGA is tested on 14 benchmark functions on dimensions ranging from 2 to 40. It is compared with real coded GA, differential evolution, covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy and two improved particle swarm optimization. The simulation results show that cNrGA outperforms the other algorithms for multi-modal function optimization.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983172","startPage":"1896","endPage":"1903","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983172.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous non-revisiting genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Genetic mutations","History","Evolutionary computation","Particle swarm optimization","Space exploration","Covariance matrix","Partitioning algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","covariance matrices","genetic algorithms","particle swarm optimisation","probability","search problems","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous NrGA model","nonrevisiting genetic algorithm","continuous search space","tree-structure","bi-modulus evolutionary algorithm","adaptive mutation module","solution-density approximation","covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy","particle swarm optimization","probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983172/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Continuous non-revisiting genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983172/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688767","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous non-revisiting genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp250-P321.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111478S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983172","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4983174,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Oshima","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Oshima","id":"38059469500"},{"name":"Atsushi Miyamae","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Atsushi","lastName":"Miyamae","id":"37304086600"},{"name":"Jun Sakuma","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Sakuma","id":"37089120208"},{"name":"Shigenobu Kobayashi","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigenobu","lastName":"Kobayashi","id":"37277813900"},{"name":"Isao Ono","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Isao","lastName":"Ono","id":"37280839200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2958-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2959-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4983174","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4983174","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to propose a new real-coded genetic algorithm (RCGA) named networked genetic algorithm (NGA) that intends to find multiple optima simultaneously in deceptive globally multimodal landscapes. Most current techniques such as niching for finding multiple optima take into account big valley landscapes or non-deceptive globally multimodal landscapes but not deceptive ones called UV-landscapes. Adaptive Neighboring Search (ANS) is a promising approach for finding multiple optima in UV-landscapes. ANS utilizes a restricted mating scheme with a crossover-like mutation in order to find optima in deceptive globally multimodal landscapes. However, ANS has a fundamental problem that it does not find all the optima simultaneously in many cases. NGA overcomes the problem by an adaptive parent-selection scheme and an improved crossover-like mutation. We show the effectiveness of NGA over ANS in terms of the number of detected optima in a single run on Fletcher and Powell functions as benchmark problems that are known to have UV-landscapes. We also analyze the behavior of NGA to confirm that the adaptive parent-selection scheme contributes the performance of NGA.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983174","startPage":"1912","endPage":"1919","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983174.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new real-coded genetic algorithm using the adaptive selection network for detecting multiple optima","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Adaptive systems","Nearest neighbor searches","Genetic mutations","Euclidean distance","Performance analysis","Evolutionary computation","Encoding","Clustering algorithms","Covariance matrix"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-coded genetic algorithm","adaptive selection network","multiple optima detection","networked genetic algorithm","deceptive globally multimodal landscapes","adaptive neighboring search","crossover-like mutation","Fletcher functions","Powell functions","UV-landscapes","adaptive parent-selection scheme"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983174/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A new real-coded genetic algorithm using the adaptive selection network for detecting multiple optima","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983174/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688769","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new real-coded genetic algorithm using the adaptive selection network for detecting multiple optima","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp252-P563.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055007S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983174","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4983175,"authors":[{"name":"G.S.

The numerical results, with 13 unconstrained multiobjective optimization testing instances and 10 constrained multiobjective optimization testing instances, are shown in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983176","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983176.pdf","startPage":"1928","endPage":"1934","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on determined weight and sub-regional search","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983176/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"The multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on determined weight and sub-regional search","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4983176/","accessionNumber":"10688771","publicationDate":"May 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on determined weight and sub-regional search","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp254-P715.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044504S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4983177,"authors":[{"name":"Santosh Tiwari","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Clemson University, SC, USA"],"firstName":"Santosh","lastName":"Tiwari","id":"37089091373"},{"name":"Georges Fadel","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Clemson University, SC, USA"],"firstName":"Georges","lastName":"Fadel","id":"38068964300"},{"name":"Patrick Koch","affiliation":["Dassault Systemes, Simulia Corporation, Cary, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Koch","id":"38196230900"},{"name":"Kalyanmoy Deb","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Kalyanmoy","lastName":"Deb","id":"37272206800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2958-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2959-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4983177","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":299},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4983177","abstract":"In this paper, the performance assessment of the hybrid Archive-based Micro Genetic Algorithm (AMGA) on a set of bound-constrained synthetic test problems is reported.

The gradient based optimizer is used for a fast local search and is a variant of the sequential quadratic programming method. The Matlab implementation of the SQP (provided by the fmincon optimization function) is used in this paper. The evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm AMGA is used as the global optimizer. A scalarization scheme based on the weighted objectives is proposed which is designed to facilitate the simultaneous improvement of all the objectives. The scalarization scheme proposed in this paper also utilizes reference points as constraints to enable the algorithm to solve non-convex optimization problems. The gradient based optimizer is used as the mutation operator of the evolutionary algorithm and a suitable scheme to switch between the genetic mutation and the gradient based mutation is proposed. The hybrid AMGA is designed to balance local versus global search strategies so as to obtain a set of diverse non-dominated solutions as quickly as possible. The simulation results of the hybrid AMGA are reported on the bound-constrained test problems described in the CEC09 benchmark suite.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983177","startPage":"1935","endPage":"1942","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983177.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance assessment of the hybrid Archive-based Micro Genetic Algorithm (AMGA) on the CEC09 test problems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Genetic mutations","System testing","Constraint optimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Encoding","Switches","Mechanical engineering","Writing","History"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed algorithms","genetic algorithms","gradient methods","performance evaluation","quadratic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance assessment","hybrid archive-based micro genetic algorithm","CEC09 test problems","bound-constrained synthetic test problems","gradient based single-objective optimization algorithm","evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm","gradient based optimizer","fast local search","sequential quadratic programming","global optimizer","scalarization scheme","nonconvex optimization problem","mutation operator","evolutionary algorithm","genetic mutation","gradient based mutation","global search strategy","bound-constrained test problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983177/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance assessment of the hybrid Archive-based Micro Genetic Algorithm (AMGA) on the CEC09 test problems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983177/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688772","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance assessment of the hybrid Archive-based Micro Genetic Algorithm (AMGA) on the CEC09 test problems","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp255-P719.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06682S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983177","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4983179,"authors":[{"name":"Lin-Yu Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Lin-Yu","lastName":"Tseng","id":"37410521500"},{"name":"Chun Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37696788600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2958-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2959-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4983179","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":616},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4983179","abstract":"Many real-world optimization problems involve multiple conflicting objectives.

These problems constitute a test suite provided for competition in the special session & competition on performance assessment of constrained/bound constrained multi-objective optimization algorithms in CEC 2009. In the multiple trajectory search, a set of uniformly distributed solutions is first generated. These solutions will be separated into foreground solutions and background solutions. The search is focuses mainly on foreground solutions and partly on background solutions. The MTS chooses and applies one of the three local search methods on solutions iteratively. The three local search methods begin their search in a very large ldquoneighborhoodrdquo. Then the neighborhood contracts step by step until it reaches a pre-defined tiny size, after then, it is reset to its original size. By utilizing such size-varied neighborhood searches, the MTS effectively solves the multi-objective optimization problems.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983179","startPage":"1951","endPage":"1958","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983179.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple trajectory search for unconstrained/constrained multi-objective optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Constraint optimization","Search methods","Testing","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Computer science","Evolutionary computation","Computational modeling","Electronic mail","Contracts","Sorting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constraint theory","optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple trajectory search","constrained multi-objective optimization","unconstrained multi-objective optimization","test suite","uniformly distributed solution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-objective optimization","multiple trajectory search","simulated orthogonal array","local search"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983179/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multiple trajectory search for unconstrained/constrained multi-objective optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983179/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688774","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple trajectory search for unconstrained/constrained multi-objective optimization","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp257-P708.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056693S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983179","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4983181,"authors":[{"name":"Adnan Acan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Eastern Mediterranean University, Mersin, Turkey"],"firstName":"Adnan","lastName":"Acan","id":"37282625500"},{"name":"Ahmet Unveren","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Eastern Mediterranean University, Mersin, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ahmet","lastName":"Unveren","id":"37564776800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2958-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2959-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4983181","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Constraint optimization","Knowledge engineering","Artificial immune systems","Testing","Birds","Marine animals","Educational institutions","Multiagent systems","Maintenance engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial immune systems","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memory based colonization","particle swarm optimization","externally implemented global memories","particle based memories","colonization approach","artificial immune system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4983181","abstract":"A novel memory-based particle swarm optimization algorithm employing externally implemented global (shared) and particle-based (local) memories and a colonization approach similar to artificial immune system algorithms is presented.

This way, a colony of new positions is obtained for each particle and the one with the best fitness is selected and put within the new swarm.

For more than two objectives there is a difficulty with the representation and visualization of the solutions in the objective space. Therefore, it is not clear for the decision maker the trade-off between the different alternative solutions. Thus, this creates enormous difficulties when choosing a solution from the Pareto-optimal set and constitutes a central question in the process of decision making. Based on a statistical method, Principal Component Analysis, the problem of reduction of the number of objectives is addressed. Several test examples with different number of objectives have been studied in order to evaluate the process of decision making through these methods. Preliminary results indicate that this statistical approach can be a valuable tool on decision making in multiobjective optimization.","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983187.pdf","startPage":"2008","endPage":"2015","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983187","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective optimization: Redundant and informative objectives","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective optimization: Redundant and informative objectives","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983187/","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4983187/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688782","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective optimization: Redundant and informative objectives","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp265-P452.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096934S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983187","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4983189,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The main goal of this work is to emphasise the potential benefits of this architecture for real system identification. Instead of working on the conventional bit by bit operation, both the crossover and mutation operators are real-valued. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated in comparison to a binary-coded GA in modelling the TRMS. A complete system identification procedure has been carried out, from experimental design to model validation using a laboratory-scale helicopter. In this case, the identified model is characterized by a fourth order linear ARMA structure which describes with very high precision the hovering motion of a TRMS. The TRMS can be perceived as a static test rig for an air vehicle with formidable control challenges. Therefore, an analysis of modeling of nonlinear aerodynamic function is needed and carried out in both time and frequency domains based on observed input and output data. Experimental results are obtained using a laboratory set-up system, confirming the viability and effectiveness of the proposed methodology.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983189","startPage":"2022","endPage":"2028","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983189.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-coded genetic algorithm for parametric modelling of a TRMS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983189/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Real-coded genetic algorithm for parametric modelling of a TRMS","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983189/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10688784","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-coded genetic algorithm for parametric modelling of a TRMS","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp267-P093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066715S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983189","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":4983191,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

This process transforms original representation space into a representation that highlights regularities. In this new improved space learning algorithms work more effectively, generating better solutions. Most CI methods apply a greedy strategy to improve representation space. Greedy methods might converge to local optima, when search space is complex. Genetic Algorithms (GA) as a global search strategy is more effective in such situations. In this paper, a real-coded GA (RGACI) model is represented for CI. This model optimizes the representation space by discretization of feature's values, constructing new features with a GA and evaluation and selection of features upon a PNN Classifier accuracy. Results reveal that PNN Classifier accuracy will improved considerably after it is integrated with RGACI model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983191/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10688786","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983191/","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A real-coded genetic algorithm for constructive induction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A real-coded genetic algorithm for constructive induction","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp269-P172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059957S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983191","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4983196,"authors":[{"name":"O.

For the former group, a novel concept of evolving elite group (EEG) is introduced, which consists of relatively superior particles in a population. The elite particles are evolved by mutation and selection scheme of EP. The other ordinary particles refer to the closest elite particle as well as the global best and the personal best, to update their location.

Although PSO is in general considered to be computationally efficient algorithm, its direct software implementation on complex problems, targeted on low capacity embedded processors could however suffer from poor execution performance. This paper first evaluates the performance of the standard PSO algorithm on a typical embedded platform (using a 16-bit microcontroller). Then, a modular, flexible and reusable architecture for a hardware PSO engine, for accelerating the algorithm's performance, will be presented. Finally, implementation test results of the proposed architecture targeted on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology will be presented and its performance compared against software executions on benchmark test functions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating the performance of particle swarm optimization for embedded applications","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983226","startPage":"2294","endPage":"2300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983226.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4983226","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983226/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating the performance of particle swarm optimization for embedded applications","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983226/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688821","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating the performance of particle swarm optimization for embedded applications","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp304-P564.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085412S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4983240,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Yan Sun","affiliation":["School of Information and Electrical Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiao Yan","lastName":"Sun","id":"37276409700"},{"name":"Dun Wei Gong","affiliation":["School of Information and Electrical Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Dun Wei","lastName":"Gong","id":"37269375200"},{"name":"Xiao Ping Ma","affiliation":["School of Information and Electrical Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiao Ping","lastName":"Ma","id":"37279527700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2958-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2959-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4983240","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4983240","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Fatigue","Algorithm design and analysis","Stochastic processes","Data mining","Cognition","Probability","Entropy","Sampling methods","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directed graphs","entropy","fuzzy set theory","genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","probability","regression analysis","sampling methods","stochastic processes","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directed fuzzy graph","surrogate model-assisted interactive genetic algorithm","stochastic fitness","user cognition","cut-set level","interval dominance probability","fuzzy entropy","data sampling","support vector regression machine training","fashion evolutionary design system"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983240","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983240.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","startPage":"2395","endPage":"2402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Directed fuzzy graph-based surrogate model-assisted interactive genetic algorithms with uncertain individual's fitness","abstract":"In order to alleviate user fatigue of interactive genetic algorithms with an individual's fuzzy and stochastic fitness, we propose a surrogate model-assisted algorithm by using a directed fuzzy graph to extract user cognition.

In the computer aided diagnosis system designed for kidney disease, glomerulus extraction is an important step for analyzing kidney-tissue image. Against the disadvantages of traditional methods, this paper proposes a glomerulus extraction method using genetic algorithm for edge patching. Firstly, Canny edge detector is applied to get discontinuous edges of glomerulus. After labeling to remove the noises, genetic algorithm is used to search for optimal patching segments to join those edges together. Lastly, the edges and the patching segments with high fitness would be able to form the whole edge of the glomerulus. Experiments and comparisons indicate the proposed method can extract the glomerulus from kidney-tissue image both fast and accurately.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983251","startPage":"2474","endPage":"2479","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983251.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Glomerulus extraction by using genetic algorithm for edge patching","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Image edge detection","Data mining","Detectors","Shape","Noise shaping","Production systems","Diseases","Image analysis","Labeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","feature extraction","filtering theory","genetic algorithms","image segmentation","kidney","medical image processing","patient diagnosis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["glomerulus extraction","kidney-tissue image","computer aided diagnosis system","Canny edge detection","optimal patching segment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983251/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Glomerulus extraction by using genetic algorithm for edge patching","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983251/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688846","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Glomerulus extraction by using genetic algorithm for edge patching","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp329-P228.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045857S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4983254,"authors":[{"name":"Ammar W.

When a new solution is to be generated by crossover and/or mutation for a cell, a pair of parent solutions is selected from its neighbors. The current solution at the cell is replaced with the newly generated offspring if the offspring has the higher fitness value than the current one. That is, the ldquoreplace-if-betterrdquo policy is used for the replacement of the current solution. Local selection, crossover, mutation and replacement are iterated at every cell in cellular algorithms. A recently proposed multiobjective evolutionary algorithm called MOEA/D by Zhang and Li (2007) can be viewed as a cellular algorithm where each cell has its own scalarizing fitness function with a different weight vector. We can introduce a spatial structure to MOEA/D by the Euclidean distance between weight vectors. Its main difference from standard cellular algorithms is that a newly generated offspring for a cell is compared with not only the current solution of the cell but also its neighbors for local replacement in MOEA/D. In this paper, we examine the effect of local replacement on the search ability of a cellular version of MOEA/D. Whereas the same neighborhood structure was used for local selection and local replacement in the original MOEA/D, we examine the use of different neighborhood structures for local selection and local replacement. It is shown through computational experiments on multiobjective 0/1 knapsack problems with two, four and six objectives that local replacement plays an important role in MOEA/D especially for many-objective optimization problems.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983256","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983256.pdf","startPage":"2508","endPage":"2515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of using two neighborhood structures on the performance of cellular evolutionary algorithms for many-objective optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4983256","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983256/","displayDocTitle":"Effects of using two neighborhood structures on the performance of cellular evolutionary algorithms for many-objective optimization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688851","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983256/","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of using two neighborhood structures on the performance of cellular evolutionary algorithms for many-objective optimization","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp334-P629.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071525S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983256","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4983262,"authors":[{"name":"Glauber R.

The second step is a multiobjective technique for the daily operation of generating units. The two objectives are to maximize the plant efficiency and to minimize the number of startups and shutdowns of generating units. Data from a Brazilian power plant were used in the simulation of a daily operation. A daily load curve contains 24 static problems, each one solved on average in approximately 2 minutes. The second step was executed in approximately 99 seconds. The proposed model proved suitable for the daily operation of the hydroelectric power plant studied, given the low computational time, satisfactory efficiency and low number of generating units startups and shutdowns (only 12).","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983262","startPage":"2554","endPage":"2560","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983262.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective dispatch of hydrogenerating units using a two-step genetic algorithm method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983262/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective dispatch of hydrogenerating units using a two-step genetic algorithm method","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983262/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10688857","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective dispatch of hydrogenerating units using a two-step genetic algorithm method","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp340-P174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056694S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983262","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4983271,"authors":[{"name":"Luigi Cardamone","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Luigi","lastName":"Cardamone","id":"37397119800"},{"name":"Daniele Loiacono","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Loiacono","id":"37303270800"},{"name":"Pier Luca Lanzi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Pier Luca","lastName":"Lanzi","id":"37352642300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2958-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2959-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4983271","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":483},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4983271","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Artificial intelligence","Learning","Computer simulation","Application software","Testing","Computational intelligence","Stochastic processes","Analytical models","Physics computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer games","Internet","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural net architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online neuroevolution","open racing car simulator","online learning technique","computer games","true adaptive game AI","offline learning scenario","online learning problem","nonplayer characters","The Open Car Racing Simulator","open source car racing simulator","online evolution"]}],"abstract":"The application of on-line learning techniques to modern computer games is a promising research direction. In fact, they can be used to improve the game experience and to achieve a true adaptive game AI. So far, several works proved that neuroevolution techniques can be successfully applied to modern computer games but they are usually restricted to offline learning scenarios. In on-line learning problems the main challenge is to find a good trade-off between the exploration, i.e., the search for better solutions, and the exploitation of the best solution discovered so far. In this paper we propose an on-line neuroevolution approach to evolve non-player characters in The Open Car Racing Simulator (TORCS), a state-of-the-art open source car racing simulator. We tested our approach on two on-line learning problems: (i) on-line evolution of a fast controller from scratch and (ii) optimization of an existing controller for a new track. Our results show that on-line neuroevolution can effectively improve the performance achieved during the learning process.","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983271.pdf","startPage":"2622","endPage":"2629","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983271","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-line neuroevolution applied to The Open Racing Car Simulator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983271/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"On-line neuroevolution applied to The Open Racing Car Simulator","htmlLink":"/document/4983271/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688866","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-line neuroevolution applied to The Open Racing Car Simulator","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp349-P469.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048065S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983271","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4983274,"authors":[{"name":"Alan Fitzgerald","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Southern Maine, Portland, ME, USA"],"firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Fitzgerald","id":"38057978200"},{"name":"Clare Bates Congdon","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Southern Maine, Portland, ME, USA"],"firstName":"Clare Bates","lastName":"Congdon","id":"37330313100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2958-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2959-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4983274","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Game theory","Evolutionary computation","Computational intelligence","Humans","Feature extraction","Computer science","USA Councils","Writing","Decision making"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer games","evolutionary computation","learning (artificial intelligence)","software agents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rule-based agent","Ms Pac-Man","evolutionary computation","hand-coded rule","artificial agent learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4983274","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983274.pdf","startPage":"2646","endPage":"2653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RAMP: A rule-based agent for Ms. Pac-Man","abstract":"RAMP is a rule-based agent for playing Ms. Pac-Man according to the rules stipulated in the 2008 World Congress on Computational Intelligence Ms. Pac-Man Competition.

Furthermore, we identify a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for GAs to eventually with probability 1 fail to find any globally optimal solution. Interestingly, both of these conditions are completely determined by the fitness function and multiplicative noise, and they are unaffected by the additive noise. Our analysis also shows that the chain converges to stationarity.

The Moving Peaks (MP) function is used as a benchmark. In our experiments, the algorithms performed almost identically well on the problem instances used. However, it was observed that the pattern move, an intrinsic part of the HJ algorithm, hardly contributed to the quality of the outcome, in fact less than the number sequence used as step sizes for both local searches. We provide some investigations into why the pattern move is less successful than most authors - including the original inventors of the Hooke-Jeeves search - seem to anticipate.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983277","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983277.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","startPage":"2670","endPage":"2676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hooke-Jeeves revisited","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4983277","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hooke-Jeeves revisited","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983277/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688872","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4983277/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hooke-Jeeves revisited","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp355-P319.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094127S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983277","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4983278,"authors":[{"name":"Tina Yu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada"],"firstName":"Tina","lastName":"Yu","id":"37692906800"},{"name":"Dave Wilkinson","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada"],"firstName":"Dave","lastName":"Wilkinson","id":"37281709100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2958-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2959-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4983278","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"abstract":"Reservoir modeling is an on-going activity during the production life of a reservoir.

The simulation results are also used to co-evolve the computer simulator proxies. We have developed a co-evolutionary system incorporating various techniques to conduct a case study. Although the system was able to select a very small number of reservoir samples to run the computer simulations and use the simulation data to construct simulator proxies with high accuracy, these proxy models do not generalize very well on a larger set of simulation data generated from our previous study. Nevertheless, we have identified that including a test-bank in the system helped mitigating the situation.

In this study, a new parameter referred to as the spread factor is introduced so as to speed up the PSO convergence. This factor continuously modifies the inertia weight of the PSO velocity equation during the search process by measuring the distribution of particles around the global best particle. Test results show that the spread factor enables the PSO to achieve a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Consequently, escape from local optima and fast convergence to global optima can be guaranteed. This is due to the ability of the algorithm to maintain the search momentum especially when some particles are trapped at local optima, and to expedite convergence once all particles are within the vicinity of the global optima. The test results presented here illustrate the improvement of this adaptive approach over methods using either fixed or linearly decreasing inertia weights.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983280","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983280.pdf","startPage":"2693","endPage":"2700","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast convergence strategy for Particle Swarm Optimization using spread factor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983280/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fast convergence strategy for Particle Swarm Optimization using spread factor","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688875","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4983280/","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast convergence strategy for Particle Swarm Optimization using spread factor","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp358-P426.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080807S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4983288,"authors":[{"name":"Hirotaka Kaji","affiliation":["Research and Development Section, Yamaha Motor Company Limited, Iwata, Shizuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hirotaka","lastName":"Kaji","id":"37698824500"},{"name":"Kokolo Ikeda","affiliation":["Academic Center of Computing and Media Studies, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Kokolo","lastName":"Ikeda","id":"38666390600"},{"name":"Hajime Kita","affiliation":["Academic Center of Computing and Media Studies, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Hajime","lastName":"Kita","id":"37087356007"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2958-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2959-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4983288","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4983288","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Constraint optimization","Diesel engines","Calibration","Evolutionary computation","Electric breakdown","Optimization methods","Uncertainty","Computational fluid dynamics","Cost function","Temperature"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constraint violation","experiment-based evolutionary multiobjective optimization","evolutionary algorithm","risky-constraint violation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983288","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983288.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","startPage":"2756","endPage":"2763","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983288","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Avoidance of constraint violation for experiment-based evolutionary multi-objective optimization","abstract":"Experiment-based optimization using Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) is a promising approach for real world problems in which construction of simulation models is difficult. When using EAs, three difficulties have to be considered. Currently, two difficulties, uncertainty of the evaluation value and limitation of the number of evaluations, are active research topics into EAs. However, the other difficulty, avoidance of extreme trial, has not entered into the spotlight. Extreme trials run the dasiariskpsila of breakdown of the optimized object and its measurement instruments in experiment-based optimization. In this paper, we consider that the extreme trial means a large constraint violation of the problems, and install the concept of dasiarisky-constraintpsila. Then, to avoid risky-constraint violation, we propose a violation avoidance method and combine it with Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed through numerical experiments and real common-rail diesel engine experiments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983288/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10688883","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983288/","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Avoidance of constraint violation for experiment-based evolutionary multi-objective optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Avoidance of constraint violation for experiment-based evolutionary multi-objective optimization","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp366-P389.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076532S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983288","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4983289,"authors":[{"name":"Jeff Clune","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Jeff","lastName":"Clune","id":"37706133600"},{"name":"Benjamin E.

Traditional evolutionary algorithms can produce these controllers, but require manual decomposition or other problem simplification because conventionally-used direct encodings have trouble taking advantage of a problem's regularities and symmetries. Such active intervention is time consuming, limits the range of potential solutions, and requires the user to possess a deep understanding of the problem's structure. This paper demonstrates that HyperNEAT, a new and promising generative encoding for evolving neural networks, can evolve quadruped gaits without an engineer manually decomposing the problem. Analyses suggest that HyperNEAT is successful because it employs a generative encoding that can more easily reuse phenotypic modules. It is also one of the first neuroevolutionary algorithms that exploits a problem's geometric symmetries, which may aid its performance. We compare HyperNEAT to FT-NEAT, a direct encoding control, and find that HyperNEAT is able to evolve impressive quadruped gaits and vastly outperforms FT-NEAT. Comparative analyses reveal that HyperNEAT individuals are more holistically affected by genetic operators, resulting in better leg coordination. Overall, the results suggest that HyperNEAT is a powerful algorithm for evolving control systems for complex, yet regular, devices, such as robots.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983289","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983289.pdf","startPage":"2764","endPage":"2771","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983289","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolving coordinated quadruped gaits with the HyperNEAT generative encoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Evolving coordinated quadruped gaits with the HyperNEAT generative encoding","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4983289/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688884","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983289/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolving coordinated quadruped gaits with the HyperNEAT generative encoding","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp367-P544.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110124S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4983302,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Lewis","affiliation":["Institute of Integrated and Intelligent Systems, Griffith University, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Lewis","id":"37265628100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2958-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2959-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4983302","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4983302","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Particle swarm optimization","Social network services","IEEE","Distance measurement","Equations","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Pareto optimisation","particle swarm optimisation","social networking (online)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective optimisation","spatial social network optimisation algorithm","LoCost","particle swarm optimisation","Pareto dominance","conventional MOPSO algorithm","Pareto-front"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983302","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983302.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","startPage":"2866","endPage":"2870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983302","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LoCost: A spatial social network algorithm for multi-objective optimisation","abstract":"Particle swarm optimisation (PSO) is increasingly being applied to optimisation of problems in engineering design and scientific investigation. While readily adapted to single-objective problems, its use on multi-objective problems is hampered by the difficulty of finding effective means of guiding the swarm in the presence of multiple, competing objectives. This paper suggests a novel approach to this problem, based on an extension of the concepts of spatial social networks using a model of the behaviour of locusts and crickets. Comparison is made between neighbouring particles based on Pareto dominance, and a corresponding repulsion between particles added to previously suggested attractive forces. Computational experiments demonstrate that the new, spatial, social network optimisation algorithm can provide results comparable to a conventional MOPSO algorithm, and improved coverage of the Pareto-front.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983302/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10688897","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983302/","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"LoCost: A spatial social network algorithm for multi-objective optimisation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LoCost: A spatial social network algorithm for multi-objective optimisation","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp380-P066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052142S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4983310,"authors":[{"name":"Karthik Sindhya","affiliation":["Department of Business Technology, Helsinki School of Economics, Helsinki, Finland","Department of Mathematical Information Technology, University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland"],"firstName":"Karthik","lastName":"Sindhya","id":"37692139300"},{"name":"Ankur Sinha","affiliation":["Department of Business Technology, Helsinki School of Economics, Helsinki, Finland"],"firstName":"Ankur","lastName":"Sinha","id":"37555963700"},{"name":"Kalyanmoy Deb","affiliation":["Department of Business Technology, Helsinki School of Economics, Helsinki, Finland","Department of Mechanical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, India"],"firstName":"Kalyanmoy","lastName":"Deb","id":"37272206800"},{"name":"Kaisa Miettinen","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Information Technology, University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland"],"firstName":"Kaisa","lastName":"Miettinen","id":"37546691200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2958-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2959-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4983310","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":42,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":543},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Constraint optimization","Testing","Evolutionary computation","Mathematical programming","Information technology","Decision making","Convergence","Stress","Pareto optimization","Fluctuations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","mathematical programming","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local search problem","evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm","unconstrained problem","mathematical programming"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4983310","abstract":"Evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms are commonly used to obtain a set of non-dominated solutions for over a decade.

In this paper, we examine the requirements from a range of distributed autonomous systems and then propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection architecture capable of online adaptation inspired by the vertebrate immune system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983328.pdf","startPage":"3045","endPage":"3051","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4983328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly detection inspired by immune network theory: A proposal","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proposals","Intrusion detection","Wireless sensor networks","Immune system","Robot sensing systems","Computerized monitoring","Computer science","Computer architecture","Computer networks","Computer security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","swarm robotics","wireless sensor networks","normal-model","distributed autonomous systems","unsupervised anomaly detection architecture","vertebrate immune system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983328/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly detection inspired by immune network theory: A proposal","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983328/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688923","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly detection inspired by immune network theory: A proposal","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp406-P446.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088434S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983328","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4983333,"authors":[{"name":"Satyasai Jagannath Nanda","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Satyasai Jagannath","lastName":"Nanda","id":"38192205000"},{"name":"Ganapati Panda","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Ganapati","lastName":"Panda","id":"37301237700"},{"name":"Babita Majhi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Babita","lastName":"Majhi","id":"37531131600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2958-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2959-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4983333","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Immune system","Artificial neural networks","Particle swarm optimization","Artificial immune systems","Convergence","Evolutionary computation","Diseases","Computational intelligence","Diversity reception","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial immune systems","neural nets","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["immunized PSO algorithm","Hammerstein model identification","artificial immune system","particle swarm optimization","artificial neural network","convergence speed"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial immune system","particle swarm optimization","immunized PSO","functional link artificial neural network","Hammerstein model","convergence speed"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4983333","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983333","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","abstract":"Combining the good features of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and artificial immune system (AIS) we propose a new Immunized PSO (IPSO) algorithm.

To solve the problems, a hybrid self-adaptive genetic algorithm based on sexual reproduction and Baldwin effect is presented for global optimization in this paper. By simulating sexual reproduction in nature, the proposed algorithm utilizes a gender determination method to determine the gender of individuals in population. Then, it adopts the different initial genetic parameters for female and male subgroups, and self-adaptively adjusts the sexual genetic operation based on the competition and cooperation between different gender subgroups. Furthermore, the fitness information transmission between parents and offspring is implemented to guide the evolution of individuals- acquired fitness. Moreover, on the basis of the Darwinian evolution theory, the proposed algorithm guides individuals to forward or reverse acquired reinforcement learning based on Baldwin effect in niche. Numerical simulations are conducted for a set of benchmark functions with different dimensional decision variables. The results show that the proposed algorithm can find optimal or closer-to-optimal solution, and has faster search speed and higher convergence rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983334/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10688929","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983334/","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A hybrid self-adaptive genetic algorithm based on sexual reproduction and baldwin effect for global optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid self-adaptive genetic algorithm based on sexual reproduction and baldwin effect for global optimization","confLoc":"Trondheim","sourcePdf":"rp412-P672.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101895S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4983340,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37406119800"},{"name":"Shengxiang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK"],"firstName":"Shengxiang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37279520600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2958-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2959-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"4983340","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":271},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Shortest path problem","Mobile ad hoc networks","Wireless sensor networks","Network topology","Artificial intelligence","Intelligent networks","Intelligent sensors","Artificial neural networks","Particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","genetic algorithms","mobile computing","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","elitism-based immigrants","shortest path problem","mobile ad hoc networks","intelligent optimization","wireless communications","network topology","dynamic optimization problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4983340","abstract":"In recent years, the static shortest path (SP) problem has been well addressed using intelligent optimization techniques, e.g., artificial neural networks (ANNs), genetic algorithms (GAs), particle swarm optimization (PSO), etc. However, with the advancement in wireless communications, more and more mobile wireless networks appear, e.g., mobile ad hoc network (MANET), wireless sensor network (WSN), etc. One of the most important characteristics in mobile wireless networks is the topology dynamics, that is, the network topology changes over time due to energy conservation or node mobility. Therefore, the SP problem turns out to be a dynamic optimization problem (DOP) in MANETs. In this paper, we propose to use elitism-based immigrants GA (EIGA) to solve the dynamic SP problem in MANETs. We consider MANETs as target systems because they represent new generation wireless networks. The experimental results show that the EIGA can quickly adapt to the environmental changes (i.e., the network topology change) and produce good solutions after each change.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983340","startPage":"3135","endPage":"3140","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983340.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithms with elitism-based immigrants for dynamic shortest path problem in mobile ad hoc networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983340/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithms with elitism-based immigrants for dynamic shortest path problem in mobile ad hoc networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983340/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10688935","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithms with elitism-based immigrants for dynamic shortest path problem in mobile ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp418-P723.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073956S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4983342,"authors":[{"name":"Sultan Noman Qasem","affiliation":["Soft Computing Research Group Faculty of Computer Science and Information System, University Technology of Malaysia, Skudai, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Sultan Noman","lastName":"Qasem","id":"37568762200"},{"name":"Siti Mariyam Hj.

Hence, it is useful to split the optimization process of hidden layer and output layer of the network accordingly. This study proposes hybrid learning of RBF Network with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for better convergence, error rates and classification results. The hybrid learning of RBF Network involves two phases. The first phase is a structure identification, in which unsupervised learning is exploited to determine the RBF centers and widths. This is done by executing different algorithms such as k-mean clustering and standard derivation respectively. The second phase is parameters estimation, in which supervised learning is implemented to establish the connections weights between the hidden layer and the output layer. This is done by performing different algorithms such as Least Mean Squares (LMS) and gradient based methods. The incorporation of PSO in hybrid learning of RBF Network is accomplished by optimizing the centers, the widths and the weights of RBF Network. The results for training, testing and validation of five datasets (XOR, Balloon, Cancer, Iris and Ionosphere) illustrate the effectiveness of PSO in enhancing RBF Network learning compared to conventional Backpropogation.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983342","startPage":"3149","endPage":"3156","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983342.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving performance of radial basis function network based with particle swarm optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radial basis function networks","Particle swarm optimization","Clustering algorithms","Convergence","Error analysis","Unsupervised learning","Parameter estimation","Supervised learning","Least squares approximation","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence of numerical methods","error statistics","gradient methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","least mean squares methods","particle swarm optimisation","pattern classification","pattern clustering","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radial basis function network","particle swarm optimization","hybrid learning","error rate","convergence","unsupervised learning","k-mean clustering","standard derivation","parameter estimation","least mean square method","gradient based method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["component","Hybrid learning","Radial basis function network","K-means","Least mean squares","Backpropogation","Particle swarm optimization","Unsupervised and supervised learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983342/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Improving performance of radial basis function network based with particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983342/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688937","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving performance of radial basis function network based with particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp420-P676.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.157236S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983342","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4983347,"authors":[{"name":"S.

We use measures from information theory and neuroscience to reward neurons in a neural network based on their degree of participation in the behavior of the network as a whole. In particular, we actively seek networks with high complexity and little redundancy, and argue that this can lead to efficient evolution of robust controllers.

Unfortunately, BBPSO may also get stuck into local optima when optimizing functions with many local optima in high dimensional search space. In previous attempts an approach was developed which consists of a jump strategy combined with PSO in order to escape from local optima and promising results have been obtained. In this paper, we combine BBPSO with a jump strategy when no fitness improvement is observed. The jump strategy is implemented based on the Gaussian or the Cauchy probability distribution. The algorithm was tested on a suite of well-known benchmark multimodal functions and the results were compared with those obtained by the standard BBPSO algorithm and with BBPSO with re-initialization. Simulation results show that the BBPSO with the jump strategy performs well in all functions investigated. We also notice that the improved performance is due to a successful number of Gaussian or Cauchy jumps.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983361/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688646","htmlLink":"/document/4983361/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Bare Bones Particle Swarm Optimization with Gaussian or Cauchy jumps","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bare Bones Particle Swarm Optimization with Gaussian or Cauchy jumps","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp439-P142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097831S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983361","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":4983362,"authors":[{"name":"Frederico G.

In the computation of the HCC, the samples in the estimate set are sequentially grouped into clusters. The nearest clusters in a given iteration are joined together until all the data is grouped in only one class. The distances of fusion used at each iteration of the hierarchical agglomerative clustering process are integrated into one value, which is the value of the HCC for that estimate set. The examples show that the HCC metric is able to evaluate both the extension and uniformity of the samples in the estimate set, making it suitable as a unary diversity metric for multiobjective optimization.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2009.4983362","startPage":"3292","endPage":"3299","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2009.4983362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982922","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939002/4982922/04983362.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A quality metric for multi-objective optimization based on Hierarchical Clustering Techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4983362/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A quality metric for multi-objective optimization based on Hierarchical Clustering Techniques","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4983362/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10688647","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A quality metric for multi-objective optimization based on Hierarchical Clustering Techniques","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"rp440-P656.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069249S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939002","isNumber":"4982922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939002","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4982922","articleId":"4983362","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4983365,"authors":[{"name":"M.
