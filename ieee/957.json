To predict the energy of solar radiation for 24 hours in advance, the so-called \u201ctime window\u201d method was used. To predict the intensity of solar radiation, measurements of hydro meteorological station were used. During simulation, the width of the input \u201ctime window\u201d was set to 24 hours, the width of the output \u201ctime window\u201d was set to 1 hours. Thus, the \u201ctime window\u201d was shifted 24 times.

While the conventional SRAM-based TCAM is high speed and bulky, there have been denser but slower and less reliable nonvolatile TCAMs using nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices. Meanwhile, some CMOS TCAMs using dynamic memories have been also proposed. Although dynamic TCAM could be denser than the 16T SRAM TCAM and more reliable than the nonvolatile TCAMs, CMOS dynamic TCAMs still suffer from the row-by-row refresh energy and time overheads. In this article, we propose dynamic TCAM using nanoelectromechanical (NEM) relays (DyTAN), and utilize one-shot refresh (OSR) to solve the memory refresh problem. By exploiting the unique NEM relay characteristics, DyTAN outperforms the existing works in the balance between density, speed, and power efficiency. Compared with the 16T SRAM-based TCAM, the 5T CMOS dynamic TCAM, the 2T2R TCAM, and the 2FeFET TCAM, evaluations show that the proposed DyTAN reduces the write energy by up to \n<inline-formula

order outputs must be launched in order to deliver the most value to the customer and the business. Therefore, a well-established process to discover and prioritize the content of the product roadmap in the right way is crucial for the success of a company. However, most companies prioritize their product roadmap items based on opinions of experts or the management. Additionally, increasing market dynamics, rapidly evolving technologies and fast changing customer behavior complicate the conduction of the prioritization process. Therefore, many companies are struggling to finding and establishing suitable techniques for prioritizing their product roadmap. Objective: In order to gain a better understanding of the prioritization process in a dynamic and uncertain market environment, this paper aims to identify suitable techniques for the prioritization in such environments. Method: We conducted a Grey Literature Review according to the guidelines of Garousi et al. Results: 18 techniques for the prioritization of the product roadmap could be identified. 15 techniques are primarily used to prioritize outputs by considering factors such as the expected impact or effort. Two technique are most suitable for prioritizing risky assumptions that need to be validated and one technique focuses on the prioritization of outcomes. All techniques have in common that they should be conducted as cross-functional team activity in order to include different perspectives in the prioritization process.","doi":"10.1109/ICE/ITMC52061.2021.9570243","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation (ICE/ITMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation (ICE/ITMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9570112/9570113/09570243.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICE/ITMC52061.2021.9570243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9570113","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How to Prioritize Your Product Roadmap When Everything Feels Important: A Grey Literature Review","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9570243","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"How to Prioritize Your Product Roadmap When Everything Feels Important: A Grey Literature Review","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 June 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9570243/","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"21 June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9570243/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How to Prioritize Your Product Roadmap When Everything Feels Important: A Grey Literature Review","confLoc":"Cardiff, United Kingdom","sourcePdf":"ICE2021Trieflinger_-_221_a.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095595S","chronDate":"21-23 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9570112","isNumber":"9570113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9570112","xplore-issue":"9570113","articleId":"9570243","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":9570248,"authors":[{"name":"Yvonne Voigt","affiliation":["Business Development, ioki GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany"],"firstName":"Yvonne","lastName":"Voigt","id":"37089006127"},{"name":"Stefan Trieflinger","affiliation":["Reutlingen University, Reutlingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Trieflinger","id":"37086943347"},{"name":"J\u00fcrgen M\u00fcnch","affiliation":["Reutlingen University, Reutlingen, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"M\u00fcnch","id":"37282482400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4963-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4964-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2693-8855"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2334-315X"}],"articleNumber":"9570248","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"abstract":"Context: The New Mobility industry is a young market that includes high market dynamics and is therefore associated with a high degree of uncertainty. Traditional product roadmapping approaches such a detailed planning of features over a long-time horizon typically fail in such environments. For this reason, companies that are active in the field of New Mobility are faced with the challenge of keeping their product roadmaps reliable for stakeholders while at the same time being able to react flexibly to changing market requirements. Objective: The goal of this paper is to identify the state of practice regarding product roadmapping of New Mobility companies. In addition, the related challenges within the product roadmapping process as well as the success factors to overcome these challenges will be highlighted. Method: We conducted semi-structured expert interviews with 8 experts (7 German company and one Finnish company) from the field of New Mobility and performed a content analysis. Results: Overall the results of the study showed that the participating companies are aware of the requirements that the New Mobility sector entails. Therefore, they exhibit a high level of maturity in terms of product roadmapping. Nevertheless, some aspects were revealed that pose specific challenges for the participating companies. One major challenge, for example, is that New Mobility in terms of public clients is often a tender business with non-negotiable product requirements. Thus, the product roadmap can be significantly influenced from the outside. As factors for a successful product roadmapping mainly soft factors such as trust between all people involved in the product development process and transparency throughout the entire roadmapping process were mentioned.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation (ICE/ITMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9570112/9570113/09570248.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation (ICE/ITMC)","doi":"10.1109/ICE/ITMC52061.2021.9570248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICE/ITMC52061.2021.9570248","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9570113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9570248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Product Roadmaps in the New Mobility Domain: State of the Practice and Industrial Experiences","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Industries","Technological innovation","Uncertainty","Companies","Product development","Planning","Stakeholders"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["product management","product strategy","product roadmap","UX design","agile","lean","automotive","New Mobility"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9570248/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 June 2021","displayDocTitle":"Product Roadmaps in the New Mobility Domain: State of the Practice and Industrial Experiences","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9570248/","publicationDate":"21 June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2021","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Product Roadmaps in the New Mobility Domain: State of the Practice and Industrial Experiences","confLoc":"Cardiff, United Kingdom","sourcePdf":"ICE2021Voigt_-_247_a.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05042S","chronDate":"21-23 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9570112","isNumber":"9570113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9570112","xplore-issue":"9570113","articleId":"9570248","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":9570276,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Schulte","affiliation":["Institute for Communications Engineering, Technical University of Munich (TUM), Munich, Germany","Huawei Munich Research Center, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Patrick Schulte (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Dr.-Ing. degrees in electrical engineering from the Technical University of Munich, Germany, in 2012, 2014, and 2020, respectively.

The additional requirement of invertibility usually leads to using encoders that are one-to-one mappings, also known as distribution matchers. However, even the best one-to-one encoders have divergences that grow logarithmically with the block length. To overcome this limitation, an encoder is proposed that has an invertible one-to-many mapping and a low-rate random number generator (RNG). Two algorithms are developed to design the mapping by assigning strings in either a most-likely first or least-likely first order. Both algorithms give information rates approaching the entropy of the target distribution with exponentially decreasing divergence and with vanishing RNG rate in the block length.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9570276/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","volume":"68","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9570276/","displayDocTitle":"Invertible Low-Divergence Coding","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001659","fundingName":"German Research Foundation (DFG)","grantNumber":"KR 3517/9-1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Invertible Low-Divergence Coding","sourcePdf":"tit-schulte-3120066-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141077S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9660615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9660615","articleId":"9570276","onlineDate":"14 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":9570282,"authors":[{"name":"Ramy A.

In this study, we propose an automatic, fast, and accurate deformable method, called iRegNet, for registering pre-operative magnetic resonance images to intra-operative ultrasound volumes to compensate for brain-shift. iRegNet is a robust end-to-end deep learning approach for the non-linear registration of MRI-iUS images in the context of image-guided neurosurgery. Pre-operative MRI (as moving image) and iUS (as fixed image) are first appended to our convolutional neural network, after which a non-rigid transformation field is estimated. The MRI image is then transformed using the output displacement field to the iUS coordinate system. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two multi-location databases, which are the BITE and the RESECT. Quantitatively, iRegNet reduced the mean landmark errors from pre-registration value of (4.18 \u00b1 1.84 and 5.35 \u00b1 4.19 mm) to the lowest value of (1.47 \u00b1 0.61 and 0.84 \u00b1 0.16 mm) for the BITE and RESECT datasets, respectively. Additional qualitative validation of this study was conducted by two expert neurosurgeons through overlaying MRI-iUS pairs before and after the deformable registration. Experimental findings show that our proposed iRegNet is fast and achieves state-of-the-art accuracies outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

The second is the performance improvement of those from the first construction of half-rate cases using a proposed weight matrix so that the result becomes type-II QC-LDPC codes.

Beamforming Optimization in Multi-Relay Assisted MIMO Over-the-Air Computation for Multi-Modal Sensing Data Aggregation","abstract":"In this letter, we investigate a multi-relay assisted over-the-air computation network for multi-modal sensing with direct links, where each node is equipped with multiple antennas and all the relays are operated in an amplify-and-forward mode. Specifically, the whole transmission is divided into two phases and all the sensors transmit symbols during both two phases. In particular, we are interested in minimizing the computation distortion measured by the mean-squared error (MSE) via jointly optimizing beamforming matrices at all nodes, subject to individual power constraints at the sensors and relays. The major difficulty lies in the strong coupling of beamforming matrices in the objective function and the non-convex transmit power constraints at the relays. To tackle this problem, a low-complexity locally optimal method based on alternating optimization is proposed, where closed-form expressions are obtained in each iteration. Furthermore, simulation results show that our proposed beamforming design can substantially enhance the computation MSE performance, as compared to other benchmark schemes.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9570302","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9644612/09570302.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9644612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3120182","startPage":"3937","endPage":"3941","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3120182","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9570302/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Joint Beamforming Optimization in Multi-Relay Assisted MIMO Over-the-Air Computation for Multi-Modal Sensing Data Aggregation","isDynamicHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9570302/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","isJournal":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2019B010119001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62101141 and 62102096"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2020M682612 and 2021M690738"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100021171","fundingName":"Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2020A1515110395"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Plan Project of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2020A050515010 and 2021A0505030015"},{"fundingName":"Special Support Plan for High-Level Talents of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2019TQ05X409"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Beamforming Optimization in Multi-Relay Assisted MIMO Over-the-Air Computation for Multi-Modal Sensing Data Aggregation","sourcePdf":"lcomm-li-3120182-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053475S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9644612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9644612","articleId":"9570302","onlineDate":"14 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":9570303,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Liao","affiliation":["Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9681827/9570303/liao-3120274-small.gif","p":["Yun Liao (Student Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2015.

The proposed method provides a novel technique for polar-code construction that no longer depends on sorting and selecting bit-channels by reliability, as in most current algorithms. Instead, this technique decides whether the input bits should be frozen in a purely sequential manner. The equivalence of optimizing the polar-code construction for the SCL decoder under this technique and maximizing the expected reward of traversing a maze is drawn. Simulation results show that the standard polar-code constructions that are designed for the successive-cancellation decoder are no longer optimal for the SCL decoder with respect to the frame error rate (FER). In contrast, the proposed game-based construction method finds code constructions that have similar or lower FER for various code lengths and various list sizes of the SCL decoder, compared to the state-of-the-art construction methods. The advantage of the game-based constructions over the standard constructions increases with the channel signal-to-noise ratio and the list size of SCL decoding. Moreover, the learning is highly efficient in terms of the number of required training samples and computational operations.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3120274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3120274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","startPage":"185","endPage":"198","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09570303.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9570303","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Polar codes","Codes","Reliability","Standards","Games","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Polar-code design","successive-cancellation list decoding","reinforcement learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Construction of Polar Codes With Reinforcement Learning","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"70","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9570303/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9570303/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"ONR","grantNumber":"N00014-18-1-2191"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"a Postdoctoral Fellowship from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), by Huawei, and by the Kailath Wang Fellowship from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Construction of Polar Codes With Reinforcement Learning","sourcePdf":"tcomm-liao-3120274-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0869S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9570303","onlineDate":"14 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9570309,"authors":[{"name":"Toloo Analooei","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Toloo","lastName":"Analooei","orcid":"0000-0002-7912-289X"},{"name":"S.

First, by utilizing the waveform characteristics of the NC signal, the proposed algorithm can enlarge the virtual array aperture that is twice the length of the physical array, and resultantly enhance DOA estimation accuracy. Moreover, by multiplying a correction matrix, the proposed algorithm can offset the NC phase error, thereby obtain further improved DOA estimation performance. Furthermore, the advocated algorithm can reduce the computation complexity by using the Newton-Raphson method instead of the traditional grid-search method. Finally, the numerical simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3120211","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9644612/09570330.pdf","startPage":"3843","endPage":"3847","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9644612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3120211","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9570330","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9570330/","displayDocTitle":"DOA Estimation of Non-Circular Source for Large Uniform Linear Array With a Single Snapshot: Extended DFT Method","volume":"25","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9570330/","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"China NSF","grantNumber":"61631020, 61971217 and 61971218"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Jiangsu NSF","grantNumber":"BK20200444"},{"fundingName":"Sonar technology key laboratory (Research on the theory and algorithm of signal processing for two-dimensional underwater acoustics coprime array) and the fund of Sonar technology key laboratory (Range estimation and location technology of passive target via multiple array combination), Jiangsu Key Research and Developement Project (BE2020101), Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"KYCX21_0215"},{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Project","grantNumber":"2020YFB1807602"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DOA Estimation of Non-Circular Source for Large Uniform Linear Array With a Single Snapshot: Extended DFT Method","sourcePdf":"lcomm-zhang-3120211-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054619S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9644612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9644612","articleId":"9570330","onlineDate":"14 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":9570332,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Xu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9570332/xu-3120097-small.gif","p":["Lei Xu received the B.S. degree from Huaibei Normal University, in 2006, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Anhui University, in 2009 and 2012, respectively.

This problem leads to the serious loss of achievable rate and offsets the performance gain caused by bandwidth increase, so a broadband hybrid precoding scheme based on cyclic delay is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a broadband hybrid precoding framework based on cyclic delay is constructed. A delay element is placed at each antenna of the traditional full-connected hybrid precoding structure. Thus, a frequency-dependent phase shift is accomplished to compensate the beam diffusion. Then, the unit delay of delay element at each antenna is determined by maximizing the array gain of the sub-carriers, but there is a problem that the unit delay is not uniform. Finally, through the design of analog precoding, the unity of the unit delay can be realized, while maximizing the array gain of each sub-carrier. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve 100% array gain at any sub-carrier, and is suitable for solving the problem of beam diffusion under different bandwidth and different number of transmit antennas. Compared with the existing schemes, the achievable rate of the proposed scheme is very close to that of the full-digital precoding scheme, and has the advantage of high energy efficiency.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3120097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","startPage":"141360","endPage":"141366","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09570332.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadband Hybrid Precoding Scheme Based on Cyclic Delay in Terahertz Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9570332/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9570332/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Broadband Hybrid Precoding Scheme Based on Cyclic Delay in Terahertz Communications","publicationDate":"2021","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62001001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Broadband Hybrid Precoding Scheme Based on Cyclic Delay in Terahertz Communications","sourcePdf":"access-xu-3120097-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100368S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9570332","onlineDate":"14 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":9570335,"authors":[{"name":"Tripti Singh","affiliation":["Symbiosis Centre of Applied Artificial Intelligence, Symbiosis Institute of Technology, Symbiosis International (Deemed University), Pune, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9570335/singh-3120098-small.gif","p":["Tripti Singh is currently pursuing the B.Tech. degree from the Information Technology Department, Symbiosis Institute of Technology, Symbiosis International University, Pune.

It includes sophisticated applications such as malpractice detection in the examination, distracted driving, gesture detection, etc., and requires robust and reliable pose estimation techniques. These applications help to map the attention of the user with head pose estimation (HPE) metrics supported by emotion and gaze analysis. This paper solves the problem of attention score estimation with HPE. The proposed method ensures ease of implementation while addressing head pose estimation using 68 facial features. Further, to attain reliability and precision, head pose estimation has been implemented as a regression task. The coordinate pair angle method (CPAM) with deep neural network (DNN) regression and elastic net regression is carried out. The use of DNN ensures precision on low lighting, distorted or occluded images. CPAM methodology leverages facial landmark detection and angular difference to estimate head pose. Experimentation results showed that the proposed model could handle large datasets, real-time data processing, significant pose variations, partial occlusions, and diverse facial expressions with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3\u00b0 and less. The proposed system was evaluated on three standard databases: the 300W across large poses (300W-LP) dataset, annotated facial landmarks in the wild (AFLW2000) dataset, and the national institute of mental health child emotional faces picture set (NIMH\n<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-</b>\nChEFS\n<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">)</b>\n dataset. The results achieved are on par with recent state-of-the-art methodologies such as anisotropic angle distribution learning (AADL), joint head pose estimation and face alignment algorithm (JFA), rotation axis focused attention network (RAFA-Net), and propose an MAE ranging up to 6\u00b0. The paper could achieve remarkable results for attention span prediction using head pose estimation and for many possible future applications.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3120098","startPage":"142632","endPage":"142643","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09570335.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3120098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Attention Span Prediction Using Head-Pose Estimation With Deep Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Head","Pose estimation","Faces","Three-dimensional displays","Magnetic heads","Convolutional neural networks","Training"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Head pose estimation","CPAM","convolutional neural network","regression","attention span prediction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9570335/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Attention Span Prediction Using Head-Pose Estimation With Deep Neural Networks","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9570335/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Symbiosis Centre of Applied Artificial Intelligence (SCAAI)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100019890","fundingName":"Centre for Advanced Modelling and Geospatial Information Systems (CAMGIS), Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology Sydney, Australia"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002383","fundingName":"Researchers Supporting Project through King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","grantNumber":"RSP-2021/14"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Attention Span Prediction Using Head-Pose Estimation With Deep Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"access-gite-3120098-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13401S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9570335","onlineDate":"14 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9570343,"authors":[{"name":"Shun Watanabe","affiliation":["Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Shun Watanabe (Senior Member, IEEE) received the B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees from the Tokyo Institute of Technology in 2005, 2007, and 2009, respectively.

Our converse is built upon the so-called partial channel resolvability approach; however, the minimax argument enables us to circumvent a flaw reported in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2021.3120033","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"25","endPage":"34","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3120033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9660615","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/9660615/09570343.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Codes","Error probability","Testing","Channel coding","Capacity planning","Information rates","Channel capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel resolvability","general formula identification code","information spectrum","minimax","second-order rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Minimax Converse for Identification via Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9570343/","volume":"68","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9570343/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI","grantNumber":"20H02144"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Minimax Converse for Identification via Channels","sourcePdf":"tit-watanabe-3120033-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076568S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9660615","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9660615","articleId":"9570343","onlineDate":"14 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":9570349,"authors":[{"name":"Berk Bozkurt","affiliation":["Bilkent University, Ankara, Bilkent, Turkey"],"firstName":"Berk","lastName":"Bozkurt","orcid":"0000-0002-5282-5843"},{"name":"Ahmet Dundar Sezer","affiliation":["University of California at Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmet Dundar","lastName":"Sezer","orcid":"0000-0001-6016-593X"},{"name":"Sinan Gezici","affiliation":["Bilkent University, Ankara, Bilkent, Turkey"],"firstName":"Sinan","lastName":"Gezici","orcid":"0000-0002-6369-3081"},{"name":"Tolga Girici","affiliation":["TOBB University of Economics and Technology, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Tolga","lastName":"Girici","orcid":"0000-0002-5705-4806"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9570349","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":45},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Game Theoretic Approach to Channel Switching in the Presence of Jamming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Jamming","Receivers","Games","Radio transmitters","Nash equilibrium","Optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel switching","jamming","Nash equilibrium","capacity","time-sharing","power allocation"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, a channel switching problem is investigated in the presence of jamming based on a game theoretic approach.

Being of full support-rank is a technical, yet natural condition required to prove a converse result for a capacity expression and satisfied by almost all currently known capacity-achieving schemes, while strong linearity is a practical requirement enabling implementation over small finite fields with low subpacketization degree. Then, the capacity of MDS-coded, linear, full support-rank PIR in the presence of colluding servers is derived, as well as the capacity of symmetric, linear PIR with colluding, adversarial, and nonresponsive servers for the recently introduced concept of matched randomness.

In this work, we propose an uplink-aided downlink channel acquisition framework using deep learning to reduce such overhead. We consider the entire downlink CSI acquisition process, including the downlink pilot design, channel estimation, and feedback. First, we propose an adaptive pilot design module by exploiting the correlation in magnitude among bidirectional channels in the angular domain to improve channel estimation. Second, to avoid the bit allocation problem during the feedback module, we concatenate the complex channel and embed the uplink channel magnitude to the channel reconstruction at the base station. Finally, we combine the two modules and compare two popular uplink-aided downlink channel acquisition frameworks. One framework estimates and subsequently feeds back the channel at the user equipment. In the other framework, the user equipment directly feeds back the received pilot signals to the base station. Results reveal that with the help of the uplink channel, directly feeding back pilot signals can save approximately 20% of feedback bits. This work thus provides a guideline for future research.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9570376/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","volume":"70","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9570376/","displayDocTitle":"CAnet: Uplink-Aided Downlink Channel Acquisition in FDD Massive MIMO Using Deep Learning","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFA0701602"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) for Distinguished Young Scholars","grantNumber":"61625106"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61941104"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008081","fundingName":"Scientific Research Foundation of Graduate School of Southeast University","grantNumber":"YBPY2118"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan","grantNumber":"110-2224-E-110-001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CAnet: Uplink-Aided Downlink Channel Acquisition in FDD Massive MIMO Using Deep Learning","sourcePdf":"tcomm-guo-3120294-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118595S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9570376","onlineDate":"14 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9570380,"authors":[{"name":"Suraj Verma","affiliation":["School of Computing, Engineering & Digital Technologies, Teesside University, Middlesbrough, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9570380/verma-3120199-small.gif","p":["Suraj Verma received the bachelor\u2019s degree in computer engineering from Kathmandu Engineering College, Kathmandu, Nepal, in 2014.

This disease has become an epidemic with several outbreaks in many Asian-Pacific countries with the basic reproduction number \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$R_{0} &gt; 1$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n. HFMD\u2019s diagnosis is very challenging as its lesion pattern may appear quite similar to other skin diseases such as herpangina, aseptic meningitis, and poliomyelitis. Therefore, clinical symptoms are essential besides skin lesion\u2019s pattern and position for precise diagnose of this disease. A deep learning-based HFMD detection system can play a significant role in the digital diagnosis of this disease. Various machine learning and deep learning architectures have been proposed for skin disease diagnosis and classification. However, these models are limited to the image classification problem. The diagnosis of similar appearing skin diseases using the image classification approach may result in misclassification or misdiagnosis of the disease. Parallel integration of clinical symptoms and images can improve disease diagnosis and classification performance. However, no deep learning architecture has been developed to diagnose HFMD disease from images and clinical data. This paper has proposed a novel Hybrid Deep Neural Networks integrating Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network and Convolutional Neural Network into a single framework for the diagnosis of HFMD using the integrated features from clinical and image data. The proposed Hybrid Deep Neural Networks is particularly a multi branched model comprising of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network in the first branch to extract the clinical features and the modified pre-trained CNN architecture: MobileNet or NasNetMobile in the second branch to extract the features from skin disease lesion images. The features learnt from both the branches are merged to form an integrated feature from clinical data and images, which is fed to the subsequent classification network. We conducted several experiments employing image data only, clinical data only and both sources of data. The analyses compared and evaluated the performance of a typical MLP model and CNN model with our proposed Hybrid Deep Neural Networks. The novel approach promotes the existing image classification model and clinical symptoms based disease classification model, particularly the MLP model. From the cross-validated experiments, the results reveal that the proposed Hybrid Deep Neural Networks can diagnose the disease 99%-100% accurately.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9570380/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9570380/","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Digital Diagnosis of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease Using Hybrid Deep Neural Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010897","fundingName":"Institutional Links, British Council, through the Newton Fund","grantNumber":"527643161"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004704","fundingName":"National Research Council of Thailand"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Digital Diagnosis of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease Using Hybrid Deep Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"access-razzaque-3120199-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081943S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9570380","onlineDate":"14 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9570384,"authors":[{"name":"Yin Liang","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, College of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Artificial Intelligence Institute, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yin","lastName":"Liang","orcid":"0000-0002-0067-0915","id":"37087472259"},{"name":"Baolin Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China","State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems, National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Baolin","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0002-0657-9207","id":"37089007728"},{"name":"Hesheng Zhang","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, College of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Artificial Intelligence Institute, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hesheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088982478"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1534-4320"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0210"}],"articleNumber":"9570384","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prototypes","Brain modeling","Convolutional neural networks","Feature extraction","Functional magnetic resonance imaging","Data models","Biological system modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Brain functional network classification","convolutional neural network","prototype learning","transfer learning","autism spectrum disorder","functional magnetic resonance imaging"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Autism Spectrum Disorder","Brain","Brain Mapping","Humans","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Neural Networks, Computer"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9570384","abstract":"The application of deep learning methods in brain disease diagnosis is becoming a new research hotspot. This study constructed brain functional networks based on the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, and proposed a novel convolutional neural network combined with a prototype learning (CNNPL) framework to classify brain functional networks for the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). At the bottom of CNNPL, traditional CNN was employed as the basic feature extractor, while at the top of CNNPL multiple prototypes were automatically learnt on the features to represent different categories. A generalized prototype loss based on distance cross-entropy was proposed to jointly learn the parameters of the CNN feature extractor and the prototypes. The classification was implemented with prototype matching. A transfer learning strategy was introduced to our CNNPL for weight initialization in the subsequent fine-tuning phase to promote model training. We conducted systematic experiments on the aggregate multi-sites ASD dataset. Experimental results revealed that our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in ASD classification and can reliably learn inter-site biomarkers, indicating the robustness of our model on large-scale dataset with inter-site variability. Furthermore, our model demonstrated robust learning capability for high-level organization of brain functionality. Our study also identified important brain regions as biomarkers associated with ASD classification. Together, our proposed model provides a promising solution for learning and classifying brain functional networks, and thus contributes to the biomarker extraction and imaging diagnosis of ASD.","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2021.3120024","startPage":"2193","endPage":"2202","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2021.3120024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9363468","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7333/9363468/09570384.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Convolutional Neural Network Combined With Prototype Learning Framework for Brain Functional Network Classification of Autism Spectrum Disorder","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9570384/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Convolutional Neural Network Combined With Prototype Learning Framework for Brain Functional Network Classification of Autism Spectrum Disorder","volume":"29","htmlLink":"/document/9570384/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"pubMedId":"34648452","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4204089"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61906006 and U1736219"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB0204304"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China","grantNumber":"FRF-MP-19-007"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Convolutional Neural Network Combined With Prototype Learning Framework for Brain Functional Network Classification of Autism Spectrum Disorder","sourcePdf":"tnsre-liang-3120024-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114535S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"9363468","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","xplore-issue":"9363468","articleId":"9570384","onlineDate":"14 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9570391,"authors":[{"name":"Yanjun Han","affiliation":["Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA","Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Yanjun Han (Member, IEEE) received the B.Eng. degree (Hons.) in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2015, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Stanford University in 2017 and 2021, respectively.

But it suffers voltage unbalance problem leading to reliability concerns. To avoid the direct series-connection, this paper presents an alternative solution for two series-connected SiC MOSFETs: quasi-two-level(Q2L) modulation based on the neutral-point-clamped (NPC) three-level (3L) converter. The proposed solution is very attractive for the recent 10 kV SiC MOSFETs due to several reasons: 1) the blocking voltage could be increased to 20 kV, suitable for most medium voltage applications; 2) with NPC 3L structure, the voltage balancing of series-connected devices is avoided; 3) with Q2L modulation, the total loss on clamping diodes is significantly reduced so the clamping diodes don\u2019t significantly increase converter volume. In this paper, the basic modulation strategy and its impact on the voltage balancing of dc bus capacitors will be discussed. With Q2L modulation, series-connected 3.3 kV SiC diodes with much smaller volume are chosen as an example as the clamping diodes to showcase the benefit of Q2L modulation. Meanwhile, the detail comparison of Q2L modulation is presented between NPC 3L converter and flying capacitor (FC) 3L converter. Single-phase pump-back test is conducted to demonstrate the Q2L modulation and its impact on clamping diode loss.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9570662/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9570662/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","publicationDate":"6 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Quasi-Two-Level Modulation for Neutral-Point-Clamped Three-level Converter with 10 kV SiC MOSFETs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Quasi-Two-Level Modulation for Neutral-Point-Clamped Three-level Converter with 10 kV SiC MOSFETs","confLoc":"Ghent, Belgium","sourcePdf":"0122-epe2021-full-11545292.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051914S","chronDate":"6-10 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9570185","isNumber":"9570186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9570185","xplore-issue":"9570186","articleId":"9570662","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9570718,"authors":[{"name":"Man Shi","affiliation":["MICAS, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/9647029/9570718/shi-3120103-small.gif","p":["Man Shi received the B.Sc. degree from the School of Information Science and Engineering from Shandong University (SDU), China, in 2017, and the M.Sc. degree from the Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, China, in 2020.

The trends towards higher-resolution input images and large-scale model structures have brought drastic performance improvements for these tasks. Yet, these trends also pose increased stress on hardware resources. Recent work proposed an advanced layer fusion method relying on the line-buffer depth-first (LBDF) processing, to reduce memory usage and off-chip memory accesses in high resolution CNN processing. However, when deploying such LBDF approach for residual networks, the required external memory access or on-chip memory capacity drastically increases again, hence canceling many benefits of the depth-first approach. This paper, therefore, outlines and analyzes the possible methods for handling residual connections (RC) in combination with LBDF. With the proposed ReLU-based compression and tiling techniques, we minimize the overhead of RC on on-chip memory requirements and external memory accesses. Moreover, a proposed hybrid strategy, optimally combining the different methods across different residual blocks of a residual network, yields for ResNet20 and SqueezeNet a reduction of 24.7% and 45.1% respectively in inference energy cost. Also the execution latency is reduced by 19.4% and 46.7% respectively in comparison to the best single method under certain on-chip memory budgets. In addition, compared to the SotAs, in the best case, our hybrid strategy only consumes 43% energy and 29.9% latency while use the same on-chip memories; only requires 27.4% on-chip memory to achieve the same performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9570718/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2021","volume":"11","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9570718/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Hardware-Efficient Residual Neural Network Execution in Line-Buffer Depth-First Processing","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Flemish Government (AI Research Program)"},{"fundingName":"EU ERC Research Programme","grantNumber":"715037"},{"fundingName":"Fund For Scientific Research Flanders (FWO-Vlaanderen)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware-Efficient Residual Neural Network Execution in Line-Buffer Depth-First Processing","sourcePdf":"jetcas-shi-3120103-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073742S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"9647029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","xplore-issue":"9647029","articleId":"9570718","onlineDate":"14 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9570733,"authors":[{"name":"Tingyang Wei","affiliation":["South China University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Tingyang","lastName":"Wei","id":"37086504399"},{"name":"Jinghui Zhong","affiliation":["South China University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Jinghui","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37085530253"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1556-603X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1556-6048"}],"articleNumber":"9570733","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":329},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9570733","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Hyperspectral sensors","Sensitivity analysis","Process control","Benchmark testing","Multitasking","Resource management","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","regression analysis","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized resource allocation","multistep nonlinear regression","generalized resource allocation framework","distinct multiobjective problem","multiobjective optimization","evolutionary multitask optimization","benchmark problems","multiobjective EMTO algorithm","GRA framework"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MCI.2021.3108310","pdfPath":"/iel7/10207/9570393/09570733.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","startPage":"20","endPage":"37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9570393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCI.2021.3108310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Generalized Resource Allocation on Evolutionary Multitasking for Multi-Objective Optimization","abstract":"Evolutionary multitasking optimization (EMTO) is an emerging paradigm for solving several problems simultaneously. Due to the flexible framework, EMTO has been naturally applied to multi-objective optimization to exploit synergy among distinct multi-objective problem domains. However, most studies barely take into account the scenario where some problems cannot converge under restrictive computational budgets with the traditional EMTO framework. To dynamically allocate computational resources for multi-objective EMTO problems, this article proposes a generalized resource allocation (GRA) framework by concerning both theoretical grounds of conventional resource allocation and the characteristics of multi-objective optimization. In the proposed framework, a normalized attainment function is designed for better quantifying convergence status, a multi-step nonlinear regression is proposed to serve as a stable performance estimator, and the algorithmic procedure of conventional resource allocation is refined for flexibly adjusting resource allocation intensity and including knowledge transfer information. It has been verified that the GRA framework can enhance the overall performance of the multi-objective EMTO algorithm in solving benchmark problems, complex problems, many-task problems, and a real-world application problem. Notably, the proposed GRA framework served as a crucial component for the winner algorithm in the Competition on Evolutionary Multi-Task Optimization (Multi-objective Optimization Track) in IEEE 2020 World Congress on Computational Intelligence.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9570733/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2021","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"21200410","volume":"16","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/9570733/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Towards Generalized Resource Allocation on Evolutionary Multitasking for Multi-Objective Optimization","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology of China","grantNumber":"2018B030312003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62076098"},{"fundingName":"Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams","grantNumber":"2017ZT07X183"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Generalized Resource Allocation on Evolutionary Multitasking for Multi-Objective Optimization","sourcePdf":"16mci04-wei-3108310-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129065S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"10207","isNumber":"9570393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10207","xplore-issue":"9570393","articleId":"9570733","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9570734,"authors":[{"name":"Zichi Wang","affiliation":["Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zichi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085664102"},{"name":"Guorui Feng","affiliation":["Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Guorui","lastName":"Feng","id":"37539439700"},{"name":"Hanzhou Wu","affiliation":["Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hanzhou","lastName":"Wu","id":"37074098000"},{"name":"Xinpeng Zhang","affiliation":["Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xinpeng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279340100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1556-603X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1556-6048"}],"articleNumber":"9570734","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9570734","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training data","Neural networks","Receivers","Robustness","Decoding","Data mining","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data encapsulation","decoding","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","data hiding scheme","network parameters","multiple receivers","data decoding networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MCI.2021.3108305","pdfPath":"/iel7/10207/9570393/09570734.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","startPage":"70","endPage":"84","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9570393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCI.2021.3108305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data Hiding in Neural Networks for Multiple Receivers [Research Frontier]","abstract":"Recently, neural networks have become a promising architecture for some intelligent tasks. In addition to conventional tasks such as classification, neural networks can be used for data hiding. This paper proposes a data hiding scheme to transmit different data to multiple receivers via the same neural network simultaneously. Additional data are embedded into the neural network during the process of training instead of modifying the network parameters after training. As a result, the reduction in detection accuracy of the neural network is trivial with additional data embedded. On the receiver side, additional data can be extracted using specific data decoding networks. Instead of training, the parameters of data decoding networks are generated using the embedding keys possessed by the receivers. Therefore, it is unnecessary to store and transmit the decoding networks secretly, and the practicability is satisfactory. A receiver can extract corresponding additional data with the correct embedding key. For other parts of additional data, the receiver cannot affirm their existence and therefore cannot extract them. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed data hiding scheme, including embedding capacity and robustness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9570734/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2021","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"21176137","volume":"16","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/9570734/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Data Hiding in Neural Networks for Multiple Receivers [Research Frontier]","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62002214, 62072295, 62072114 and U1936214"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007219","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai","grantNumber":"19ZR1419000"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Hiding in Neural Networks for Multiple Receivers [Research Frontier]","sourcePdf":"16mci04-research-3108305-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091292S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"10207","isNumber":"9570393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10207","xplore-issue":"9570393","articleId":"9570734","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-06"},{"_id":9570816,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Qian","affiliation":["University College London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8782661/9309127/9570816/qian-3120192-small.gif","p":["Jun Qian (Member, IEEE) received the bachelor\u2019s degree from Beihang University, China, in 2015, and the M.Sc. degree (Hons.) from University College London (UCL), U.K., in 2016, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Information and Communications Engineering Research Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering.

Multiple single-antenna user pairs exchange information via a shared relay working at half-duplex. The proposed scenario considers a practical case where an increasing number of antennas is deployed in a fixed physical space, giving rise to a trade-off between antenna gain and spatial correlation. The channel is assumed imperfectly known, and the relay employs linear processing methods. We study the large-scale approximations of the sum spectral efficiency (SE) and investigate the energy efficiency (EE) with a practical power consumption model when the number of relay antennas becomes large. We demonstrate the impact of the relay antenna number and spatial correlation with reducing inter-antenna distance on the EE performance. We exploit the increasing spatial correlation to allow an incomplete channel state information (CSI) acquisition where explicit CSI is acquired only for a subset of antennas. Our analytical derivations and numerical results show that applying the incomplete CSI strategy in the proposed system can improve the EE against complete CSI systems while maintaining the average SE performance.","doi":"10.1109/OJCOMS.2021.3120192","publicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8782661/9309127/09570816.pdf","startPage":"2357","endPage":"2371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OJCOMS.2021.3120192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9309127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multipair Relaying With Space-Constrained Large-Scale MIMO Arrays: Spectral and Energy Efficiency Analysis With Incomplete CSI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9570816","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9570816/","displayDocTitle":"Multipair Relaying With Space-Constrained Large-Scale MIMO Arrays: Spectral and Energy Efficiency Analysis With Incomplete CSI","volume":"2","publicationDate":"2021","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9570816/","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)","grantNumber":"EP/M014150/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Multipair Relaying With Space-Constrained Large-Scale MIMO Arrays: Spectral and Energy Efficiency Analysis With Incomplete CSI","sourcePdf":"ojcoms-qian-3120192-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09716S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"8782661","isNumber":"9309127","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8782661","xplore-issue":"9309127","articleId":"9570816","onlineDate":"14 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":9570887,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen O.

The activity results into huge financial and social loses and the vice is declared when human image is detected in the restricted area without authority to cause an unauthorized change in a predetermined scene that could be vandalized. This act requires an automated real-time detection of the presence of the vandal so that he can be stopped from damaging the property. Human Image recognition process is the best method for detection of vandalism. In this research paper, we propose a deep learning architecture combining Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short Term memory (CNN-LSTM) which has the ability to exhaust spatial relationship and temporal prediction of the output. The main objective of this research work is to develop, train, test and validate CNN-LSTM against CNN and LSTM models to prove the superiority of the proposed model in image recognition. Image detection is achieved by feeding the images captured by installed image sensors (CCD camera) to a hybrid neural network classifier which is trained to recognize human images. The CNN-LSTM hybrid approach not only improves the predictive accuracy of image recognition from raw data but also reduces the computational complexity. The model is trained and tested with image-Net dataset which is the largest clean image dataset for vision research. Results show that the proposed model is able to achieve a training accuracy of 98% while a standalone CNN achieved 88%. The result show that the hybrid model is superior.","doi":"10.1109/AFRICON51333.2021.9570902","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE AFRICON","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFRICON51333.2021.9570902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9570844","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE AFRICON","pdfPath":"/iel7/9570842/9570844/09570902.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CNN Real-Time Detection of Vandalism Using a Hybrid -LSTM Deep Learning Neural Networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9570902/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"CNN Real-Time Detection of Vandalism Using a Hybrid -LSTM Deep Learning Neural Networks.","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9570902/","publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CNN Real-Time Detection of Vandalism Using a Hybrid -LSTM Deep Learning Neural Networks.","confLoc":"Arusha, Tanzania, United Republic of","sourcePdf":"paper_95.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081659S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9570842","isNumber":"9570844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9570842","xplore-issue":"9570844","articleId":"9570902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9570907,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Macharia","affiliation":["PAUSTI, Nairobi, Kenya"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Macharia","id":"37089006572"},{"name":"Kibet Lang\u2019at","affiliation":["JKUAT, Nairobi, Kenya"],"firstName":"Kibet","lastName":"Lang\u2019at","id":"37089002401"},{"name":"Peter Kihato","affiliation":["JKUAT, Nairobi, Kenya"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Kihato","id":"37089003678"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1983-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4748-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0033"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-0025"}],"articleNumber":"9570907","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9570907","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Array signal processing","Collaboration","Interference","Receivers","Tools","Minimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Collaborative beamforming","Wireless sensor network","Unmanned aerial vehicle","Sidelobe minimization","Interference","Capacity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AFRICON51333.2021.9570907","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE AFRICON","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE AFRICON","pdfPath":"/iel7/9570842/9570844/09570907.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFRICON51333.2021.9570907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9570844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Management upon Collaborative Beamforming in a Wireless Sensor Network Monitoring System featuring Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","abstract":"Collaborative beamforming (CBF) has been proposed as a viable tool towards increasing node transmission range in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs).

All designs are formulated by placing a metasurface wall vertically between the two radiating antenna elements. The first antenna design is achieved by placing a single metasurface wall between the two antenna elements. While the second and third designs are achieved by placing the double and triple metasurface wall, respectively. In the first design, a slight increase of 0.5 dB in the antenna\u2019s mutual coupling is seen. While the second design achieves a mutual coupling reduction from \u221223 dB to \u221234 dB. Lastly, the third design achieves the mutual coupling reduction from \u221223 dB to \u221234 dB, while obtaining up to 17% bandwidth enhancement at (5.86 \u2013 6.10) GHz frequency range.

Literature shows that most of the allocated spectrum is used sporadically. This brings in the idea of dynamic spectrum access techniques using Cognitive Radios (CR). Little research attention has focussed on the real-time measurements of spectrum occupancy. Hence, the proposed research investigates the spectrum occupancy to determine how often frequency channels for TV bands are utilised. This was achieved by installing a low-cost spectrum sensor using Yagi Antennas to monitor the TV spectrum bands, applying statistical analysis tool for data processing. The study used Energy detection techniques to determine the spectrum occupation status, i.e., whether the spectrum is vacant or occupied.

Broadband communications will play a significant role in the realisation of Africa\u2019s potential. The fourth industrial revolution (4IR), also referred to as Industry 4.0, is rapidly changing the industrial and manufacturing space in Africa through the use of automation and modern technology. A number of emerging communication technologies are working together to help drive the realisation of 4IR. One relevant technology that is very critical to the realisation of 4IR is cognitive radio networks (CRN). The CRN can mitigate the effect of spectrum scarcity and underutilisation by enabling multiple networks to co-use (either simultaneously or opportunistically) a spectrum space, as long as the predefined network conditions are not violated. This paper studies the critical aspects of CRN and their application towards the realisation of 4IR in Africa and beyond.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9570943/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9570943/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Radio Networks Application in the Fourth Industrial Revolution for Africa Development","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Radio Networks Application in the Fourth Industrial Revolution for Africa Development","confLoc":"Arusha, Tanzania, United Republic of","sourcePdf":"paper_50.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080544S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9570842","isNumber":"9570844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9570842","xplore-issue":"9570844","articleId":"9570943","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":9570964,"authors":[{"name":"Emmanuel C.

According to the optimization and sensitivity analysis results, a final design which is superior to the base design was achieved. There were 15 % and 13.2 % improvement in the optimized model in terms of the average torque and efficiency respectively. Also, the optimized model recorded a reduction in the average torque ripple and total loss by 1.55 % and 30.1 % respectively.

To ensure coherent detection of a transmitted signal, there is a need for robust tracking and estimation of the sparse channel. An enhanced time-varying sparse channel estimator is proposed based on the exploitation of inherent temporal correlation in the channel. It is named adaptive step size iterative hard thresholding (ASS-IHT)- based time-varying, sparse channel estimator. The ASS-IHT-based estimator is documented in comparison with some other estimators. From the results obtained from the simulation performed, the proposed ASS-IHT-based estimator performs better than all the other estimators simulated in this paper. This unique performance can be attributed to (i) the effectiveness of the original algorithm, the iterative hard thresholding upon which the estimator is built, (ii) the exploitation of the sparse channel\u2019s inherent temporal correlation, and (iii) the enhancing effects of the adaptive step size incorporated into the estimator. In terms of the comparative computational complexity costs, the proposed ASS-IHT-based time-varying estimator\u2019s complexity cost is within the range of the complexity costs of other channel estimators simulated in this paper.","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE AFRICON","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE AFRICON","pdfPath":"/iel7/9570842/9570844/09570975.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/AFRICON51333.2021.9570975","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFRICON51333.2021.9570975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9570844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Step Size Iterative Hard Thresholding-based Time-Varying Sparse Channel Estimator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9570975/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Step Size Iterative Hard Thresholding-based Time-Varying Sparse Channel Estimator","htmlLink":"/document/9570975/","publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001321","fundingName":"National Research Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Step Size Iterative Hard Thresholding-based Time-Varying Sparse Channel Estimator","confLoc":"Arusha, Tanzania, United Republic of","sourcePdf":"paper_19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075714S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9570842","isNumber":"9570844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9570842","xplore-issue":"9570844","articleId":"9570975","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":9571014,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Nyanumba Mwaro","affiliation":["School of Computing and Information Technology, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Nairobi, Kenya"],"firstName":"Patrick Nyanumba","lastName":"Mwaro","id":"37089003542"},{"name":"Kennedy Ogada","affiliation":["School of Computing and Information Technology, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Nairobi, Kenya"],"firstName":"Kennedy","lastName":"Ogada","id":"37089005853"},{"name":"Wilson Cheruiyot","affiliation":["School of Computing and Information Technology, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Nairobi, Kenya"],"firstName":"Wilson","lastName":"Cheruiyot","id":"37086417595"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1984-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1983-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4748-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0033"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-0025"}],"articleNumber":"9571014","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9571014","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bibliographies","Neural networks","Machine learning","Predictive models","Object recognition","Recruitment","Business"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Accuracy","machine learning","neural network","Recruitment","Talent management"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AFRICON51333.2021.9571014","pdfPath":"/iel7/9570842/9570844/09571014.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE AFRICON","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE AFRICON","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9570844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFRICON51333.2021.9571014","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Model for Talent Recruitment and Management for Employee Development and Retention","abstract":"Talent management is the process of identifying the vacant position, recruiting the suitable person, developing the skills and expertise of the person to make the person more suitable for the position and retaining him to achieve long term business objectives of the institution.

While signal quantization provides many physical advantages, it usually degrades the subsequent estimation performance that is based on quantized data. In an attempt to maintain physical constraints, while, simultaneously, to attain substantial performance gain, we consider systems with mixed-resolution, 1-bit quantized and continuous-valued, data. First, we describe the linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) estimator and its associated mean-squared error (MSE) for the general mixed-resolution model. However, the MSE of the LMMSE requires matrix inversion, where the number of measurements defines the matrix dimensions and thus, may not be a tractable tool for optimization and system design. Therefore, we present the linear Gaussian orthonormal (LGO) measurement model and derive a closed-form analytic expression for the MSE of the LMMSE estimator under this model. We discuss two common special cases of the LGO model: 1) scalar parameter estimation, and 2) channel estimation in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems with mixed analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). We then solve the resource allocation optimization problem under the LGO model, with the proposed tractable MSE as an objective function and under a power constraint by using a one-dimensional search. Further, we present the concept of dithering for mixed-resolution models and optimize the dithering noise as part of the resource allocation optimization problem. Simulations show that the proposed resource allocation and dithering policies provide significant performance improvement.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3119430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","startPage":"6148","endPage":"6164","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09571074.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation and Dithering of Bayesian Parameter Estimation Using Mixed-Resolution Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9571074/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9571074/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation and Dithering of Bayesian Parameter Estimation Using Mixed-Resolution Data","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"69","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003977","fundingName":"Israel Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1173/16"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation and Dithering of Bayesian Parameter Estimation Using Mixed-Resolution Data","sourcePdf":"tsp-routtenberg-3119430-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157304S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9571074","onlineDate":"14 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-18"},{"_id":9571339,"authors":[{"name":"Tongyun Li","affiliation":["Centre for Photonic Systems, Electrical Division, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Tongyun","lastName":"Li","id":"37677512900"},{"name":"Lu Bai","affiliation":["Centre for Photonic Systems, Electrical Division, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Bai","id":"37089009690"},{"name":"Jingyun Zhang","affiliation":["University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Jingyun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37089011040"},{"name":"Andrew W.

To ensure optimal spectrum utilization, when the primary user (PU) is detected to be present on the channel or there is a decrease in spectrum quality, the secondary user (SU) must switch or remain on the channel, this condition is known as spectrum mobility. One of the problems related to spectrum mobility is spectrum handoff, where this handoff plays an important role in supporting the availability and performance of spectrum mobility. This paper presents various schematic handoff modeling techniques for secondary users in performing spectrum handoffs. Apart from channel efficiency, minimizing the number of handoffs is also a challenge. In the future, it is necessary to strive for a handoff algorithm that can adapt to these conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9573192/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"18 Sept. 2021","conferenceDate":"18-19 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9573192/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Review of Spectrum Handoff Schemes in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Review of Spectrum Handoff Schemes in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Semarangin, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"27_1570721363.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08145S","chronDate":"18-19 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9571070","isNumber":"9573172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9571070","xplore-issue":"9573172","articleId":"9573192","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":9573193,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Apart from the importance and necessity of the WBAN, there are some problems in WBAN such as inaccurate measurements, hardware failures, discharged sensors, and sensors running out of energy which can cause false alarms and reduce confidence in using the WBAN system for remote health services. This research aims to create a system or modelling to solve anomalous data problems in WBAN health data. The system will process data to produce an analysis of information in an anomalous condition by applying the statistical method using Mahalanobis Distance and the prediction method using SMOreg. The process of collecting data and pre-processing is carried out before completing the detection of anomalous features. The data normalization process is carried out to make the process faster. This approach was tested on a real health dataset on the WBAN sensor. The results of the implementation show that the method produced a high-performance detection ratio (DR), which is above 80%. In addition, the experiment resulted that the size of the sliding window affected the anomaly detection results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection in Wireless Body Area Network using Mahalanobis Distance and Sequential Minimal Optimization Regression","publicationTitle":"2021 International Seminar on Application for Technology of Information and Communication (iSemantic)","doi":"10.1109/iSemantic52711.2021.9573193","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Seminar on Application for Technology of Information and Communication (iSemantic)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9571070/9573172/09573193.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"69","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iSemantic52711.2021.9573193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9573172","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9573193","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9573193/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection in Wireless Body Area Network using Mahalanobis Distance and Sequential Minimal Optimization Regression","conferenceDate":"18-19 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9573193/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2021","publicationDate":"18 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010447","fundingName":"Ministry of Research and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia","grantNumber":"B/112/E3/RA.00/2021"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection in Wireless Body Area Network using Mahalanobis Distance and Sequential Minimal Optimization Regression","confLoc":"Semarangin, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"13_1570724082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074219S","chronDate":"18-19 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9571070","isNumber":"9573172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9571070","xplore-issue":"9573172","articleId":"9573193","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9573199,"authors":[{"name":"Ramadhan Renaldy","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, University of Dian Nuswantoro, Semarang, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Ramadhan","lastName":"Renaldy"},{"name":"Muljono","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, University of Dian Nuswantoro, Semarang, Indonesia"],"lastName":"Muljono"},{"name":"Guruh Fajar Shidik","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, University of Dian Nuswantoro, Semarang, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Guruh Fajar","lastName":"Shidik"},{"name":"Catur Supriyanto","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, University of Dian Nuswantoro, Semarang, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Catur","lastName":"Supriyanto"},{"name":"M.A. Soeleman","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, University of Dian Nuswantoro, Semarang, Indonesia"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Soeleman"},{"name":"Ahmad Zainul Fanani","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, University of Dian Nuswantoro, Semarang, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Ahmad Zainul","lastName":"Fanani"},{"name":"Aditya Dwi Pratama","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, University of Dian Nuswantoro, Semarang, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Aditya Dwi","lastName":"Pratama"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2804-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2805-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9573199","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["COVID-19","Support vector machines","Seminars","Sentiment analysis","Social networking (online)","Pandemics","Stacking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sentiment Analysis","Stacking","Ensemble Method","COVID-19","Indonesian Tweets"]}],"abstract":"Sentiment analysis is opinion mining that focuses on learning about sentiments, attitudes or emotions in a text.

To date, most of the remarkable achievements, however, exploit shallow models to learn shared feature representations based on incomplete views. Although some deep learning methods have been proposed to solve this issue, the existing ones still have the following problems: 1) The consistency between views is ignored, which will have serious negative impacts on incomplete multi-view learning. 2) The learned features do not have sufficient cluster-friendliness, that is, the tightness within clusters and the repulsiveness between clusters are not fully considered. To tackle the above shortcomings, we propose a Dual Alignment Self-supervised Incomplete Multi-view Subspace Clustering network (DASIMSC) in this paper. Specifically, the manifold alignment constraint and consistency alignment constraint are integrated with the autoencoder to preserve the compact inherent local structure within the view and the consistency semantics between incomplete views, respectively. Moreover, a self-expression layer coupled with a spectral clustering module is designed to naturally separate different types of data, leveraging the current clustering results to supervise subspace learning, which excludes inter-cluster. Experimental results on several datasets show that our algorithm outperforms all compared state-of-the-arts.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual Alignment Self-Supervised Incomplete Multi-View Subspace Clustering Network","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3120311","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9325893/09573269.pdf","startPage":"2122","endPage":"2126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3120311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9325893","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9573269","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9573269/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Dual Alignment Self-Supervised Incomplete Multi-View Subspace Clustering Network","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","htmlLink":"/document/9573269/","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2021","publicationDate":"2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61906030"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"DUT20RC(4)009"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005047","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province","grantNumber":"2020-BS-063"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual Alignment Self-Supervised Incomplete Multi-View Subspace Clustering Network","sourcePdf":"lsp-zhao-3120311-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059949S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9325893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9325893","articleId":"9573269","onlineDate":"14 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-06"},{"_id":9573271,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu Sichuan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9573271/zhang-3119777-small.gif","p":["Sheng Zhang (Senior Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree from the College of Mathematics and Information Sciences, North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power, Zhengzhou, China, in 2010 and the Ph.D. degree in signal and information processing from Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China, in 2016.

To tackle such an issue with reduced computational complexity, this paper introduces adaptive frequency-domain normalized implementations of widely-linear complex-valued filter. Two normalized algorithms are firstly devised based on the circulant matrices of weight coefficients and the regression vector, respectively. In the design, the normalization matrix using the second-order complementary statistical information of the input signal helps increase the algorithm convergence speed. Then, mean-square and complementary mean-square performance of periodic update frequency-domain widely-linear normalized LMS (P-FDWL-NLMS) algorithm for non-circular complex signals is analyzed. In addition, by introducing a variable-periodic (VP) mechanism, we propose the VP-FDWL-NLMS method that provides faster convergence than the P-FDWL-NLMS scheme.

This paper investigates the trade-off between DOA estimation and power consumption in large antenna arrays with HAD architectures. Particularly, the DOA estimation problem of fully-connected, sub-connected (SC), and switches-based (SE) hybrid architectures is formulated into a unified expression, with the compression matrix in a time-varying form. Based on this model, we derive a dynamic maximum likelihood (D-ML) estimator that is suitable for both HAD and conventional fully digital (FD) structures, and the closed-form expression of Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (CRB) to evaluate the performance limit of the D-ML estimator for different HAD structures. The theoretical CRB analysis in the single-source case reveals that, the SC structure has the ability to achieve approximately the same performance as the FD structures at DOAs around zero, but suffers from the inherent angle ambiguity because of the antenna grouping. In addition, we propose a dynamic SC (D-SC) structure that is proved to eliminate the angle ambiguity with time-varying phase shifters, and a switch optimization (SWO) algorithm to minimize the CRB of SE structures. Finally, we introduce a new metric, DOA efficiency, to measure the trade-off between the DOA estimation performance and power consumption of different structures. Simulation results verify our theoretical analysis and the superiority of the proposed D-SC structure and the SWO algorithm.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9675017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3119768","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9675017/09573279.pdf","startPage":"72","endPage":"88","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3119768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direction-of-Arrival Estimation for Large Antenna Arrays With Hybrid Analog and Digital Architectures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","displayDocTitle":"Direction-of-Arrival Estimation for Large Antenna Arrays With Hybrid Analog and Digital Architectures","volume":"70","htmlLink":"/document/9573279/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2022","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9573279/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20210335"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100014188","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea","grantNumber":"IITP-2021-0-02048"},{"fundingName":"NRF","grantNumber":"2020R1A2C210198"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direction-of-Arrival Estimation for Large Antenna Arrays With Hybrid Analog and Digital Architectures","sourcePdf":"tsp-zhang-3119768-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.190661S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9675017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9675017","articleId":"9573279","onlineDate":"14 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9573285,"authors":[{"name":"Kuangshi Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Kuangshi","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0002-4838-650X","id":"37088594299"},{"name":"Yuenan Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yuenan","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0001-8932-851X","id":"37088591075"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9573285","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":24},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Task analysis","Decoding","Training","Computer architecture","Logic gates","Neural networks","Atmospheric modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dehazing","semi-supervised learning","domain translation","automated architecture search"]}],"abstract":"Data-driven methods have demonstrated great potential in single image dehazing, most of which are trained using the hazy images synthesized by the atmospheric scattering model. However, the model cannot accurately describe the complicated degradation caused by haze. At the same time, it is impractical to obtain the pixel-to-pixel aligned clear-scene counterparts of real-world hazy images for supervised training. In this letter, we formulate dehazing as a semi-supervised domain translation problem. For better generalization, two auxiliary domain translation tasks are designed to capture the properties of real-world haze and align synthetic hazy images to real-world ones to reduce the domain gap. Dehazing and the auxiliary tasks are conducted in shared latent spaces by a unified framework, and we use differential optimization to search the architectures of the framework. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed work using one synthetic and three real-world benchmarks that cover the challenging cases in wild scenarios, and it outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on these benchmarks. The benefits brought by auxiliary domain translation tasks and architecture search are also verified by ablation experiments.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3120322","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9325893/09573285.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3120322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9325893","startPage":"2127","endPage":"2131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single Image Dehazing via Semi-Supervised Domain Translation and Architecture Search","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9573285","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Single Image Dehazing via Semi-Supervised Domain Translation and Architecture Search","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9573285/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2021","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9573285/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61972281 and 61572352"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single Image Dehazing via Semi-Supervised Domain Translation and Architecture Search","sourcePdf":"lsp-li-3120322-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057644S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9325893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9325893","articleId":"9573285","onlineDate":"14 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-06"},{"_id":9573299,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Donghua University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/9655601/9573299/zhang-3120291-small.gif","p":["Kai Zhang received the B.S. degree in electronic and information engineering from the Wenhua College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.

In our proposed scheme, the input information bits are transmitted not only by modulated symbols, but also by the activated transmit antennas pattern and the selected spreading code patterns for the in-phase and quadrature components. Due to the increase of the index dimension, more information bits can be implicitly transmitted, which can improve energy efficiency and have a higher data rate compared with spatial modulation (SM), generalized SM (GSM), generalized CIM-aided SM (GCIM-SM) and CIM-aided quadrature spatial modulation (CIM-QSM). In order to further reduce the complexity of despreading-based maximum likelihood (ML) detection, we propose an enhanced low-complexity detector that can achieve near-ML error performance. An analytical upper bound on the average bit error probability associated with the optimal ML detection is derived, which is verified by simulation results. Simulation results also show that the proposed GSCIM scheme outperforms SM, GSM, GCIM-SM and CIM-QSM schemes in terms of error performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9573299/","volume":"70","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9573299/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Space-Code Index Modulation for High Rate and Energy-Efficient MIMO Transmission","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61801106"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai","grantNumber":"20ZR1400700"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Fund of the National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008081","fundingName":"Southeast University","grantNumber":"2020D03"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"},{"fundingName":"Graduate Student Innovation Fund of Donghua University","grantNumber":"CUSF-DH-D-2021053"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Space-Code Index Modulation for High Rate and Energy-Efficient MIMO Transmission","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhang-3120291-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111117S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"9655601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","xplore-issue":"9655601","articleId":"9573299","onlineDate":"14 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9573305,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Mohebbi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/9655601/9573305/moheb-3120298-small.gif","p":["Ali Mohebbi (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Azad University of Karaj, Karaj, Iran, in 2006, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Azad University, South Tehran Branch, Tehran, Iran, in 2011.

Utilizing the basis expansion model (BEM) for effectively representing doubly selective channels, we first propose a BEM-based block orthogonal matching pursuit (BBOMP) algorithm, which can work with any training sequence structure. Next, we present the second algorithm to reduce the complexity of the BBOMP method by employing a special training sequence which results in a computationally efficient block sparse sensing matrix. Finally, in order to further decrease the computational complexity, we propose the third algorithm, where the channel estimation is split into two separate steps of tap detection and gain estimation. The proposed algorithms exploit the entire available training sequence to estimate all channel parameters, and can capture channel variations across the entire training frames without requiring a feedback channel. The Cramer-Rao lower bound and the computational complexity of the proposed algorithms are also addressed. Intensive computer simulations are conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed approaches, showing that they can significantly improve the mean squared error performance compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9655601","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2021.3120298","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/9655601/09573305.pdf","startPage":"12821","endPage":"12835","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2021.3120298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Doubly Selective Channel Estimation Algorithms for Millimeter Wave Hybrid MIMO Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Doubly Selective Channel Estimation Algorithms for Millimeter Wave Hybrid MIMO Systems","volume":"70","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9573305/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9573305/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Regroupement Strategique en Microsystemes du Quebec"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Doubly Selective Channel Estimation Algorithms for Millimeter Wave Hybrid MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-mohebbi-3120298-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121133S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"9655601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","xplore-issue":"9655601","articleId":"9573305","onlineDate":"14 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9573311,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Zhang","affiliation":["Sino-German Joint Software Institute, School of Computer Science, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0003-0558-372X"},{"name":"Yi Liu","affiliation":["Sino-German Joint Software Institute, School of Computer Science, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0003-1829-2817"},{"name":"Tao Liu","affiliation":["Shandong Academy of Sciences, Qilu University of Technology, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Liu"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2183"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9883"}],"articleNumber":"9573311","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":34},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Instruction sets","Servers","Dispatching","Measurement","Load management","Task analysis","Network systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quality of service","parallel systems","performance measurements"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"iBalancer: Load-Aware in-Server Flow Scheduling for Sub-Millisecond Tail Latency","abstract":"Achieving microsecond-scale tail latency poses an extreme challenge to the conventional architecture of \u201cNIC-OS-Application\u201d in the face of high concurrent requests. Existing kernel-bypass network systems improve this situation significantly. Still, they cannot achieve load-aware in-server requests distribution, which in turn not only harms resource efficiency but, more importantly, beats the goal of squeezing tail latency. This paper proposes iBalancer, an in-server proactive load balancer for the kernel-bypass system, which aggressively handles NIC-side flow scheduling according to the load of threads on the processor-side. Furthermore, we propose a novel metric, \u201cpolling time interval (PTI),\u201d to quantify the load of worker threads, which not only indicates utilization of the core bound to the worker thread but also reflects the differences in the processing time of different flows. By scheduling flows according to the metric PTI, iBalancer tends to average the queueing latencies of different flows, such as Set & Get operations for an in-memory key-value store. In addition, by decoupling flow scheduling from packet steering, iBalancer achieves a tail latency aware flow-to-core binding and preserves hardware-based request distribution among cores. The proposed system is evaluated and compared to mTCP and Shenango using two representative microsecond-scale network applications: Memcached KVS and a real-time deep-learning-based financial fraud identification application.

We study the user-perceived delay-aware service placement and user-allocation problem in edge environment. We model the MEC-enabled network, where the user-perceived delay consists of computing delay and transmission delay. The total cost in the offloading system is defined as the sum of service placement, edge server usage and energy consumption cost, and we need to minimize the total cost by determining the overall service-placing decision and user-allocation decision, while guaranteeing that the user-perceived delay requirement of each user is fulfilled. Our considered problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming problem, and we prove its NP-hardness. Due to the intractability of the considered problem, we propose a LOCal-search based algorithm for USer-perceived delay-aware service placement and user-allocation in edge environment, named LOCUS, which starts with a feasible solution and then repeatedly reduces the total cost by performing local-search steps. After that, we analyze the time complexity of LOCUS and prove that it achieves provable guaranteed performance. Finally, we compare LOCUS with other existing methods and show its good performance through experiments.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2021.3119948","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/9603995/09573423.pdf","startPage":"1581","endPage":"1592","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2021.3119948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9603995","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LOCUS: User-Perceived Delay-Aware Service Placement and User Allocation in MEC Environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9573423","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1 2022","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9573423/","displayDocTitle":"LOCUS: User-Perceived Delay-Aware Service Placement and User Allocation in MEC Environment","volume":"33","issue":"7","publicationDate":"1 July 2022","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9573423/","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2017YFB1001801"},{"fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61872175 and 61832008"},{"fundingName":"Collaborative Innovation Center of Novel Software Technology and Industrialization"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LOCUS: User-Perceived Delay-Aware Service Placement and User Allocation in MEC Environment","sourcePdf":"tpds-zhang-3119948-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.204582S","chronDate":"July 1 2022","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"9603995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","xplore-issue":"9603995","articleId":"9573423","onlineDate":"14 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-06"},{"_id":9573427,"authors":[{"name":"Metin Vural","affiliation":["Technical University of Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Metin","lastName":"Vural","orcid":"0000-0003-1252-7646","id":"37061899900"},{"name":"Aleksandr Y.

Instrumentation can directly benefit from this technology by enabling the development of novel broadband sources or synthesizers that rely on our ability to amplify the signal over enormous bandwidths. However, the design of high gain and stable amplifiers presents many obstacles and limitations as we increase the bandwidth and the carrier frequency. Here, we show that adding a series resistor at the collector terminal of the common-base transistor prevents instabilities in the terahertz monolithic integrated circuit amplifier and increases its fractional bandwidth. Adopting this technique, we report a state-of-the-art broadband common-base amplifier that exhibits a minimum small-signal gain of 18.9 dB from 325 to 477 GHz.

To tackle this problem, this article proposes to learn a lightweight detector named Light-YOLOv4, and it is obtained from YOLOv4 through model compression. To this end, first, we perform sparsity training by applying L1 regularization to the channel scaling factors, so the less important channels and layers can be found. Second, channel pruning and layer pruning are enforced on the network to prune the less important parts, which could significantly reduce network's width and depth. Third, the pruned model is retrained with a knowledge distillation method to improve the detection accuracy. Fourth, the model is quantized from FP32 to FP16, and it could further accelerate the model with almost no loss of detection accuracy. Finally, to evaluate Light-YOLOv4's performance on edge devices, Light-YOLOv4 is deployed on NVIDIA Jetson TX2. Experiments on the SAR ship detection dataset (SSDD) demonstrate that the model size, parameter size, and FLOPs of Light-YOLOv4 have been reduced by 98.63%, 98.66%, and 91.30% compared with YOLOv4, and the detection speed has been increased to 4.2\u00d7. While the detection accuracy of Light-YOLOv4 is only slightly reduced, for example, the mAP has only reduced by 0.013. Besides, experiments on the Gaofen Airplane dataset also prove the feasibility of Light-YOLOv4. Moreover, compared with other state-of-the-art methods, such as SSD and FPN, Light-YOLOv4 is more suitable for edge devices.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3120009","startPage":"10808","endPage":"10820","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/9314330/09573455.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3120009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9314330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Light-YOLOv4: An Edge-Device Oriented Target Detection Method for Remote Sensing Images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object detection","Image edge detection","Training","Remote sensing","Detectors","Feature extraction","Quantization (signal)"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Edge device","model compression","NVIDIA Jetson TX2","remote sensing","target detection","YOLOv4"]}],"topic":"Collaborative Learning and Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9573455/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Light-YOLOv4: An Edge-Device Oriented Target Detection Method for Remote Sensing Images","volume":"14","htmlLink":"/document/9573455/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62001480"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Light-YOLOv4: An Edge-Device Oriented Target Detection Method for Remote Sensing Images","sourcePdf":"jstars-ma-3120009-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150524S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"9314330","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","xplore-issue":"9314330","topics":["Collaborative Learning and Optimization"],"articleId":"9573455","onlineDate":"14 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9573483,"authors":[{"name":"Huake Wang","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9573483/wang-3114998-small.gif","p":["Huake Wang received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering and the Ph.D. degree in signal and information processing from Xidian University, Xi'an, in 2015 and 2020, respectively.

However, it is revealed in this work that the range resolution scales linearly with the number of elements, which is limited by the fixed element number. By leveraging the relationship between the beam direction and the signal frequency, we link the sub-bands of the emitted signal to angular sectors. Based on the fact, a novel transmit diversity technique, referred to as two-dimensional (2-D) space-time coding (STC), is proposed to improve the range resolution. For a specific observation direction, the frequency band of each pulse is shifted by STC to synthesize a full bandwidth after the pulse accumulation. Furthermore, the piecewise LFM (linear frequency modulation) waveform design can be combined with the STC technique to synthesize the transmit beampattern flexibly without range resolution degradation for each pulse. Compared with the state-of-the-art technologies, the proposed STC technique has superiorities in range resolution improvement, ultra-low range sidelobe level, interference suppression, and beampattern design capability. In addition, multi-dimensional ambiguity functions are derived to assess the performance in range-angle-Doppler domain, including the range and angle resolutions, the sidelobe level (SLL) and the angular coverage. To satisfy practical demands, the general receive processing procedures are also designed. The proposed method and corresponding theoretical analysis are verified by extensive numerical results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9573483/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"69","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9573483/","displayDocTitle":"Space-Time Coding Technique for Coherent Frequency Diverse Array","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61931016, 61772397 and 62071344"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100014219","fundingName":"National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars","grantNumber":"61925108"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingName":"Robot Fundamental Research Center of Shenzhen Government","grantNumber":"U1713217 and U1913203"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-Time Coding Technique for Coherent Frequency Diverse Array","sourcePdf":"tsp-wang-3114998-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.177043S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9573483","onlineDate":"14 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":9573486,"authors":[{"name":"Abdul Karim Gizzini","affiliation":["ETIS, UMR8051, CY Cergy Paris Universit\u00e9, ENSEA, CNRS, Cergy, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/9655601/9573486/gizzi-3120267-small.gif","p":["Abdul Karim Gizzini (Student Member, IEEE) received the bachelor's degree in computer and communication engineering (B.E.) from the IUL university of Lebanon, in 2015 followed by the M.E. degree in 2017.

A major challenge in the development of this technology is ensuring communication reliability in highly dynamic vehicular environments, where the wireless communication channels are doubly selective, thus making channel estimation and tracking a relevant problem to investigate. In this paper, a novel deep learning (DL)-based weighted interpolation estimator is proposed to accurately estimate vehicular channels especially in high mobility scenarios. The proposed estimator is based on modifying the pilot allocation of the IEEE 802.11p standard so that more transmission data rates are achieved. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the developed estimator significantly outperforms the recently proposed DL-based frame-by-frame estimators in different vehicular scenarios, while substantially reducing the overall computational complexity.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9655601","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2021.3120267","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/9655601/09573486.pdf","startPage":"12796","endPage":"12811","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2021.3120267","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CNN Aided Weighted Interpolation for Channel Estimation in Vehicular Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","displayDocTitle":"CNN Aided Weighted Interpolation for Channel Estimation in Vehicular Communications","volume":"70","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9573486/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9573486/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ASIA Chair of Excellence","grantNumber":"PIA/ANR-16-IDEX-0008"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CNN Aided Weighted Interpolation for Channel Estimation in Vehicular Communications","sourcePdf":"tvt-gizzini-3120267-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119163S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"9655601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","xplore-issue":"9655601","articleId":"9573486","onlineDate":"14 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9573512,"authors":[{"name":"San Jiang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China","Hubei Key Laboratory of Intelligent Geo-Information Processing, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/9314330/9573512/jiang-3119990-small.gif","p":["San Jiang received the B.S. degree in remote sensing science and technology from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2010, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in photogrammetry and remote sensing from Wuhan University, in 2012 and 2018, respectively.","From 2012 to 2014, he worked as an Assistant Engineer with Tianjin Institute of Surveying and Mapping.

Matching local feature descriptors is the prerequisite for the accurate and complete orientation of UAV images. Recently, some newly proposed learned methods have been shown to outperform the hand-crafted methods, such as the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) and its variants, and almost all learned methods have been trained and evaluated by using images from the internet with varying focal lengths and varying size. It is of interest to investigate the performance of these learned methods with their pretrained models for feature detection and description in the context of the SfM-based orientation. Thus, this article conducts a comprehensive evaluation of both advanced hand-crafted and newly proposed learned detectors and descriptors by using four UAV datasets. The performance of these selected methods is compared in the context of feature matching and the SfM and (multiview stereo) MVS-based reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that the learned descriptors combined with the SIFT-like detectors can provide accurate and complete feature correspondences and achieve better or competitive performance in the SfM and MVS-based reconstruction. For UAV image orientation, the learned descriptors can be an alternative to the existing hand-crafted descriptors without their model retraining. The source codes of this evaluation would be made publicly available.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9573512/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9573512/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","publicationDate":"2021","accessionNumber":"21256016","volume":"14","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Learned Local Features for Structure From Motion of UAV Images: A Comparative Evaluation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"42001413 and 41925007"},{"fundingName":"Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"2020CFB324"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004701","fundingName":"China University of Geosciences, Wuhan","grantNumber":"CUG2106314"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011297","fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007046","fundingName":"Wuhan University","grantNumber":"20E03"},{"fundingName":"Key Research and Development Projects of Hunan Science and Technology Plan","grantNumber":"2015GK3027"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Learned Local Features for Structure From Motion of UAV Images: A Comparative Evaluation","sourcePdf":"jstars-jiang-3119990-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129235S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"9314330","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","xplore-issue":"9314330","articleId":"9573512","onlineDate":"14 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-27"},{"_id":9573534,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Adel Alsakati","affiliation":["Faculty of Innovation and Technology, School of Computer Science & Engineering, Taylor's University, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Ahmad Adel","lastName":"Alsakati","id":"37088887523"},{"name":"Chockalingam Aravind Vaithilingam","affiliation":["Faculty of Innovation and Technology, School of Computer Science & Engineering, Taylor's University, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Chockalingam Aravind","lastName":"Vaithilingam","id":"37086606957"},{"name":"Kanendra Naidu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, College of Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Kanendra","lastName":"Naidu","id":"37073235200"},{"name":"Gowthamraj Rajendran","affiliation":["Faculty of Innovation and Technology, School of Computer Science & Engineering, Taylor's University, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Gowthamraj","lastName":"Rajendran","id":"37088830612"},{"name":"Jamal Alnasseir","affiliation":["Faculty of Mechanical & Electrical Engineering, Damascus University, Damascus, Syria"],"firstName":"Jamal","lastName":"Alnasseir","id":"37088865584"},{"name":"Arthanari Jagadeeshwaran","affiliation":["Sona College of Technology, Salem, India"],"firstName":"Arthanari","lastName":"Jagadeeshwaran","id":"37088888232"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2899-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2900-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9573534","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":22},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Simulation","Power system stability","Stability analysis","Generators","Transient analysis","Particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Two-area four-machine system","Particle Swarm Optimization PSO","Power System Stabilizer PSS","Power System Stability","Transient Stability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9573534","abstract":"System stability plays a significant role in the development of modern power systems.

In this research work, the transient stability of the two-area four-machine system is improved using PSS1A. PSS1A is a single-input single-band power system stabilizer. The PSS1A parameters are optimized using PSO to enhance the stability and mitigate the oscillations. The simulation results of the relative power angle of Synchronous Generators (SGs) show that the transient stability is significantly improved with Optimized PSS1A (O-PSS1A), and the oscillations are mitigated. The maximum relative power angle of generator 1 and generator 2, with respect to generator 4, reduced by 29.5% and 33.6% respectively with the proposed O-PSS1A. Similarly, a reduction was obtained in settling time of both generator 1 and generator 2 at 4.94 s and 3.66 s compared to the system without PSS which was unstable.","doi":"10.1109/IICAIET51634.2021.9573534","pdfPath":"/iel7/9573499/9573533/09573534.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Engineering and Technology (IICAIET)","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Engineering and Technology (IICAIET)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IICAIET51634.2021.9573534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9573533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization for Tuning Power System Stabilizer towards Transient Stability Improvement in Power System Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9573534/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization for Tuning Power System Stabilizer towards Transient Stability Improvement in Power System Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2021","publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9573534/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle Swarm Optimization for Tuning Power System Stabilizer towards Transient Stability Improvement in Power System Network","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"paper_55.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061117S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9573499","isNumber":"9573533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9573499","xplore-issue":"9573533","articleId":"9573534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":9573539,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Abhishek","affiliation":["Birla Institute of Technology, Patna Campus, India"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Abhishek","id":"37088070998"},{"name":"Ankur Utsav","affiliation":["Birla Institute of Technology, Patna Campus, India"],"firstName":"Ankur","lastName":"Utsav","id":"37086359626"},{"name":"P.

for Fractional-Order with Delay Model of Twin Rotor MIMO System","abstract":"This paper aims at modelling of a twin rotor multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) system (TRMS) using fractional-order transfer function with time-delay. The modelling problem, defined as an optimization task, has been solved using a popular Nelder-Mead algorithm, also known as simplex search algorithm, which is one of the best algorithms for multi-dimensional unconstrained optimization without derivatives. The algorithm has been applied using the inbuilt \u201cfminsearch\u201d function in the MATLAB\u00ae software package. Further, FOMCON toolbox of MATLAB\u00ae has been employed to incorporate the effectiveness of the fractional-order derivative operators in characterizing the system behavior. Experimental simulation depicts that the proposed fractional-order with time delay model of the TRMS is resulting in significant improvement in the system representation with reduced error as compared to the conventional integer-order model with higher number of model parameters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9573561/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9573561/","publicationDate":"24 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Parameter Estimation for Fractional-Order with Delay Model of Twin Rotor MIMO System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter Estimation for Fractional-Order with Delay Model of Twin Rotor MIMO System","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"GUCON2021Paper0907.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068033S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9573501","isNumber":"9573519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9573501","xplore-issue":"9573519","articleId":"9573561","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":9573574,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

In earlier, radiologists have to manually identify the tumors from MRI images or other imaging types. That is both time consuming and threatening to the misclassification that could affect the recovery plan of a patient. Technological innovations and machine learning assist radiologists to detect tumors without invasive procedures. One of the machine learning algorithms that has been shown to be effective at image segmentation and classification is the convolutional neural network (CNN). In this proposed work, a novel CNN architecture was used on a publicly available figshare dataset to identify three brain tumor types. The proposed CNN architecture outperformed most state-of-the-art approaches, achieving a classification accuracy of 96.90 %. Precision, recall, and F1-score are some of the other evaluation metrics used in the study. In addition, the paper includes an in-depth analysis of misclassifications.","doi":"10.1109/IICAIET51634.2021.9573574","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Engineering and Technology (IICAIET)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9573499/9573533/09573574.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Engineering and Technology (IICAIET)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IICAIET51634.2021.9573574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9573533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Brain Tumor Classification from MRI Images Using Convolutional Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Technological innovation","Machine learning algorithms","Magnetic resonance imaging","Manuals","Machine learning","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Brain Tumor","CNN","Classification","MRI"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9573574/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Brain Tumor Classification from MRI Images Using Convolutional Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9573574/","publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2021","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Brain Tumor Classification from MRI Images Using Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"paper_30.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061601S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9573499","isNumber":"9573533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9573499","xplore-issue":"9573533","articleId":"9573574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":9573628,"authors":[{"name":"Adamu Lawan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Adamu","lastName":"Lawan","id":"37089010048"},{"name":"Muhammad Lawan","affiliation":["Directorate of ICT, Federal University, Gusau Zamfara, Nigeria"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Lawan","id":"37088546844"},{"name":"Ahmad Dikko Umar","affiliation":["Yusuf Maitama Sule University, Kano, Nigeria"],"firstName":"Ahmad Dikko","lastName":"Umar","id":"37089008248"},{"name":"Abba Mukhtar Bala","affiliation":["Yusuf Maitama Sule University, Kano, Nigeria"],"firstName":"Abba Mukhtar","lastName":"Bala","id":"37089010859"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3559-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0254-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9573628","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":11},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Analytical models","Recurrent neural networks","Time series analysis","Weather forecasting","Predictive models","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ANN","time-series","prayer","LSTM","RNN","NAR","LM algorithm","BRNN algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9573628","abstract":"since the advancement of Artificial Neural Network (ANNs), many studies have been proposed in the past few decades for forecasting purposes. Time-series applications have been applied in areas such as stocks, electricity, and weather prediction. The role of time in conducting prayer cannot be over-emphasized. Muslims must perform each prayer at its stipulated time for it to be valid. But, overall these years, nothing has been done yet about prayer time prediction. In this paper, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models and Non-linear Autoregressive (NAR) models are utilized to exploit the use of time series application in Kano state prayer time prediction. The models mainly focus on collecting Kano state prayer times from prior years to predict future prayer times for three prayers (noon prayer, sunset prayer, and evening prayer). The LSTM training algorithm for the LSTM model, the Bayesian Regularization Neural Network (BRNN) algorithm, and the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm for the NAR model were the state-of-the-art algorithms used in training the models. After that, a comprehensive comparative analysis is conducted between the algorithms to determine the best performing algorithm. Finally, the models were tested with a dataset from the Kano state shari'ah commission for prayer time from 2013\u20132020, for three prayers (noon prayer, sunset prayer, and evening prayer). The accuracy of the result shows that LSTM and NAR models could be applied to prayer time prediction and obtain decent accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/RTEICT52294.2021.9573628","startPage":"906","endPage":"911","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Recent Trends on Electronics, Information, Communication & Technology (RTEICT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTEICT52294.2021.9573628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9573517","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Recent Trends on Electronics, Information, Communication & Technology (RTEICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9573500/9573517/09573628.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Long Short Term Memory and Non-linear Autoregressive Models for Prayer Time Prediction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9573628/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Long Short Term Memory and Non-linear Autoregressive Models for Prayer Time Prediction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9573628/","publicationDate":"27 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","conferenceDate":"27-28 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Aug. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long Short Term Memory and Non-linear Autoregressive Models for Prayer Time Prediction","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"173_CRP_270.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040186S","chronDate":"27-28 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9573500","isNumber":"9573517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9573500","xplore-issue":"9573517","articleId":"9573628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":9573654,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Zhu","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Tongren Polytechnic College, Tong Ren, China","Faculty of Engineering, Modelling, Simulation & Computing Laboratory, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37089010781"},{"name":"Min Keng Tan","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Modelling, Simulation & Computing Laboratory, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Min Keng","lastName":"Tan","id":"37853110000"},{"name":"Renee Ka Yin Chin","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Modelling, Simulation & Computing Laboratory, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Renee Ka Yin","lastName":"Chin","id":"37085404129"},{"name":"Bih Lii Chua","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Modelling, Simulation & Computing Laboratory, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Bih Lii","lastName":"Chua","id":"38236503400"},{"name":"Xiaoxi Hao","affiliation":["Wuyi University, Jiangmen, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoxi","lastName":"Hao","id":"37088373208"},{"name":"Kenneth Tze Kin Teo","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Modelling, Simulation & Computing Laboratory, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Kenneth Tze Kin","lastName":"Teo","id":"37404084600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2899-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2900-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9573654","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":19},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Training","Simulation","Neural networks","Estimation","Probabilistic logic","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Probabilistic Neural Network","engine fault diagnosis","Parzen Window estimation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9573654","abstract":"Engine failure is one of the major factors caused vehicle breakdown.

The benign and malignant lesions can be differentiated with their shape, texture and color features. In this paper, melanoma skin cancer detection is done by the classification of benign and malignant skin lesions from dermoscopic images. These dermoscopic images are preprocessed and then the required part of the image is obtained by segmentation. The statistical texture features and shape features are extracted from the segmented image. These extracted features are provided as input to several classifiers and the classification of benign and malignant skin lesions has been done. As a result, the melanoma skin cancer is detected from the dermoscopic image.

In this paper, the performance of beamforming has been simulated for varying design parameters. 5th Generation (5G) data services will usher in the next generation of mobile networks. Speeds of more than 10 Gbps will be possible with the 5G system. In order to implement this super data rate, a few major problems must be solved. Beam forming is one of them, basically to direct the beam in a particular direction towards the intended user. This project involves designing an antenna array and testing it using a channel model to achieve beam formation. The main goal is to increase the obtained power by making the beam more energy efficient. The antenna is designed as a rectangular microstrip patch antenna array with unique design parameters to improve beam directivity, F/B ratio, received power, and its overall efficiency. This research shows that as the number of antenna elements increase and design parameters are optimized the directivity, F/B ratio, and received power improve.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9573748/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"27 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9573748/","conferenceDate":"27-28 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficient Beamforming for 5G","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficient Beamforming for 5G","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"177_CRP_27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058315S","chronDate":"27-28 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9573500","isNumber":"9573517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9573500","xplore-issue":"9573517","articleId":"9573748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":9573765,"authors":[{"name":"Sofia.D Sumithra","affiliation":["Electronics and communication Engineering, SRM College of Science and Technology, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Sofia.D","lastName":"Sumithra","id":"37089011514"},{"name":"Edward.A Shirly","affiliation":["Electronics and communication Engineering, SRM College of Science and Technology, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Edward.A","lastName":"Shirly","id":"37089011414"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9951-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9950-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9952-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9573765","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":8},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9573765","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Power demand","Heuristic algorithms","Conferences","Force","Dynamics","Genetics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic spectrum sharing","4G-LTE","5G-NR","Brute force algorithm","Multi objective Genetic optimization algorithm","Interweave Mode"]}],"doi":"10.1109/GUCON50781.2021.9573765","pdfPath":"/iel7/9573501/9573519/09573765.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 4th International Conference on Computing, Power and Communication Technologies (GUCON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 4th International Conference on Computing, Power and Communication Technologies (GUCON)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9573519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GUCON50781.2021.9573765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interweave Dynamic Spectrum Sharing for Cognitive Adhoc Networks usingGenetic Optimization Algorithm","abstract":"Interweave Dynamic spectrum sharing is adistributive opportunistic spectrum access for wireless users to access the spectrum any time dynamically.

In comparison with fixed tuning, such dynamic nature of the PI controllers is found to provide improved transient as well as steady state responses during set point tracking and load recovery phases. To enhance the closed Loop performance optimization technique is employed to obtain the suitable values of the tuning parameters.

The proposed method employs a YoLo technique to recognise the objects like face masks in pictures and videos as a measure for COVID-19 precaution. Extensive testing on datasets and performance assessment of the suggested approaches are demonstrated. Furthermore, we used a symbolic method to successfully maintain inter and intra class differences in face mask detection. The proposed work is being created as a prototype to monitor temperature and identify masks for individuals. The first technique employs a temperature sensor to detect the body's current temperature. In the second way, the work is aimed at offering a safety mechanism for individuals in order to avoid COVID-19.

Due to the non-linear characteristics, PV system will exhibit multiple peaks when the PV array receives non-uniform irradiance. As such, the conventional perturb and observe (P&O) MPPT controller will be trapped at local maximum power point (MPP). Therefore, this paper aims to integrate ANN into MPPT controller to improve the effectiveness of the MPPT controller in tracking the global MPP. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested under uniform and non-uniform irradiance conditions, and the performances are compared with the conventional P&O. The simulation results show the proposed method able to track the global MPP even the PV system exhibits multiple peaks under non-uniform condition, whereas the conventional P&O is trapped at local MPP. Thus, the proposed algorithm is able to harvest much energy as compared to the conventional method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9573886/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9573886/","publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimization of Photovoltaic Energy Harvesting using Artificial Neural Network","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006242","fundingName":"Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS)","grantNumber":"GUG0459-1/2020"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of Photovoltaic Energy Harvesting using Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"paper_86.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060991S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9573499","isNumber":"9573533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9573499","xplore-issue":"9573533","articleId":"9573886","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":9573925,"authors":[{"name":"Mohua Biswas","affiliation":["Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology (RUET), Rajshahi, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Mohua","lastName":"Biswas","id":"37089014924"},{"name":"Shuvra Prokash Biswas","affiliation":["Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology (RUET), Rajshahi, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Shuvra Prokash","lastName":"Biswas","id":"37086323691"},{"name":"Md.

From the last decade, converting the variable solar dc power to constant ac power has become a challenge. This paper underpins a novel three phase transformer-less grid connected photovoltaic inverter with the control blocks applicable for all types of grid voltage ranges. This novel three-phase inverter topology not only contains very lower reduced leakage current as well as less total harmonic distortion (THD) but also improved power quality. Filter clamping approach has been owned to eliminate extra leakage current through the ground path. Besides unipolar sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM) method has been used to control the power switches. As a result, the common mode voltage has been held to constant, which is also responsible for reducing leakage current to 25.42 mA. The leakage current suppression has been analyzed in details with simulation results. The switches did not affect the efficiency of this inverter so much but reduced the leakage current. Switching losses and conduction losses are very low. The THD of Grid voltage of this proposed topology is recorded 0.94% likewise, grid current THD is measured as 0.42%. To check the performance of this proposed inverter more accurately, input voltage as well as load amount of this inverter have been changed instantly in the middle of simulation. This topology has been implemented and tested via MATLAB/Simulink platform.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9573925/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9573925/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","publicationDate":"24 Sept. 2021","accessionNumber":"21274022","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A New Three-Phase High Performance H8 Filter Clamped Transformer-less Inverter for Grid-tied Photovoltaic Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Three-Phase High Performance H8 Filter Clamped Transformer-less Inverter for Grid-tied Photovoltaic Systems","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"GUCON2021Paper1374.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08316S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9573501","isNumber":"9573519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9573501","xplore-issue":"9573519","articleId":"9573925","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9573934,"authors":[{"name":"Kit Guan Lim","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Modelling, Simulation & Computing Laboratory, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Kit Guan","lastName":"Lim","id":"37085586361"},{"name":"Chii Soon Huong","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Modelling, Simulation & Computing Laboratory, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Chii Soon","lastName":"Huong","id":"37089008921"},{"name":"Min Keng Tan","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Modelling, Simulation & Computing Laboratory, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Min Keng","lastName":"Tan","id":"37853110000"},{"name":"Chung Fan Liau","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Modelling, Simulation & Computing Laboratory, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Chung Fan","lastName":"Liau","id":"37088423138"},{"name":"Min Yang","affiliation":["School of Intelligent Manufacturing, Wuyi University, Jiangmen, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086616200"},{"name":"Kenneth Tze Kin Teo","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Modelling, Simulation & Computing Laboratory, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Kenneth Tze Kin","lastName":"Teo","id":"37404084600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2899-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2900-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9573934","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":9},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9573934","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Deep learning","Convolution","Neural networks","Crops","Convolutional neural networks","Monitoring"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["convolution neural network","deep learning","image processing","classification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IICAIET51634.2021.9573934","pdfPath":"/iel7/9573499/9573533/09573934.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Engineering and Technology (IICAIET)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Engineering and Technology (IICAIET)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9573533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IICAIET51634.2021.9573934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of Crop Disease Classification using Convolution Neural Network","abstract":"This paper presents the deep learning model by Convolution Neural Network (CNN) in training the crop disease classifier via image classification.

Object detection is a technology related to computer vision and image processing that allows us to detect instances of certain classes. There are numerous applications like robotics, autonomous driving and augmented reality. A bounding box often defines the region of interest and then is used to classify into respective categories. Due to identical appearance and shape of various objects and the interference of lighting and shielding, object detection has always been a challenging problem in computer vision. Conventional 2D object detection yields four degrees of freedom axis-aligned bounding boxes with centre (x, y) and 2D size (w, h), the 3D bounding boxes generally have 6 Degrees of freedom: 3D physical size (w, h, l), 3D centre location (x, y, z). 2D object detection and tracking methods do not provide depth information to perform essential tasks in various computer vision applications. One among them is the Autonomous driving. 3D object detection includes depth information that provides more information on the structure of detected object. More information is required to make decisions accurately in different fields where 3D object detection and tracking can be applied. In this paper various 3D object detection and tracking methods are elaborated for various computer vision applications, this includes various fields such as robotics, driving, space field and also in the military.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9573517","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTEICT52294.2021.9573964","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Recent Trends on Electronics, Information, Communication & Technology (RTEICT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Recent Trends on Electronics, Information, Communication & Technology (RTEICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9573500/9573517/09573964.pdf","startPage":"735","endPage":"738","doi":"10.1109/RTEICT52294.2021.9573964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D Object Detection and Tracking Methods using Deep Learning for Computer Vision Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"3D Object Detection and Tracking Methods using Deep Learning for Computer Vision Applications","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-28 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9573964/","publicationDate":"27 Aug. 2021","accessionNumber":"21273276","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9573964/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D Object Detection and Tracking Methods using Deep Learning for Computer Vision Applications","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"137_CRP_104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049121S","chronDate":"27-28 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9573500","isNumber":"9573517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9573500","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"9573517","articleId":"9573964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9573968,"authors":[{"name":"R Aparna","affiliation":["M S Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bengaluru, India"],"firstName":"R","lastName":"Aparna","id":"37399766100"},{"name":"Shilpa Chaudhari","affiliation":["M S Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bengaluru, India"],"firstName":"Shilpa","lastName":"Chaudhari","id":"37085416612"},{"name":"Kapsha Roshan Singh","affiliation":["M S Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bengaluru, India"],"firstName":"Kapsha Roshan","lastName":"Singh","id":"37089008506"},{"name":"Fayaz Ahmed Mohammad","affiliation":["M S Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bengaluru, India"],"firstName":"Fayaz Ahmed","lastName":"Mohammad","id":"37089007783"},{"name":"Manish Padmannavar","affiliation":["M S Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bengaluru, India"],"firstName":"Manish","lastName":"Padmannavar","id":"37089009637"},{"name":"Varra Charishma","affiliation":["M S Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bengaluru, India"],"firstName":"Varra","lastName":"Charishma","id":"37089010573"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3559-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0254-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9573968","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":14},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Text recognition","Object detection","Speech recognition","Speech enhancement","User experience","Libraries","Videos"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["YOLOv3","ImageAI","Keras","TensorFlow","bounded boxes","object detection","video analysis","smart chef"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9573968","abstract":"With the boom in internet usage every aspect of our daily lives has experienced a drastic change over a period of time.

CNN is extensively used in the area of image recognition and object detection for classification purposes. CNN is composed of several layers of filters to get feature maps of input data, yet foremost and crucial one is convolutional layer, hence the name Convolutional neural networks. However, the growth of quantum computing and quantum neural network in deep learning is limited. Three main obstacles that limit the growth of these are, first is due to the lack of real-time quantum computers to experiment with. Second is the improper training algorithms and at last, non-linearity nature of the neural networks. This paper introduces a novel approach to begin one's journey in quantum computing, along with solutions and developments. This work provides a detailed description of architectures, frameworks and algorithms used for implementing a QCNN model. The research was made regarding image recognition and object detection using QCNN and found that QCNN can increase the computational speeds with better performance metrics compared to classical computational methods. This paper also debates about applications of QCNN in computer vision, signal and image processing, Pharmaceuticals, Cryptography and various other fields. This study also explains Key players and future work in developing quantum computers, quantum computing algorithms, software and hardware support to implement QCNN in various applications.","doi":"10.1109/RTEICT52294.2021.9574030","startPage":"728","endPage":"734","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Recent Trends on Electronics, Information, Communication & Technology (RTEICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9573500/9573517/09574030.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Recent Trends on Electronics, Information, Communication & Technology (RTEICT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTEICT52294.2021.9574030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9573517","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN) Using Deep Learning for Computer Vision Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Computers","Training","Computer vision","Quantum computing","Image recognition","Neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN)","Computer Vision","FPGA","Video Surveillance","Deep Learning","Machine Learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9574030/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN) Using Deep Learning for Computer Vision Applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9574030/","publicationDate":"27 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2021","conferenceDate":"27-28 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN) Using Deep Learning for Computer Vision Applications","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"136_CRP_103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053631S","chronDate":"27-28 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9573500","isNumber":"9573517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9573500","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"9573517","articleId":"9574030","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":9574031,"authors":[{"name":"Navin Nadar","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications, St. Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Navin","lastName":"Nadar","id":"37089010746"},{"name":"Moksha Mehta","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications, St. Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Moksha","lastName":"Mehta","id":"37089007233"},{"name":"Kaushal Bhat","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications, St. Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Kaushal","lastName":"Bhat","id":"37089010472"},{"name":"Joshua Mendes","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications, St. Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Joshua","lastName":"Mendes","id":"37089007163"},{"name":"Ravindra Chaudhari","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications, St. Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Ravindra","lastName":"Chaudhari","id":"37086644900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3559-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0254-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9574031","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":13},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","Pipelines","Signal processing algorithms","Computer architecture","Signal processing","Very large scale integration","Throughput"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Polyphase decomposition","FFT","MDC architecture","Pipeline architecture","Computational complexity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9574031","abstract":"FFT is the fundamental unit of any signal processing system. Performance characteristics like speed, computational complexity and power consumption are dependent on FFT calculation. Optimizing FFT algorithm plays a significant role in optimizing the signal processing system. Hardware implementation of FFT follows a strict mathematical sense and hence has many problems with its VLSI realization. This paper presents the implementation of FFT algorithm based on pipeline architecture using the polyphase decomposition concept. The proposed architecture is designed to reduce the computational complexity and at the same time not compromising the speed of the overall DSP system. Polyphase decomposition is used to segment the long input sequence into P sub sequences by using decimation factor \u2018P\u2019. The FFT of these segmented sequences is computed serially by using pipelined Radix-2 MDC architecture with higher throughput rate. Finally, results are combined to get complete FFT of original sequence by using (P-1) adders and multipliers. In addition to this, the proposed architecture also allows the calculation of any \u201ceven-length\u201d point FFT within a specified range which depends on the decimating factor. The computational complexity is reduced by a large factor when compared with the existing FFT algorithms. The use of MDC architecture ensures higher throughput compared to other existing architectures. The proposed architecture is more efficient than existing in terms of throughput rate and maximum clock frequency.","doi":"10.1109/RTEICT52294.2021.9574031","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTEICT52294.2021.9574031","startPage":"339","endPage":"343","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Recent Trends on Electronics, Information, Communication & Technology (RTEICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9573500/9573517/09574031.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Recent Trends on Electronics, Information, Communication & Technology (RTEICT)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9573517","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware Implementation of Pipelined FFT using Polyphase Decomposition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Hardware Implementation of Pipelined FFT using Polyphase Decomposition","conferenceDate":"27-28 Aug. 2021","publicationDate":"27 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9574031/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9574031/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware Implementation of Pipelined FFT using Polyphase Decomposition","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"63_CRP_256.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065392S","chronDate":"27-28 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9573500","isNumber":"9573517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9573500","xplore-issue":"9573517","articleId":"9574031","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9574035,"authors":[{"name":"Jinu Lilly Joseph","affiliation":["Saintgits College of Engineering, Kottayam, India"],"firstName":"Jinu Lilly","lastName":"Joseph","id":"37089018110"},{"name":"Santhosh P.

Thus a system to assist the blind in recognizing the facial expressions of the confronting person can be of great use. A facial expression recognition system was developed using the convolutional neural network methodology in deep learning. Two models were created for the same. The first model was a proposed CNN architecture trained using FER-2013 dataset. The model could classify the expressions into 7 different classes and obtained an accuracy of 67.18%. The second model was based on transfer learning approach trained using cleansed FER-2013 dataset. The model could classify the expressions into 4 different classes and obtained an accuracy of 75.55%. The optimized model of the original transfer learning model was created and deployed on the android device. The model can capture the image of the other person and provide the corresponding class label of expression. The classified text will be then converted to speech for assisting the blind.","doi":"10.1109/GUCON50781.2021.9574035","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 4th International Conference on Computing, Power and Communication Technologies (GUCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9573501/9573519/09574035.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 4th International Conference on Computing, Power and Communication Technologies (GUCON)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GUCON50781.2021.9574035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9573519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Facial Expression Recognition for the Blind Using Deep Learning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Emotion recognition","Image recognition","Text recognition","Face recognition","Conferences","Transfer learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["facial expression recognition","convolutional neural network","transfer learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9574035/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Facial Expression Recognition for the Blind Using Deep Learning","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9574035/","publicationDate":"24 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Facial Expression Recognition for the Blind Using Deep Learning","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"GUCON2021Paper1112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046256S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9573501","isNumber":"9573519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9573501","xplore-issue":"9573519","articleId":"9574035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":9574048,"authors":[{"name":"Junaid Farooq","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology Srinagar, Srinagar, India"],"firstName":"Junaid","lastName":"Farooq","id":"37089209208"},{"name":"Mohammad Abid Bazaz","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology Srinagar, Srinagar, India"],"firstName":"Mohammad Abid","lastName":"Bazaz","id":"37946132500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1559-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4699-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9574048","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Adaptation models","Adaptive systems","Brushless DC motors","Simulation","Velocity control","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","brushless DC motors","control system synthesis","fuzzy control","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","nonlinear systems","self-adjusting systems","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conventional tuning methods","PID controller","speed control","online self-tuning","deep learning based self-tuning algorithm","system processing time","loop delays","controller parameters","time-series","latent variables","adaptive learning","DNN features","algorithm design","highly nonlinear systems","sensitive systems","stochastic systems","data-based control","model-free","physics-informed","two-dimensional multilayered deep neural network","control systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep Learning","Recurrent Neural Network","Intelligent Control","Adaptive Control","Predictive Control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9574048","abstract":"This paper proposes an innovative two-dimensional multi-layered deep neural network (DNN) to achieve adaptive, physics-informed, model-free and data-based control of stochastic, sensitive and highly nonlinear systems.

Human Activity Recognition is the process of predicting what a person is doing based on the traces of their movement. We propose using deep recurrent neural networks (DRNNs) for building recognition models capable of capturing long-range dependencies in variable-length input sequences. We present unidirectional, bidirectional, and cascaded architectures based on long short-term memory (LSTM), DRNNs and evaluate their effectiveness on various benchmark datasets. Long shortterm memory (LSTM) is an artificial deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) architecture used in deep learning, especially for time series prediction. It can process single data points (such as images) and entire data sequences (such as speech or video). LSTM networks are well-suited for classifying, processing, and making predictions based on time series data since there can be lags of unknown duration between essential events in a time series in real-time. We proposed Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using a smartphone dataset and LSTM. Compared to a classical approach, using Deep Recurrent Neural Networks (DRNN) with Long Short-Term Memory cells (LSTMs) require no or almost no feature engineering. Data can be fed directly into the neural network, which acts as a black box, modeling the problem correctly. This means that the neural networks are almost always able to identify the movement type correctly.

The anomaly detection helps to predict the abnormal load usage of a consumer. Usually, the classification method used in anomaly detection. This research paper proposed to identify the potential anomaly points by using threshold and outliers. The prediction in time-series applied Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm. The historical electricity load dataset of a single industrial consumer was used to generate the prediction of electricity load. There were five optimizers used to produce the model: Adam, Adadelta, Adagrad, RMSProp, and Stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The prediction model was evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The best model among all five models was generated by Adadelta optimizer with the error rate value of 0.091982 for MSE and 0.018433 for MAE. The prediction values were generated by this model.

Academics and practitioners have examined a variety of techniques for predicting stock price movement. Artificial intelligence models have attracted many researchers interested in financial forecasting in the stock market. This paper investigates the use of commodity prices and exchange rates to predict the KLCI index price one day ahead using the NARX-ANN model. The methodology employs various experiments on the sample dataset using various exogenous variables and neural training algorithms. The model's prediction performance using four input variables (three commodity prices and the exchange rate) is compared with the model's prediction performance when only the KLCI price data with price lags is used as input variables. The model's performance shows promising results in terms of error rate and hit rate. However, using commodity prices and exchange rate combinations did not improve the model's short-term next-day prediction of the KLCI price.","doi":"10.1109/AiDAS53897.2021.9574394","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Data Sciences (AiDAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9574041/9574130/09574394.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Data Sciences (AiDAS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AiDAS53897.2021.9574394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9574130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A NARX Neural Network Model To Predict One-Day Ahead Movement of The Stock Market Index of Malaysia","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Exchange rates","Oils","Input variables","Neural networks","Predictive models","Data models","Macroeconomics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NARX","stock market","prediction","neural network","commodity prices","exchange rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9574394/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A NARX Neural Network Model To Predict One-Day Ahead Movement of The Stock Market Index of Malaysia","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9574394/","publicationDate":"8 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","conferenceDate":"8-9 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008561","fundingName":"Universiti Tenaga Nasional","grantNumber":"RJO10517844/016"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A NARX Neural Network Model To Predict One-Day Ahead Movement of The Stock Market Index of Malaysia","confLoc":"IPOH, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"AiDAS2021__063_062.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105321S","chronDate":"8-9 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9574041","isNumber":"9574130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9574041","xplore-issue":"9574130","articleId":"9574394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9574458,"authors":[{"name":"ZhiHao Zhou","affiliation":["Zhejiang Energy Group R&D Institute Co., Ltd, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"ZhiHao","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37089007773"},{"name":"YuWei Meng","affiliation":["Zhejiang Energy Group R&D Institute Co., Ltd, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"YuWei","lastName":"Meng","id":"37088664321"},{"name":"RongDong Yu","affiliation":["Zhejiang Energy Group R&D Institute Co., Ltd, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"RongDong","lastName":"Yu","id":"37088444747"},{"name":"Tao Yang","affiliation":["Zhejiang Energy Group R&D Institute Co., Ltd, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Yang","id":"37089009567"},{"name":"Ding Lu","affiliation":["Zhejiang Energy Group R&D Institute Co., Ltd, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Ding","lastName":"Lu","id":"37089008973"},{"name":"Zhan Wang","affiliation":["Zhejiang Energy Group R&D Institute Co., Ltd, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089007862"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3881-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3880-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4612-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9574458","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9574458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Yolov5s based Real-time Spontaneous Combustion Point Detection Method","abstract":"The spontaneous combustion of coal pile is very easy to cause fires, especially in the closed coal yards. Early detection and disposal of spontaneous-combustion-point (SCP) could avoid large losses. However, the traditional SCP detection methods are confronted with problem of hysteresis, and cannot effectively detect the small SCP in early stage. This paper proposes a novel detection method based on Yolov5s, by using \u201cFPN+ PAN\u201d in the Neck layer to enhance the SCP expressions. To improve the performance of the model in learning the characteristic of small SCP, the block labeling approach is applied in the labeling process. In addition, TensorRT is adopted to accelerate the forward inference of the model, and the deployment test is carried out on Jetson nano. Through comparative analysis, the proposed method outperforms yolov3s and yolov4s in detecting the SCP in very early stage (smoke or flame), and achieves 7 FPS speed in real-time video stream.","doi":"10.1109/CEI52496.2021.9574458","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Computer Science, Electronic Information Engineering and Intelligent Control Technology (CEI)","startPage":"213","endPage":"218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEI52496.2021.9574458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9574447","pdfPath":"/iel7/9574103/9574447/09574458.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Computer Science, Electronic Information Engineering and Intelligent Control Technology (CEI)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fires","Process control","Coal","Life estimation","Streaming media","Real-time systems","Combustion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SCP","image processing","block labeling","Yolov5s","target detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Yolov5s based Real-time Spontaneous Combustion Point Detection Method","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9574458/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9574458/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2021","publicationDate":"24 Sept. 2021","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Yolov5s based Real-time Spontaneous Combustion Point Detection Method","confLoc":"Fuzhou, China","sourcePdf":"52496_ART213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075712S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9574103","isNumber":"9574447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9574103","xplore-issue":"9574447","articleId":"9574458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9574491,"authors":[{"name":"Yuhan Dai","affiliation":["College of Letters and Science, University of California, Davis, Davis, United States"],"firstName":"Yuhan","lastName":"Dai","id":"37089010268"},{"name":"Tong Xin","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering and Science, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Xin","id":"37089010911"},{"name":"Yihao Zheng","affiliation":["College of Letters and Science, University of California, Davis, Davis, United States"],"firstName":"Yihao","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37089009195"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3881-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3880-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4612-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9574491","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Training","Computer science","Analytical models","Conferences","Computational modeling","Generative adversarial networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["deep learning","music generation","Generative Adversarial Networks","Long Short-Term Memory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9574491","abstract":"Music exerts an essential role in human beings' daily life.

However, the system's excessively high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) will cause signal distortion and affect the channel estimation performance when passing through the power amplifier at the transmitting end. Aiming to reduce the high PAPR of the system, the improved Interference Cancellation Method with phase rotation (I-ICM) is proposed. I-ICM generates different phase sequences, which are multiplied with transmission data to obtain different Data sequences and calculate its PAPR, respectively, and then select the group with the lowest PAPR for transmission. It is verified by simulation that I-ICM can reduce the high PAPR of the system, the bit error rate (BER) is reduced, and the channel estimation performance is not significantly lower compared with ICM.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Interference Cancellation Method in FBMC/OQAM system on PAPR reduction","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Computer Science, Electronic Information Engineering and Intelligent Control Technology (CEI)","doi":"10.1109/CEI52496.2021.9574528","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Computer Science, Electronic Information Engineering and Intelligent Control Technology (CEI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9574103/9574447/09574528.pdf","startPage":"790","endPage":"794","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEI52496.2021.9574528","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9574447","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9574528","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9574528/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Improved Interference Cancellation Method in FBMC/OQAM system on PAPR reduction","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9574528/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2021","publicationDate":"24 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Interference Cancellation Method in FBMC/OQAM system on PAPR reduction","confLoc":"Fuzhou, China","sourcePdf":"52496_ART790.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072608S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9574103","isNumber":"9574447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9574103","xplore-issue":"9574447","articleId":"9574528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9574533,"authors":[{"name":"Haoyue Yan","affiliation":["University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Haoyue","lastName":"Yan","id":"37088843804"},{"name":"Yongqiang Ma","affiliation":["Brain-Machine Mixed ICs Development Research Center of Brain-Machine Intelligence, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yongqiang","lastName":"Ma","id":"37089008595"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3881-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3880-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4612-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9574533","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Power demand","Computational modeling","Neural networks","Tools","Parallel processing","Throughput"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional Neural Network","VGG16","FPGA","Accelerator","Memory"]}],"abstract":"At present, the convolutional layer is a key component of the neural network. With the development of convolutional recognition technology, more and more models have increased the depth of the internal convolutional layer through time iteration and are committed to more extensive and more characteristic inputs. With a large number of information input units, the computing power of the hardware needs to make up for the efficiency and cost of the algorithm. However, most of the models developed by research are based on the traditional single hardware platform, and constantly test its performance limits. Therefore, we tested and developed a hybrid hardware platform, while expanding its performance parallelism, throughput capacity, and limitations on storage bit width. We use the ZYNQ-7100 platform to test the feasibility of the proposed hardware structure for the deeper convolutional structure VGG16 and compare the power consumption of other non-configurable platforms. The tested digital architecture finally has extremely obvious advantages and provides reliable configuration capabilities to make our experiments declared successful in terms of algorithms and structures.","doi":"10.1109/CEI52496.2021.9574533","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Computer Science, Electronic Information Engineering and Intelligent Control Technology (CEI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Computer Science, Electronic Information Engineering and Intelligent Control Technology (CEI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9574103/9574447/09574533.pdf","startPage":"274","endPage":"278","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEI52496.2021.9574533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9574447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Reconfigurable Heterogeneous Computing-Hardware Design With Aimed VGG16 Acceleration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9574533","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9574533/","displayDocTitle":"A Reconfigurable Heterogeneous Computing-Hardware Design With Aimed VGG16 Acceleration","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"24 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9574533/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Reconfigurable Heterogeneous Computing-Hardware Design With Aimed VGG16 Acceleration","confLoc":"Fuzhou, China","sourcePdf":"52496_ART274.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034719S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9574103","isNumber":"9574447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9574103","xplore-issue":"9574447","articleId":"9574533","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-03"},{"_id":9574589,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyu Gao","affiliation":["School of Information and Manage, Beijing Information Science & Technology University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyu","lastName":"Gao","id":"37089009208"},{"name":"Xiaoyong Zhao","affiliation":["School of Information and Manage, China Information Systems Institute, Beijing Information Science & Technology University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyong","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086743102"},{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["School of Information and Manage, China Information Systems Institute, Beijing Information Science & Technology University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089011303"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3881-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3880-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4612-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9574589","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Time series analysis","Memory management","Prototypes","Memory modules","Detectors","Logic gates"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly Detection","Variational auto-encoder","Memory Network"]}],"abstract":"Anomaly detection is of great importance due to its wide application in industrial areas. Deep auto-encoders have enabled significant advances in anomaly detection over the past decade. However, it has been observed that sometimes the auto-encoder are likely to reconstruct anomalies due to the \u201cexcellent\u201d generalization ability, resulting in the miss detection of anomalies. To mitigate this deficiency, scholars have proposed the memory-augmented deep auto-encoder method recently. However, more recent work on memory-augmented uses continuous memory representations or key-values pairs in memory for read/write without forgetting mechanism, and it is assumed that data such as early access to the network are normal data. To deal with those imperfectness, we present a VAE-based memory-augmented network with a trained memory network: MEMVAE, addressing scheme to provide a strong guarantee to detect anomalous. In particular, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) cells are employed as the encoder and decoder to capture latent temporal structure. We then train an external memory module that records common patterns of the prototype. In addition, we present a weighted regular score that simply updates our memory entries. Our detector reports a reconstruction probability as the anomaly score. Experimental results on tabular data and time series data show that MEMVAE demonstrates significant improvements and better performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memory Augmented Variational Auto-Encoder for Anomaly Detection","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Computer Science, Electronic Information Engineering and Intelligent Control Technology (CEI)","doi":"10.1109/CEI52496.2021.9574589","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Computer Science, Electronic Information Engineering and Intelligent Control Technology (CEI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9574103/9574447/09574589.pdf","startPage":"728","endPage":"732","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEI52496.2021.9574589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9574447","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9574589","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9574589/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Memory Augmented Variational Auto-Encoder for Anomaly Detection","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9574589/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2021","publicationDate":"24 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memory Augmented Variational Auto-Encoder for Anomaly Detection","confLoc":"Fuzhou, China","sourcePdf":"52496_ART728.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055032S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9574103","isNumber":"9574447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9574103","xplore-issue":"9574447","articleId":"9574589","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9574663,"authors":[{"name":"Gaurav Soni","affiliation":["Apex Institute of Technology (CSE-AIT), Chandigarh University, Mohali, Chandigarh, Punjab, India"],"firstName":"Gaurav","lastName":"Soni","id":"37975818500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7696-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7697-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7555"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2375-8244"}],"articleNumber":"9574663","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Couplings","Optical diffraction","Transmitting antennas","Optical fiber cables","Receiving antennas","Optical fiber networks","Optical fiber theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["space optical","OOK","FSO"]}],"abstract":"FSO is a terrestrial OWC system used for point-to-point communication and operates at near infrared (IR) frequencies (750\u20131600 nm).

For the same, it uses light sources and light detectors, i.e., laser diodes and photodiodes, respectively. The real motive behind using FSO is to do away with the cost, time, and effort in laying fiber optic cables without adversely impacting high data rates for transmitting voice, image, text, video, or any other file. In recent years, Free space based optical communication has developed and grown rapidly and has been widely used in applications like satellite laser based communication, radar detection, and other fields. Space optical communication based system includes a TX-RX antenna system and a coupling system. The research of space optical communication system often separates the antenna systems and the coupling system for discussion. When analyzing TX-RX antenna systems, geometric optics is generally used. Based on ancient diffraction theory, the performance of space optical communication systems consisting of a transmitter antenna, receiver antenna, and fiber coupling based systems are analyzed. Besides, several practical situations are also considered such as the defocusing of the TX-RX antenna and the deviation of the fiber. The longer or greater the transmission distance, the greater the effect of diffraction. When the transmission distance is short, the defocusing of the primary mirror will help it improve the transmission efficiency of the given system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Investigation of the Free Space Optics Link based Communication using DOE scheme at 1550nm","publicationTitle":"2021 13th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks (CICN)","doi":"10.1109/CICN51697.2021.9574663","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 13th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks (CICN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9574636/9574637/09574663.pdf","startPage":"108","endPage":"111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICN51697.2021.9574663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9574637","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9574663","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9574663/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Performance Investigation of the Free Space Optics Link based Communication using DOE scheme at 1550nm","conferenceDate":"22-23 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9574663/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","publicationDate":"22 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Investigation of the Free Space Optics Link based Communication using DOE scheme at 1550nm","confLoc":"Lima, Peru","sourcePdf":"2021cicn_108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041877S","chronDate":"22-23 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9574636","isNumber":"9574637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9574636","xplore-issue":"9574637","articleId":"9574663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9574668,"authors":[{"name":"Sashank Sridhar","affiliation":["College of Engineering Guindy, Anna University, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Sashank","lastName":"Sridhar","id":"37088460503"},{"name":"Sowmya Sanagavarapu","affiliation":["College of Engineering Guindy, Anna University, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Sowmya","lastName":"Sanagavarapu","id":"37088461305"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7696-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7697-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7555"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2375-8244"}],"articleNumber":"9574668","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":41},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Warranties","Industries","Heating systems","Machine learning algorithms","Tools","Predictive models","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","maintenance engineering","pattern classification","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SMOTE-based","defects","industrial machines","tool wear","power failure","machine learning algorithms","machine failures","predictive maintenance model","real-time failures","class data imbalance","SMOTE technique","nonfailure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SMOTE","Oversampling","Machine Failure","Failure Prediction","Data Imbalance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9574668","abstract":"The identification of failures and defects in industrial machines has proven to be a challenge to gauge their warranty and performance.

sensor networks, high speed trains, smart cities, and many more [9]. For such data intensive wireless communications, only radio frequency (RF) based wireless systems cannot meet the desired demands because RF band is susceptible to interference, has limited capacity, and requires a heavy license fee to use the spectrum [10]. Hence, other portions of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum and new technologies are required to be considered for fulfilling the demands of wireless communication systems in the near future. FSO, an OWe-based optical wireless communication system, is one such alternate option. Increased bandwidth demands may be met using free space optical communication or wireless optics, which are both last mile options. The FSO transmits and receives multimedia data using an LED or LASER beam as a high data rate optical link. FSO may be installed for a quarter of the cost of fibre, but communication between the transmitter and receiver must be Line of Sight (LOS). The FSO not only has many advantages but also hampered by some atmospheric conditions, which degrades the link performance. This paper reviews the FSO link design and effect of different atmospheric condition like- fog, scintillation, turbulence, rain etc. In this research paper, the simulation based on optsim to carry out the performance investigation FSO link in investigation by varying the FSO beam divergence angle is being carried out.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Investigation of Free Space Optics Link Using Beam Divergence","publicationTitle":"2021 13th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks (CICN)","doi":"10.1109/CICN51697.2021.9574693","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 13th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks (CICN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9574636/9574637/09574693.pdf","startPage":"102","endPage":"107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICN51697.2021.9574693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9574637","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9574693","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9574693/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Performance Investigation of Free Space Optics Link Using Beam Divergence","conferenceDate":"22-23 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9574693/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","publicationDate":"22 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Investigation of Free Space Optics Link Using Beam Divergence","confLoc":"Lima, Peru","sourcePdf":"2021cicn_102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040302S","chronDate":"22-23 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9574636","isNumber":"9574637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9574636","xplore-issue":"9574637","articleId":"9574693","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9574707,"authors":[{"name":"Jui-Chuan Cheng","affiliation":["National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jui-Chuan","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37089004597"},{"name":"Hsiu-Chin Peng","affiliation":["National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsiu-Chin","lastName":"Peng","id":"37089003960"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2307-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4631-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9574707","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9574707","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Technological innovation","Conferences","Air quality","Prediction algorithms","Market research","Mobile handsets","Pollution measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Long Short-Term Memory","Fuzzy Algorithm","Air Quality","Forecast","Evaluation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICKII51822.2021.9574707","pdfPath":"/iel7/9574698/9574659/09574707.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 4th International Conference on Knowledge Innovation and Invention (ICKII)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 4th International Conference on Knowledge Innovation and Invention (ICKII)","startPage":"88","endPage":"91","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9574659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICKII51822.2021.9574707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Air Quality Forecast and Evaluation Based on Long Short-Term Memory Network and Fuzzy Algorithm","abstract":"Accurate forecasting of air quality enables the public to formulate effective preventive measures in advance to maintain their health.

The method uses two parallel matching networks whose designs are de-coupled through the topology choice. The low-band matching network is constrained to consist of a shunt reactive element connected through quarter-wavelength transmission lines at the higher frequency. A shunt switch is placed in parallel to the matching reactance to enable isolation of this path from the high-frequency response when the switch is on. The architecture is demonstrated in a GaAs MMIC operating at C and K bands appropriate for a multi-function 5G transmitter. In CW operation at 5.8 / 22 GHz, the power amplifier achieves a power-added efficiency of 29.5 / 28 % with a corresponding output power of 20 / 20.5 % dBm and a single-stage gain of 8 / 6 dB.

The PA utilizes reconfigurable TLTs for output and input matching networks to reconfigure the PA between the n257 and n260 bands with optimal performance in both bands. The reconfigurable TLTs provide frequency reconfigurability to the PA by changing both the primary and secondary side inductances of the TLTs. The switches for the TLTs are located in the space inside the TLTs, which results in a small overall chip area. The dual-band PA is fabricated using a 28-nm bulk CMOS process. It achieves 20.2 and 19.1 dBm saturated output powers, 18.7 and 18.6 dBm 1-dB compressed output powers and 33.6% and 32% peak power added efficiencies at 26.5 and 37 GHz, respectively.

By leveraging the multiple input multiple output (MIMO) technique, a virtual array could be synthesized, which carries a larger aperture to provide improved spatial resolution to track the hand gestures in the spatial domain. The static position of the hand in 3D space can be tracked by digital beamforming (DBF) based on the virtual array. The motion trajectory of the action gestures can be obtained by tracking the temporal phase variation using radar interferometry. Combining spatial positioning and temporal motion tracking leads to the proposed 4D gesture sensing technique, which carries the merits of noncontact, high precision and good robustness. A series of experiments are carried out in both microwave anechoic chamber and office environments to validate the proposed technique. The experimental results show that the proposed technique performs well in sensing a variety of both macro gestures and millimeter-level micro gestures.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium (IMS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9574790/9574791/09574875.pdf","startPage":"462","endPage":"465","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium (IMS)","doi":"10.1109/IMS19712.2021.9574875","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMS19712.2021.9574875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9574791","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9574875","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 4D Gesture Sensing Technique based on Spatiotemporal Detection with a 60 GHz FMCW MIMO Radar","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Tracking","Radar detection","Radar","Gesture recognition","Radar tracking","Microwave theory and techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["radar sensing","millimeter-wave","MIMO","FMCW radar","gesture recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9574875/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-25 June 2021","displayDocTitle":"A 4D Gesture Sensing Technique based on Spatiotemporal Detection with a 60 GHz FMCW MIMO Radar","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9574875/","publicationDate":"7 June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","conferenceDate":"7-25 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2019YFB2204604"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61831016"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 4D Gesture Sensing Technique based on Spatiotemporal Detection with a 60 GHz FMCW MIMO Radar","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062768S","chronDate":"7-25 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9574790","isNumber":"9574791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9574790","xplore-issue":"9574791","articleId":"9574875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-06"},{"_id":9574877,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The distributed MIMO exhibits two times greater spatial multiplexing efficiency than a conventional collocated Massive MIMO and achieves the system throughput of 2.1 Gbps per 100 MHz summing simultaneous connected six users.","doi":"10.1109/IMS19712.2021.9574898","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium (IMS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium (IMS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9574790/9574791/09574898.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMS19712.2021.9574898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9574791","startPage":"541","endPage":"544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"28 GHz Distributed-MIMO Comprehensive Antenna Calibration for 5G Indoor Spatial Division Multiplex","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9574898","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"28 GHz Distributed-MIMO Comprehensive Antenna Calibration for 5G Indoor Spatial Division Multiplex","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-25 June 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9574898/","conferenceDate":"7-25 June 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"7 June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9574898/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"28 GHz Distributed-MIMO Comprehensive Antenna Calibration for 5G Indoor Spatial Division Multiplex","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0574.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056245S","chronDate":"7-25 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9574790","isNumber":"9574791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9574790","xplore-issue":"9574791","articleId":"9574898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-06"},{"_id":9574907,"authors":[{"name":"Kenneth E.

Analog-RF cancellation represents one of the few techniques that allows for the additional suppression of transmit noise and nonlinearities before the receiver input, but has lacked the tuning speed required to enable advanced IBFD applications. This paper discusses a novel tuning approach based on machine learning principles, and introduces the optimal neural network configuration that drastically enhances tuning speed. The statistical performance of a prototype canceller was measured over a 20 MHz bandwidth centered at 2.5 GHz, and averaged more than 30 dB of cancellation with only 9 tuning iterations. These results are additionally compared to a survey of previously-reported cancellers, and reveal that this unique tuning approach provides the fastest convergence speed to date.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9574907/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-25 June 2021","conferenceDate":"7-25 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"7 June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9574907/","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Tuning for Analog-RF Self-Interference Cancellation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Tuning for Analog-RF Self-Interference Cancellation","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0751.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049476S","chronDate":"7-25 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9574790","isNumber":"9574791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9574790","xplore-issue":"9574791","articleId":"9574907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":9574909,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Bohn","affiliation":["Institute of Radio Frequency Engineering and Electronics, KIT, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Bohn","id":"37086200461"},{"name":"Joachim Hebeler","affiliation":["Institute of Radio Frequency Engineering and Electronics, KIT, Germany"],"firstName":"Joachim","lastName":"Hebeler","id":"37088390905"},{"name":"Christian Koos","affiliation":["Institute of Photonics and Quantum Electronics, KIT, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Koos","id":"38019575900"},{"name":"Thomas Zwick","affiliation":["Institute of Radio Frequency Engineering and Electronics, KIT, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Zwick","id":"37273510500"},{"name":"Ahmet \u00c7a\u011fri Ulusoy","affiliation":["Institute of Radio Frequency Engineering and Electronics, KIT, Germany"],"firstName":"Ahmet \u00c7a\u011fri","lastName":"Ulusoy","id":"38581061000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0307-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3141-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2576-7216"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"9574909","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"abstract":"We present a comparison of two analog driver circuits for optical communication with integrated distributed PAM-4 power combination.

The sensor is constructed as an open-ended broadside-coupled-line section with a liquid channel between the strips. Applying differential excitation to the sensor leads to most of the associated electric field being enclosed within the channel, and thus high sensitivity on the measured samples' electrical properties is obtained. Therefore, the information about the tested liquid can be extracted solely from the one-port-differential reflection coefficient over a broad frequency range after calibration. A hybrid 3-D printing and laminate technology is employed for the realization of an exemplary sensor to ensure good electrical and mechanical performance.

The system also uses a genetic algorithm AI engine which assesses the radar IF and iteratively improves the parameters of the cancellation waveform injected at the receiver.","doi":"10.1109/IMS19712.2021.9574926","startPage":"811","endPage":"814","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium (IMS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMS19712.2021.9574926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9574791","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium (IMS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9574790/9574791/09574926.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Surface Cancellation in Wideband Ground Penetrating Radar Employing Genetic Algorithm AI for Waveform Synthesis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9574926/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Surface Cancellation in Wideband Ground Penetrating Radar Employing Genetic Algorithm AI for Waveform Synthesis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9574926/","publicationDate":"7 June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","conferenceDate":"7-25 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-25 June 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Surface Cancellation in Wideband Ground Penetrating Radar Employing Genetic Algorithm AI for Waveform Synthesis","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034756S","chronDate":"7-25 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9574790","isNumber":"9574791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9574790","xplore-issue":"9574791","articleId":"9574926","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9574934,"authors":[{"name":"Qing-Yi Jiang","affiliation":["National Central University, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Qing-Yi","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37089002466"},{"name":"Yo-Shen Lin","affiliation":["National Central University, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Yo-Shen","lastName":"Lin","id":"37279530800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0307-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3141-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2576-7216"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"9574934","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Semiconductor device measurement","Phase measurement","Transmission line matrix methods","Gallium arsenide","Measurement uncertainty","Switches"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Absorptive switch","beamformer","Butler matrix","bridged-T coil","slow-wave microstrip line"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 24-GHz Butler-Matrix-Based Switched Beamformer in GaAs","doi":"10.1109/IMS19712.2021.9574934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9574791","endPage":"537","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium (IMS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium (IMS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9574790/9574791/09574934.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMS19712.2021.9574934","startPage":"534","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9574934","abstract":"A 24-GHz switched beamformer in GaAs for a 4-element linear antenna array is proposed, which is composed of an absorptive SP4T switch and a 4\u00d74 Butler matrix.

The proposed optimization-oriented strategy consists of two sequential optimization phases: predicting the suitable HPA structure using a classification DNN and optimizing components values of the selected model using regression DNNs. In sizing design parameters two simultaneous regression DNNs are applied that are based on multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) and multi-objective pareto front using modified quicksort (PFUMQ) methods for optimizing efficiency and phase distortion, respectively. The proposed design method reduces the phase distortion without significantly worsening efficiency and gain performances in HPAs. The successive optimization method is fully automated giving rise to an electromagnetic (EM)-verified post-layout generation, and prepares an easy-of-use procedure with reduced dependency to designers' experiences. For validating the proposed method, a wideband HPA is optimized for 1-2.3 GHz range frequency. It reveals larger than 55% drain efficiency at 40 dBm output power, and around 40% phase variation reduction in the operation band.","doi":"10.1109/IMS19712.2021.9574937","startPage":"233","endPage":"236","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium (IMS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMS19712.2021.9574937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9574791","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium (IMS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9574790/9574791/09574937.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective Efficiency and Phase Distortion Optimizations for Automated Design of Power Amplifiers Through Deep Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9574937/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective Efficiency and Phase Distortion Optimizations for Automated Design of Power Amplifiers Through Deep Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9574937/","publicationDate":"7 June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","conferenceDate":"7-25 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-25 June 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective Efficiency and Phase Distortion Optimizations for Automated Design of Power Amplifiers Through Deep Neural Networks","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0372.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049406S","chronDate":"7-25 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9574790","isNumber":"9574791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9574790","xplore-issue":"9574791","articleId":"9574937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":9574940,"authors":[{"name":"Tushar Sharma","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors, Chandler, Arizona, USA"],"firstName":"Tushar","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37085486636"},{"name":"Ning Zhu","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors, Chandler, Arizona, USA"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086133067"},{"name":"Jeffrey Roberts","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors, Chandler, Arizona, USA"],"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Roberts","id":"37086538579"},{"name":"Damon H Holmes","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors, Chandler, Arizona, USA"],"firstName":"Damon H","lastName":"Holmes","id":"37086029592"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0307-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3141-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2576-7216"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"9574940","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Base stations","Wires","Prototypes","Bandwidth","Power system harmonics","Harmonic analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["broadband","input harmonic","gallium nitride (GaN)","harmonic termination","inverse class F","integrated passive device (IPD)","power amplifier","high power","power density","integrated passive device"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9574940","doi":"10.1109/IMS19712.2021.9574940","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMS19712.2021.9574940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9574791","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium (IMS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium (IMS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9574790/9574791/09574940.pdf","startPage":"729","endPage":"731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Continuous Inverse Class F Power Amplifier for High Power 5G Macro Base Station Application","abstract":"This paper explores the design space and implementation of a Class F\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u22121</sup>\nPA using an in-package solution for sub-6 GHz macro base station applications.

On-chip image rejection filters (IRF) and LO leakage cancellation circuits are designed in each channel to improve the array in-band linearity and suppress the LO leakage. Differential on-chip antenna feeds (on top metal) are electromagnetically (EM) coupled to high-efficiency patch antennas on a 100-\u00b5m-thick quartz superstrate. The antennas are placed \u03bb/2 (~140 GHz) apart between adjacent channels in the horizontal and vertical directions with a chip size of 5.4 mm \u00d7 5.1 mm. The 4 \u00d7 2-element array can scan to \u00b130\u00b0 in the elevation plane (E-plane). The phased-array transmitter results in a measured EIRP of 27\u201332 dBm at 134\u2013146 GHz.

As demonstrated using a 15-parameter impedance transformer, the combination of these mechanisms permits identification of the Pareto set at the cost of just a few hundred of EM circuit simulations.

In order to enhance overall gain of the circuit, gm-boosting and single-ended neutralization techniques are applied to the circuit. The VGLNA exhibits a peak gain of 21.4 dB at 37 GHz, 3-dB bandwidth covering from 26 to 30.5 GHz (band1) and 33.8 to 40.6 GHz (band2), respectively. An RMS phase error less than 4.3\u00b0 and the maximum phase variation of 7.2\u00b0 are achieved within the 9.8-dB gain control range (GCR) in the 3-dB bandwidth. The noise figure is 4.7 dB at 36 GHz in the maximum gain state. The chip consumes 17.9 mW dc power from 1-V voltage supply.

The former is required for sensing and perception, more frequently so under various unfavorable environmental conditions such as heavy precipitation; the latter is needed to transmit time-critical data. Forthcoming proliferation of faster 5G networks utilizing mmWave is likely to lead to interference with automotive radar sensors, which has led to a body of research on the development of Joint Radar Communication (JRC) systems and solutions. This paper considers the problem of time-sharing for JRC, with the additional simultaneous objective of minimizing the average age of information (AoI) transmitted by a JRC-equipped AV. We formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) where the JRC agent determines in a real-time manner when radar detection is necessary, and how to manage a multiclass data queue where each class represents different urgency levels of data packets. Simulations are run with a range of environmental parameters to mimic variations in real-world operation. The results show that deep reinforcement learning allows the agent to obtain good results with minimal a priori knowledge about the environment.","doi":"10.1109/IV48863.2021.9575131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IV48863.2021.9575131","startPage":"8","endPage":"15","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles

existing datasets, e.g., by strengthening underrepresented classes or by adding new lighting or weather conditions for more variety. Synthetic images can also be used to introduce entirely new classes to a given dataset. In order to maximize the positive effects of generated image data on classifier training and reduce the possible downsides of potentially problematic image samples, an automatic quality assessment of each generated image seems sensible for overall quality enhancement of the training set and, thus, of the resulting classifier. In this paper we extend our previous work on synthetic traffic sign images by assessing the quality of a fully generated dataset consisting of 215,000 traffic sign images using four different measures. According to each sample's quality, we successively reduce the size of our training set and evaluate the performance with SVM and CNN classifiers to verify the approach. The comparability of real-world and synthetic training data is investigated by contrasting several classifiers trained on generated data to our baseline w.r.t. actual misclassifications during testing.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9575130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IV48863.2021.9575337","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9575127/9575130/09575337.pdf","startPage":"832","endPage":"837","doi":"10.1109/IV48863.2021.9575337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Selection of High-Quality Synthetic Images for Data-Driven Machine Learning: A Study on Traffic Signs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Automated Selection of High-Quality Synthetic Images for Data-Driven Machine Learning: A Study on Traffic Signs","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-17 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9575337/","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","accessionNumber":"21274268","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9575337/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Selection of High-Quality Synthetic Images for Data-Driven Machine Learning: A Study on Traffic Signs","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"0299.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096575S","chronDate":"11-17 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9575127","isNumber":"9575130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9575127","xplore-issue":"9575130","articleId":"9575337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9575458,"authors":[{"name":"Ihor Lazarovych","affiliation":["Vasyl Stefanyk Precarpathian National University, Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Ihor","lastName":"Lazarovych","orcid":"0000-0001-5219-4714","id":"37086364103"},{"name":"Mykola Kozlenko","affiliation":["Vasyl Stefanyk Precarpathian National University, Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Mykola","lastName":"Kozlenko","orcid":"0000-0002-2502-2447","id":"37085789485"},{"name":"Mykola Kuz","affiliation":["Vasyl Stefanyk Precarpathian National University, Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Mykola","lastName":"Kuz","orcid":"0000-0002-9875-1579","id":"37085792386"},{"name":"Valerii Tkachuk","affiliation":["Vasyl Stefanyk Precarpathian National University, Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Valerii","lastName":"Tkachuk","orcid":"0000-0001-7366-1676","id":"37088461387"},{"name":"Mariia Dutchak","affiliation":["Vasyl Stefanyk Precarpathian National University, Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Mariia","lastName":"Dutchak","orcid":"0000-0002-3337-5613","id":"37089010003"},{"name":"Ivan Savka","affiliation":["Vasyl Stefanyk Precarpathian National University, Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Savka","orcid":"0000-0002-3442-5547","id":"37089009858"},{"name":"Mykola Pikuliak","affiliation":["Vasyl Stefanyk Precarpathian National University, Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Mykola","lastName":"Pikuliak","orcid":"0000-0003-2192-1899","id":"37088513300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0094-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0095-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9575458","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Simulation","Software algorithms","Interference","Software","Timing","Binary phase shift keying","Telecommunications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["randomization","noise immunity","correlation","phase-shift keying","neural network","perceptron","SNR","BER","medical sensor","satellite communication"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9575458","doi":"10.1109/UKRCON53503.2021.9575458","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 3rd Ukraine Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (UKRCON)","abstract":"This paper presents a new method for noise-immune demodulation of BPSK signals.

CNNs have become one of the standard approaches for traffic sign detection research in recent years. The use of CNNs has allowed the development of traffic sign detectors that are capable of achieving prediction accuracies similar to those of human drivers. However, most CNNs do not run in real-time due to the high number of computational operations involved during the inference phase. This hinders the deployment of CNNs in autonomous vehicles despite their high prediction accuracy. In this paper, we explore BNNs to tackle this problem. BNNs binarize the full-precision weights and activations of a CNN, drastically reducing the complexity of the computational operations required for inference, while at the same time maintaining the architectural parameters, as well as spatial dimensions of the input image. This reduces the memory required to run the model and enables faster inference time. We carry out in-depth studies on applying BNNs for traffic sign detection using real-world datasets. We observe an improvement of 11.63 \u00d7 for normalized compute complexity, while suffering only 3.93 pp in detection accuracy on GTSDB dataset.","doi":"10.1109/IV48863.2021.9575557","startPage":"1400","endPage":"1405","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IV48863.2021.9575557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9575130","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9575127/9575130/09575557.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigating Binary Neural Networks for Traffic Sign Detection and Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9575557/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Investigating Binary Neural Networks for Traffic Sign Detection and Recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9575557/","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"11-17 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 July 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigating Binary Neural Networks for Traffic Sign Detection and Recognition","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"0284.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101896S","chronDate":"11-17 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9575127","isNumber":"9575130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9575127","xplore-issue":"9575130","articleId":"9575557","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":9575599,"authors":[{"name":"Oliver De Candido","affiliation":["Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"De Candido","id":"37085663627"},{"name":"Maximilian Binder","affiliation":["Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Maximilian","lastName":"Binder","id":"37089016927"},{"name":"Wolfgang Utschick","affiliation":["Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Utschick","id":"37273316200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-5394-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-5393-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-5395-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9575599","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":16},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9575599","abstract":"In this paper, we address the challenge of employing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in safety critical driving functions.

To this end, we introduce an interpretable Lane Change Detector (LCD) algorithm which takes advantage of the performance of modern ML-based anomaly detection methods. We independently train three Deep Autoencoders (DAEs) on different driving maneuvers: lane keeping, right lane changes, and left lane changes. The lane changes are subsequently detected by observing the reconstruction errors at the output of each DAE. Since the detection is purely based on the reconstruction errors of independently trained DAEs, we show that the classification outputs are completely interpretable. We compare the introduced algorithm with black-box Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based classifiers, and train all methods on realistic highway driving data. We discuss both the costs and the benefits of an interpretable classification, and demonstrate the inherent interpretability of the algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/IV48863.2021.9575599","startPage":"516","endPage":"523","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9575127/9575130/09575599.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IV48863.2021.9575599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9575130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Interpretable Lane Change Detector Algorithm based on Deep Autoencoder Anomaly Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Road transportation","Machine learning algorithms","Recurrent neural networks","Detectors","Machine learning","Liquid crystal displays","Classification algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9575599/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"An Interpretable Lane Change Detector Algorithm based on Deep Autoencoder Anomaly Detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9575599/","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"11-17 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Interpretable Lane Change Detector Algorithm based on Deep Autoencoder Anomaly Detection","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"0346.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067589S","chronDate":"11-17 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9575127","isNumber":"9575130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9575127","xplore-issue":"9575130","articleId":"9575599","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":9575620,"authors":[{"name":"Moritz Benedikt Fischer","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Moritz Benedikt","lastName":"Fischer","id":"37089013116"},{"name":"Sebastian D\u00f6rner","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"D\u00f6rner","id":"37086305081"},{"name":"Sebastian Cammerer","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Cammerer","id":"37085796220"},{"name":"Takayuki Shimizu","affiliation":["InfoTech Lab, Toyota Motor North America"],"firstName":"Takayuki","lastName":"Shimizu","id":"37088561855"},{"name":"Bin Cheng","affiliation":["InfoTech Lab, Toyota Motor North America"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37089011765"},{"name":"Hongsheng Lu","affiliation":["InfoTech Lab, Toyota Motor North America"],"firstName":"Hongsheng","lastName":"Lu","id":"37089011805"},{"name":"Stephan ten Brink","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Stephan ten","lastName":"Brink","id":"37698960900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-5394-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-5393-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-5395-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9575620","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9575620","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wiener filters","Recurrent neural networks","Equalizers","OFDM","Channel estimation","Estimation","Artificial neural networks"]}],"abstract":"We compare the potential of neural network (NN)-based channel estimation with classical linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE)-based estimators, also known as Wiener filtering. For this, we propose a low-complexity recurrent neural network (RNN)-based estimator that allows channel equalization of a sequence of channel observations based on independent time- and frequency-domain long short-term memory (LSTM) cells. Motivated by Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) applications, we simulate time- and frequency-selective channels with orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) and extend our channel models in such a way that a continuous degradation from line-of-sight (LoS) to non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions can be emulated. It turns out that the NN-based system cannot just compete with the LMMSE equalizer, but it also can be trained w.r.t. resilience against system parameter mismatch. We thereby showcase the conceptual simplicity of such a data-driven system design, as this not only enables more robustness against, e.g., signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) or Doppler spread estimation mismatches, but also allows to use the same equalizer over a wider range of input parameters without the need of re-building (or re-estimating) the filter coefficients. Particular attention has been paid to ensure compatibility with the existing IEEE 802.11p piloting scheme for V2X communications. Finally, feeding the payload data symbols as additional equalizer input unleashes further performance gains. We show significant gains over the conventional LMMSE equalization for highly dynamic channel conditions if such a data-augmented equalization scheme is used.","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9575127/9575130/09575620.pdf","startPage":"458","endPage":"465","doi":"10.1109/IV48863.2021.9575620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IV48863.2021.9575620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9575130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wiener Filter versus Recurrent Neural Network-based 2D-Channel Estimation for V2X Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9575620/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Wiener Filter versus Recurrent Neural Network-based 2D-Channel Estimation for V2X Communications","htmlLink":"/document/9575620/","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-17 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002347","fundingName":"Federal Ministry of Education and Research of the Federal Republic of Germany","grantNumber":"16KIS1187"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wiener Filter versus Recurrent Neural Network-based 2D-Channel Estimation for V2X Communications","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"0094.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085405S","chronDate":"11-17 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9575127","isNumber":"9575130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9575127","xplore-issue":"9575130","articleId":"9575620","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":9575961,"authors":[{"name":"Anastasiia Sheremet","affiliation":["Petro Mohyla Black Sea National University, Mykolaiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Anastasiia","lastName":"Sheremet","id":"37089010879"},{"name":"Yuriy Kondratenko","affiliation":["Petro Mohyla Black Sea National University, Mykolaiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Yuriy","lastName":"Kondratenko","id":"38015853700"},{"name":"Ievgen Sidenko","affiliation":["Petro Mohyla Black Sea National University, Mykolaiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Ievgen","lastName":"Sidenko","id":"37086018633"},{"name":"Galyna Kondratenko","affiliation":["Petro Mohyla Black Sea National University, Mykolaiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Galyna","lastName":"Kondratenko","id":"37086261338"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0094-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0095-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9575961","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":8},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9575961","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Image recognition","Pulmonary diseases","Decision making","Computer architecture","Data models","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["machine learning","computer vision","artificial neural network","object recognition","medical image"]}],"doi":"10.1109/UKRCON53503.2021.9575961","pdfPath":"/iel7/9575129/9575137/09575961.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 3rd Ukraine Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (UKRCON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 3rd Ukraine Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (UKRCON)","startPage":"561","endPage":"565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9575137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UKRCON53503.2021.9575961","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diagnosis of Lung Disease Based on Medical Images Using Artificial Neural Networks","abstract":"The rapid development of technological advances, due to which computer algorithms for image analysis compete with professionals in terms of accuracy, but remain unchanged in speed and volume of cases.

Instead of automatically learning the embedding vector for temporal representation of the input data with Recurrent Neural Networks, we propose a combination of Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) for data representation in high-dimensional vectors and much simpler feed-forward neural networks. This approach provides three key advantages: first, instead of having a \u201cblack box\u201d of Recurrent Neural Networks learning the temporal representation of the data, our approach allows to encode this temporal structure in high-dimensional vectors in a human-comprehensible way using the algebraic operations of HDC while only relying on feed-forward neural networks for the classification task. Second, we show that this combination is able to achieve at least similar and even slightly superior classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based networks while significantly reducing training time and the necessary amount of data for successful learning. Third, our HDC-based data representation as well as the feed-forward neural network, allow implementation in the substrate of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). SNNs show promise to be orders of magnitude more energy-efficient than their rate-based counterparts while maintaining comparable prediction accuracy when being deployed on dedicated neuromorphic computing hardware, which could be an energy-efficient addition in future intelligent vehicles with tight restrictions regarding on-board computing and energy resources. We present a thorough analysis of our approach on a publicly available data set including a comparison with state-of-the-art reference models.","doi":"10.1109/IV48863.2021.9576028","startPage":"602","endPage":"609","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IV48863.2021.9576028","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9575130","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9575127/9575130/09576028.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multivariate Time Series Analysis for Driving Style Classification using Neural Networks and Hyperdimensional Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9576028/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multivariate Time Series Analysis for Driving Style Classification using Neural Networks and Hyperdimensional Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9576028/","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"11-17 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 July 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multivariate Time Series Analysis for Driving Style Classification using Neural Networks and Hyperdimensional Computing","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"0349.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091994S","chronDate":"11-17 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9575127","isNumber":"9575130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9575127","xplore-issue":"9575130","articleId":"9576028","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":9576040,"authors":[{"name":"Dhruvkumar Patel","affiliation":["University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas"],"firstName":"Dhruvkumar","lastName":"Patel","id":"37088661296"},{"name":"Rym Zalila-Wenkstern","affiliation":["University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas"],"firstName":"Rym","lastName":"Zalila-Wenkstern","id":"38299995400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-5394-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-5393-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-5395-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9576040","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9576040","abstract":"Connected and autonomous vehiles (CAVs) require an effective cooperative action planning strategy in an emergency situation. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a promising planning technique for such problems with large state spaces. However, traditional MCTS-based techniques do not scale well with the number of vehicles. In this paper, we present a novel MCTS-based cooperative action planning algorithm for CAV s driving in a coalition formation. Our proposed algorithm improves the reliability and the scalability of M CTS. Explicit communication is used to ensure that mitigation action plans chosen by the CAVs are conflict-free when possible. We perform the evaluation of the proposed algorithm in a large scale multi-agent based traffic simulation system. Our simulated experiments show that our approach improves upon current state-of-the-art centralized and decentralized algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/IV48863.2021.9576040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9575130","startPage":"1065","endPage":"1072","pdfPath":"/iel7/9575127/9575130/09576040.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IV48863.2021.9576040","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable Monte Carlo Tree Search for CAV s Action Planning in Colliding Scenarios","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","Intelligent vehicles","Scalability","Decision making","Traffic control","Search problems","Planning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Scalable Monte Carlo Tree Search for CAV s Action Planning in Colliding Scenarios","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9576040/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9576040/","publicationDate":"11 July 2021","conferenceDate":"11-17 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable Monte Carlo Tree Search for CAV s Action Planning in Colliding Scenarios","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"0450.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061378S","chronDate":"11-17 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9575127","isNumber":"9575130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9575127","xplore-issue":"9575130","articleId":"9576040","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":9576055,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Yan","affiliation":["Samsung Research Center-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Yan","orcid":"0000-0002-2675-4965"},{"name":"Hao Wang","affiliation":["Samsung Research Center-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Jun Shen","affiliation":["Samsung Research Center-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Shen"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9576055","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Post-Weighting Digital Predistortion Structures for Hybrid Beamforming Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear distortion","Array signal processing","Predistortion","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Training","Massive MIMO","Tuning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital predistortion","hybrid beamforming","massive MIMO"]}],"abstract":"We propose a new method to tackle the predistortion problem for the hybrid beamforming structure of Millimeter-Wave (MM-Wave) Massive MIMO in 5G communication systems in order to widen the linearized angle of beams without any requirement or retuning on the nonlinearities of power amplifiers (PA).

The surrogate model is learned from model forecast values and assimilation results, and its performance is verified using the training accuracy/loss and the validation accuracy/loss at different training times. Second, the assimilation process includes a \u201ctwo-stage\u201d procedure. Stage 0 generates the training sets and trains the surrogate model. Then, the hybrid model is used for the next assimilation period in Stage 1. Finally, several numerical experiments are conducted using the Lorenz-63 and Lorenz-96 models to demonstrate that the proposed approach is better than the ensemble Kalman filter in different model error covariances, observation error covariances, and observation time steps. The proposed approach has also been applied to sparse observations to improve assimilation performance. This hybrid model is restricted to the form of the ensemble Kalman filter. However, the basic strategy is not restricted to any particular version of the Kalman filter.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3120482","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09576076.pdf","startPage":"144952","endPage":"144964","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3120482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining a Fully Connected Neural Network With an Ensemble Kalman Filter to Emulate a Dynamic Model in Data Assimilation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9576076/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Combining a Fully Connected Neural Network With an Ensemble Kalman Filter to Emulate a Dynamic Model in Data Assimilation","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9576076/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"41861047, 41461078 and 62066041"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010726","fundingName":"Foundation of Northwest Normal University of China","grantNumber":"NWNU-LKQN2020-21 and NWNU-LKQN2019-18"},{"fundingName":"Scientific Research Program of the Higher Education Institutions of Gansu Province","grantNumber":"2020A-016"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Combining a Fully Connected Neural Network With an Ensemble Kalman Filter to Emulate a Dynamic Model in Data Assimilation","sourcePdf":"access-fan-3120482-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118341S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9576076","onlineDate":"15 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9576077,"authors":[{"name":"Ibrahim Al-Nahhal","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, Memorial University, St. John\u2019s, NL, Canada"],"firstName":"Ibrahim","lastName":"Al-Nahhal","orcid":"0000-0002-8604-392X"},{"name":"Octavia A.

In this letter, for the first time, the RIS phase shifts of the uplink RIS-SCMA system are optimized based on the alternate optimization (AO) technique to improve the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a discrete set of RIS phase shifts. The system model of the uplink RIS-SCMA is formulated to utilize the AO algorithm. For further reduction in the computational complexity, a low-complexity AO (LC-AO) algorithm is proposed. The complexity analysis of the two proposed algorithms is performed. Monte Carlo simulations and complexity analysis show that the proposed algorithms significantly improve the received SNR compared to the non-optimized RIS-SCMA scenario. The LC-AO provides the same received SNR as the AO algorithm, with a significant reduction in complexity. Moreover, the deployment of RISs for the uplink RIS-SCMA is investigated.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9674048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3120560","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9674048/09576077.pdf","startPage":"133","endPage":"137","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3120560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Optimization for Uplink Sparse Code Multiple Access","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Optimization for Uplink Sparse Code Multiple Access","volume":"26","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9576077/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9576077/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), through its Discovery program"},{"fundingName":"TUBITAK","grantNumber":"120E401"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Optimization for Uplink Sparse Code Multiple Access","sourcePdf":"lcomm-dobre-3120560-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096109S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9674048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9674048","articleId":"9576077","onlineDate":"15 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9576081,"authors":[{"name":"Thien Huynh-The","affiliation":["Kumoh National Institute of Technology, Gumi, Republic of Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9576081/huynh-3120419-small.gif","p":["Thien Huynh-The (Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in electronics and telecommunication engineering from the Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology and Education, Vietnam, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science and engineering from Kyung Hee University (KHU), South Korea, in 2018.","From March 2018 to August 2018, he was at KHU.

DL is capable of learning the underlying characteristics of radio signals effectively for modulation pattern recognition, which in turn improves the modulation classification performance under the presence of channel impairments. In this work, we first provide the fundamental concepts of various architectures, such as neural networks, recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory, and convolutional neural networks as the necessary background. We then convey a comprehensive study of DL for AMC in wireless communications, where technical analysis is deliberated in the perspective of state-of-the-art deep architectures. Remarkably, several sophisticated structures and advanced designs of convolutional neural networks are investigated for different data types of sequential radio signals, spectrum images, and constellation images to deal with various channel impairments.

This paper overviews previous contributions on sparsity exploitation from both the software and hardware side of views, with the newly proposed taxonomy to categorize and analyze the works. On the software side, different sparsification algorithms are explained, including pruning and output speculation. From the hardware\u2019s perspective, advancements in architectures to efficiently handle sparse DNN computation are elaborated. The proposed taxonomy will help classify previous accelerators easily, by which sparsity they exploit and how. In addition, related works on sparse processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures and similarity exploitation are briefly introduced.","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2021.3120417","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503868/9647029/09576091.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","startPage":"634","endPage":"648","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2021.3120417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9647029","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9576091/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","displayDocTitle":"An Overview of Sparsity Exploitation in CNNs for On-Device Intelligence With Software-Hardware Cross-Layer Optimizations","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9576091/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100014188","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), Government of Korea (Development of DRAM-Processing-In-Memory Chip for DNN Computing)","grantNumber":"2021-0-00871"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Overview of Sparsity Exploitation in CNNs for On-Device Intelligence With Software-Hardware Cross-Layer Optimizations","sourcePdf":"jetcas-kang-3120417-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107138S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"9647029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","xplore-issue":"9647029","articleId":"9576091","onlineDate":"15 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9576093,"authors":[{"name":"Juhwan Kim","affiliation":["Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9576093/kim-3120384-small.gif","p":["Juhwan Kim received the B.S. degree in computer science and engineering from Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU), South Korea, in 2021, where he is currently pursuing the M.S. degree in computer science and engineering.

However, MCTS requires significant computing loads to evaluate many nodes in the decision tree to make a good decision. Parallelizing MCTS node evaluations is challenging because MCTS is a sequential process that each round of tree traversal depends on the previous node evaluations. In this work, we present \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SpecMCTS</i>\n, a new approach for accelerating MCTS by speculatively traversing the search tree. Many MCTS applications, such as AlphaGo Zero, use a deep neural network (DNN) model to evaluate the tree nodes during the search. SpecMCTS uses a pair of DNN models, the \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">speculation model</i>\n and the \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">main model</i>\n. The faster (but less accurate) speculation model accelerates the sequential tree search while the more accurate main model improves the decision quality. SpecMCTS accelerates MCTS for the game of Go by up to \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$2.09\\times {}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n on the NVIDIA T4 GPU. This performance improvement can be translated into a better decision quality by performing a larger number of tree traversals within the time limit. For a fixed decision time, SpecMCTS shows stronger gameplay (higher win rate) than the original sequential MCTS and state-of-the-art MCTS parallelization approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3120384","startPage":"142195","endPage":"142205","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3120384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09576093.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SpecMCTS: Accelerating Monte Carlo Tree Search Using Speculative Tree Traversal","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9576093/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"SpecMCTS: Accelerating Monte Carlo Tree Search Using Speculative Tree Traversal","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9576093/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) funded by the Korea Government [Ministry of Science, ICT (MSIT)] Research on CPU Vulnerability Detection and Validation","grantNumber":"2019-0-00533"},{"fundingName":"High-Potential Individuals Global Training Program","grantNumber":"2020-0-01550"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010418","fundingName":"Development of high Speed Encryption Data Processing Technology that Guarantees Privacy Based Hardware","grantNumber":"2021-0-00779"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"SpecMCTS: Accelerating Monte Carlo Tree Search Using Speculative Tree Traversal","sourcePdf":"access-cho-3120384-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060619S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9576093","onlineDate":"15 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9576100,"authors":[{"name":"Sachitha C.

However, the comparative performance analyses of different ML classifiers within the confines of road anomaly detection remain unexplored under some specific capture conditions such as bright light, dim light, and hazy image conditions. Consequently, this paper investigates the performance of six different state-of-the-art ML classification algorithms, viz: random forest, JRip, One-R,naive Bayesian, J48, and AdaBoost for segmenting pothole road anomalies under three different environmental conditions viz: bright, dim, and hazy light conditions. The results obtained suggest that either the J48 random forest or JRip classifiers are suitable for classifying pothole anomalies captured under broad day light (bright light) conditions with an average accuracy performance of 95%. On the other hand, the One-R classifier sufficed as more suitable for use under hazy image condition yielding an average accuracy of 73%, whereas the random forest algorithm yielded the best classification accuracy of 55%under dim light conditions. These results are helpful particularly towards determining the best ML classifiers for use towards developing robust artificial intelligence-based real-time algorithms for detecting and characterizing road anomalies effectively in autonomous vehicles.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 30th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9575168/9576159/09576214.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 30th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)","doi":"10.1109/ISIE45552.2021.9576214","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE45552.2021.9576214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9576159","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9576214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Machine Learning Classifiers for Pothole Road Anomaly Segmentation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Machine learning algorithms","Roads","Unmanned vehicles","Real-time systems","Classification algorithms","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly","Detection","Classifier","Image","Machine Learning","Potholes","Road","Segmentation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9576214/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2021","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Machine Learning Classifiers for Pothole Road Anomaly Segmentation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9576214/","publicationDate":"20 June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2021","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Machine Learning Classifiers for Pothole Road Anomaly Segmentation","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"KF-003867.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088778S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9575168","isNumber":"9576159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9575168","xplore-issue":"9576159","articleId":"9576214","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9576228,"authors":[{"name":"Georgeta Bauer","affiliation":["Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada"],"firstName":"Georgeta","lastName":"Bauer","id":"37086929278"},{"name":"Ya-Jun Pan","affiliation":["Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada"],"firstName":"Ya-Jun","lastName":"Pan","id":"37401472400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9023-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9022-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9024-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2163-5137"}],"articleNumber":"9576228","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":9},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptation models","Torque","Telepresence","Uncertainty","Regulators","Delay effects","Exoskeletons"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Radial basis function neural networks","Exoskeletons","Teleoperators","Telerobotics","Patient rehabilitation","Telepresence","Human-robot interaction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9576228","abstract":"With an unprecedented increase in the global aging population and with it, the age-related neuromuscular dysfunction diseases, there is an exorbitant and escalating need for physical rehabilitation. Delivering these services - especially to those that are most vulnerable - under the current COVID-19 pandemic restriction for physical-distancing, is an even greater challenge. Interest in telerehabilitation is spiking, and robotic tel-erehabilitation could drastically improve patients' access to care. Some of the major challenges in developing the control methods for these robots are identifying, estimating, and overcoming the effects of dynamic modeling uncertainties, nonlinearities, and disturbances. Having humans in the loop creates the additional need for safety and compliance. Telerehabilitation control methods have the added requirement of delivering telepresence and addressing communication delays which, if not managed, could result in ineffective therapy, destabilize the system, and even cause injury. In this paper, we present a novel adaptive robust integral Radial Basis Function Neural Network Impedance model (RBFNN-I) control method for telerehabilitation with robotic exoskeletons which compensates for dynamic modeling uncertainties in the presence of external human torques and time delays. One of the salient features of the proposed control system is the implementation of a new human torque regulator which improves telepresence. Stability proof using Lyapunov stability theory is shown for the proposed control method. An exoskeleton was designed and used for unilateral and bilateral telerehabilitation simulations. Excellent tracking performance, telepresence and stability was achieved in the presence of large, variable and asymmetric time delays and human torques.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE45552.2021.9576228","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 30th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE45552.2021.9576228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9576159","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 30th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9575168/9576159/09576228.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Telerehabilitation with Exoskeletons using Adaptive Robust Integral RBF-Neural-Network Impedance Control under Variable Time Delays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9576228/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Telerehabilitation with Exoskeletons using Adaptive Robust Integral RBF-Neural-Network Impedance Control under Variable Time Delays","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9576228/","publicationDate":"20 June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Telerehabilitation with Exoskeletons using Adaptive Robust Integral RBF-Neural-Network Impedance Control under Variable Time Delays","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"KF-004669.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076408S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9575168","isNumber":"9576159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9575168","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9576159","articleId":"9576228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":9576231,"authors":[{"name":"Pankaj Mishra","affiliation":["University of Udine, Italy"],"firstName":"Pankaj","lastName":"Mishra","id":"37089011887"},{"name":"Riccardo Verk","affiliation":["University of Udine, Italy"],"firstName":"Riccardo","lastName":"Verk","id":"37089011900"},{"name":"Daniele Fornasier","affiliation":["BeanTech srl, Italy"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Fornasier","id":"37089016500"},{"name":"Claudio Piciarelli","affiliation":["University of Udine, Italy"],"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Piciarelli","id":"37295099500"},{"name":"Gian Luca Foresti","affiliation":["University of Udine, Italy"],"firstName":"Gian Luca","lastName":"Foresti","id":"37277334700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9023-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9022-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9024-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2163-5137"}],"articleNumber":"9576231","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Location awareness","Industrial electronics","Image segmentation","Transformers","Task analysis","Anomaly detection","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly Detection","Anomaly segmentation","Vision transformer","Gaussian density approximation","Anomaly dataset"]}],"abstract":"We present a transformer-based image anomaly detection and localization network.

Fault diagnosis with artificial intelligence is an effective method to classify the machinery failure rapidly and automatically. However, the training process requires mass of labeled data which is impractical to obtain. Transfer learning are promoted to overcome the shortage of data by transferring the results of related study and combining current resources to diagnosis. Domain adversarial training of neural networks (DANN) as a typical model of transfer learning efficiently solves this problem. In addition, cohesion evaluation technique is used in the data preprocessing to establish low-dimensional sensitivity feature vectors. In order to verify the effectiveness of the methods, experiments are conducted on two different platforms for transfer learning. The experiment reveals that the proposed method can achieve better results than conventional methods under several evaluation metrics.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE45552.2021.9576238","startPage":"01","endPage":"06","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 30th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9575168/9576159/09576238.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 30th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE45552.2021.9576238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9576159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Diagnosis of Rotating Machinery based on Domain Adversarial Training of Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Fault diagnosis","Industries","Industrial electronics","Sensitivity","Transfer learning","Neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Rotating Machinery","Fault Diagnosis","Transfer Learning","Neural Network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9576238/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2021","displayDocTitle":"Fault Diagnosis of Rotating Machinery based on Domain Adversarial Training of Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9576238/","publicationDate":"20 June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61603223"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Diagnosis of Rotating Machinery based on Domain Adversarial Training of Neural Networks","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"KF-001872.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077832S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9575168","isNumber":"9576159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9575168","xplore-issue":"9576159","articleId":"9576238","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":9576252,"authors":[{"name":"Farzaneh Bagheri","affiliation":["Antalya Bilim University, Antalya, Turkey"],"firstName":"Farzaneh","lastName":"Bagheri","id":"37086383051"},{"name":"Sertac Bayhan","affiliation":["Qatar Environment and Energy Research Institute, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Sertac","lastName":"Bayhan","id":"37606114600"},{"name":"Hasan Komurcugil","affiliation":["Eastern Mediterranean University, Turkey"],"firstName":"Hasan","lastName":"Komurcugil","id":"37299907600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9023-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9022-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9024-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2163-5137"}],"articleNumber":"9576252","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Total harmonic distortion","Simulation","Zero voltage switching","Inverters","Robustness","Steady-state","Time factors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active clamped flyback-forward converter","super twisting sliding mode control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9576252","doi":"10.1109/ISIE45552.2021.9576252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE45552.2021.9576252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9576159","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 30th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 30th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9575168/9576159/09576252.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sliding Mode Control of an Isolated Inverter Based on Active Clamped Flyback-Forward Converter","abstract":"This paper presents a super twisting sliding mode control method for a high-efficiency high-boost interleaved soft-switching flyback-forward converter supplying a standalone inverter. In the proposed control method, the dc side input current and the ac side load voltage are injected to the sliding mode control as the state variables and the chattering is eliminated by applying the super twisting sliding mode control input. Two main switches and two active clamp switches are leveraged in the dc side which is operated by the signals obtained from the dc side sliding function. The full bridge inverter is controlled by the pulses obtained from the ac side sliding control input. To generate the dc side input current reference, a PI regulator is employed to process the dc side output voltage and determine the input current reference.

Thermal anomaly detection can identify problematic battery packs that may eventually undergo thermal runaway. However, there are common challenges like data unavailability, environment and configuration variations, and battery aging. We propose a data-driven method to detect battery thermal anomaly based on comparing shape-similarity between thermal measurements. Based on their shapes, the measurements are continuously being grouped into different clusters. Anomaly is detected by monitoring deviations within the clusters. Unlike model-based or other data-driven methods, the proposed method is robust to data loss and requires minimal reference data for different pack configurations. As the initial experimental results show, the method not only can be more accurate than the onboard BMS and but also can detect unforeseen anomalies at the early stage.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE45552.2021.9576348","pdfPath":"/iel7/9575168/9576159/09576348.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 30th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 30th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE45552.2021.9576348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9576159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-driven Thermal Anomaly Detection for Batteries using Unsupervised Shape Clustering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9576348/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2021","displayDocTitle":"Data-driven Thermal Anomaly Detection for Batteries using Unsupervised Shape Clustering","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","publicationDate":"20 June 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9576348/","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-driven Thermal Anomaly Detection for Batteries using Unsupervised Shape Clustering","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"KF-004901.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.131373S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9575168","isNumber":"9576159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9575168","xplore-issue":"9576159","articleId":"9576348","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9576411,"authors":[{"name":"Masaaki Fujii","affiliation":["MinebeaMitsumi Inc.

As a dedicated energy beamforming (DEB) technique designed to be compatibly embedded into the RB-based system, we propose a semi-random DEB scheme based on opportunistic search for a sub-optimum beamformer by feeding back a time slot index in which the received signal strength indicator is maximized. To handle a large number of devices, we also propose a simple space-time scheduler to easily and efficiently schedule those devices to time-domain subframes by spatially multiplexing DEB using different antenna subsets in the same subframe. Our simulation results demonstrated that DEB achieved higher energy transfer efficiency than RB and that the space-time scheduler efficiently multiplexed multiple sets of DEB to increase periodical energy transfer efficiency.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE45552.2021.9576411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9576159","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 30th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9575168/9576159/09576411.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-Time Scheduled Energy Beamforming in Distributed Random-Beamforming Wireless Energy Transfer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9576411/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9576411/","displayDocTitle":"Space-Time Scheduled Energy Beamforming in Distributed Random-Beamforming Wireless Energy Transfer","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2021","publicationDate":"20 June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002241","fundingName":"JST","grantNumber":"JPMJCE1307"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-Time Scheduled Energy Beamforming in Distributed Random-Beamforming Wireless Energy Transfer","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"KF-001198.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04867S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9575168","isNumber":"9576159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9575168","xplore-issue":"9576159","articleId":"9576411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":9576442,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Bragantini","affiliation":["Aachen Institute for Advanced Study in Computational Engineering Science, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Bragantini","id":"37089012528"},{"name":"Davide Baroli","affiliation":["Aachen Institute for Advanced Study in Computational Engineering Science, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Davide","lastName":"Baroli","id":"37089014021"},{"name":"Andres Felipe Posada-Moreno","affiliation":["Institut for Data Science in Mechanical Engineering, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Andres Felipe","lastName":"Posada-Moreno","id":"37088893227"},{"name":"Andrea Benigni","affiliation":["Chair of Methods for Simulation of Energy Systems, RWTH Aachen University","Institute of Energy and Climate Research, Forschungszentrum Juelich GmbH, Juelich, Germany"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Benigni","id":"37392708200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9023-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9022-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9024-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2163-5137"}],"articleNumber":"9576442","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":24},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Industrial electronics","Low voltage","Simulation","Artificial neural networks","Predictive models","Tools","Robustness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["power systems","neural networks","state estimation","monitoring"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9576442","abstract":"This work wants to contribute to the current research effort of exploiting deep learning models to tackle the problem of state estimation in power systems.

In the first instance, a detailed more electric aircraft (MEA) electrical power system (EPS) circuit model is simulated in a loop using different combinations of the converters droop coefficients within a design space. The inaccurate output DC currents sharing of the converters due to the influence of the unequal cable resistance are then obtained from each of the simulations. The data generated is then used to train the NN to be a dedicated surrogate model of the detailed MEA EPS simulation. Thus, for any user-defined desired current sharing among the converters that are within the design space, the proposed NN can provide the optimal droop coefficients. This NN approach has been verified through simulations to ensure accurate current sharing between the converters as desired. Hence, can be used in the design of the droop coefficient to enhance the performance of the conventional droop control method.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE45552.2021.9576482","pdfPath":"/iel7/9575168/9576159/09576482.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 30th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 30th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE45552.2021.9576482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9576159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Droop Coefficient Design in Droop Control of Power Converters for Improved Load Sharing: An Artificial Neural Network Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9576482/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2021","displayDocTitle":"Droop Coefficient Design in Droop Control of Power Converters for Improved Load Sharing: An Artificial Neural Network Approach","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","publicationDate":"20 June 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9576482/","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme","grantNumber":"807081"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100009614","fundingName":"Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Droop Coefficient Design in Droop Control of Power Converters for Improved Load Sharing: An Artificial Neural Network Approach","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"KF-004561.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054001S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9575168","isNumber":"9576159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9575168","xplore-issue":"9576159","articleId":"9576482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9576499,"authors":[{"name":"Alain Couvreur","affiliation":["Inria and the LIX, \u00c9cole polytechnique, Palaiseau, France"],"bio":{"p":["Alain Couvreur received the Ph.D. degree in pure mathematics from the University of Toulouse, France, in 2008.

This paper relates Blowfish privacy to an important measure of privacy loss of information channels from the communications theory community: min-entropy leakage. Symmetry in an input data neighbouring relation is central to known connections between differential privacy and min-entropy leakage.

To bound the min-entropy leakage of Blowfish-private mechanisms we organise our analysis over symmetrical partitions corresponding to orbits of graph automorphism groups.

The proposed system integrates two functions; the first uses physiological sensors to recognize the emotions of users listening to music, and the second classifies music according to the feelings evoked in the listeners, without using physiological sensors. Moreover, to directly predict the user\u2019s emotions from sensor data acquired through wearable physiological sensors, we developed and implemented a hierarchical inner attention-mechanism-based deep neural network. To relieve the discomfort of users wearing physiological sensors every time to receive content recommendations, the relation between emotion-specific features that are extracted from previously generated physiological signals, and musical features that are extracted from music is learned through a regression neural network. Based on these models, the proposed system classifies input music automatically according to users\u2019 emotional reactions without measuring human physiological signals. The experimental results not only demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed automatic music classification framework, but also provide a new perspective in which human experience-based characteristics related to emotion are applied to artificial-intelligence-based content classification.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Multiple signal classification","Physiology","Music","Sensors","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Neural networks","Deep learning","Physiology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep neural network","emotion-based music classification","musical features","physiological signals","regression neural network"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9660829","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2021.3120445","startPage":"341","endPage":"349","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/30/9660829/09576512.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2021.3120445","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-Function Integrated Emotion-Based Music Classification System Using Features From Physiological Signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Dual-Function Integrated Emotion-Based Music Classification System Using Features From Physiological Signals","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","volume":"67","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9576512/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9576512/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002643","fundingName":"Research Grant of Kwangwoon University in 2021"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010002","fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"NRF-2018R1D1A1B07041783"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-Function Integrated Emotion-Based Music Classification System Using Features From Physiological Signals","sourcePdf":"tce-kim-3120445-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084248S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"9660829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","xplore-issue":"9660829","articleId":"9576512","onlineDate":"15 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":9576532,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Wang","affiliation":["Soochow University, Suzhou, China"],"bio":{"p":["Xin Wang received the Ph.D. degree in mathematics from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China, in 2017.

Existing hand-crafted priors-based methods suffer from limited representation abilities, and supervised deep learning methods need high-quality training data. This paper proposes a novel video rain streaks removal method by reconciling hand-crafted and self-supervised deep priors. The hand-crafted priors include the learned gradient prior, the sparse prior, and the temporal local smooth prior. Meanwhile, a deep convolutional neural network is employed to self-supervisedly capture the deep prior of the clean video without any training data. Our method organically integrates hand-crated priors and self-supervised deep priors to achieve both high generalization abilities and representation abilities. Thus, our method can faithfully remove directional rain streaks in real world videos. To address the resulting model, we introduce an alternating direction multiplier method algorithm. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3120598","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9325893/09576626.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3120598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9325893","startPage":"2147","endPage":"2151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconciling Hand-Crafted and Self-Supervised Deep Priors for Video Directional Rain Streaks Removal","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9576626","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reconciling Hand-Crafted and Self-Supervised Deep Priors for Video Directional Rain Streaks Removal","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9576626/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2021","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9576626/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61876203, 12171072 and 12001446"},{"fundingName":"Applied Basic Research Project of Sichuan Province","grantNumber":"2021YJ0107"},{"fundingName":"Key Project of Applied Basic Research in Sichuan Province","grantNumber":"2020YJ0216"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013290","fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2020YFA0714001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"JBK2102001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconciling Hand-Crafted and Self-Supervised Deep Priors for Video Directional Rain Streaks Removal","sourcePdf":"lsp-zhao-3120598-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056968S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9325893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9325893","articleId":"9576626","onlineDate":"15 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-06"},{"_id":9576629,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Gong","affiliation":["Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570655/9289074/9576629/gong-3120633-small.gif","p":["Yuan Gong (Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in biomedical engineering from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Notre Dame, IN, USA, in 2015 and 2020, respectively.

Since the release of AudioSet, great progress has been made in advancing model performance, which mostly comes from the development of novel model architectures and attention modules. However, we find that appropriate training techniques are equally important for building audio tagging models with AudioSet, but have not received the attention they deserve. To fill the gap, in this work, we present PSLA, a collection of model agnostic training techniques that can noticeably boost the model accuracy including ImageNet pretraining, balanced sampling, data augmentation, label enhancement, model aggregation. While many of these techniques have been previously explored, we conduct a thorough investigation on their design choices and combine them together. By training an EfficientNet with pretraining, balanced sampling, data augmentation, and model aggregation, we obtain a single model (with 13.6 M parameters) and an ensemble model that achieve mean average precision (mAP) scores of 0.444 and 0.474 on AudioSet, respectively, outperforming the previous best system of 0.439 with 81 M parameters. In addition, our model also achieves a new state-of-the-art mAP of 0.567 on FSD50K.

Therefore, a scheme of artificial noise (AN) cooperative jamming and beamforming design is proposed against internal eavesdropper for RIS-aided NOMA in this paper. It is proved theoretically that the positive secrecy rate can be guaranteed if providing sufficient power. In addition, the power allocation of base station is further studied to minimize the total power consumption under the constraints of data rate and secrecy rate, and the closed-form solutions are achieved. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed scheme is superior to the existing solutions.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3120725","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09576691.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3120725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","startPage":"142105","endPage":"142113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Secure Design for RIS-Aided NOMA Network Against Internal Near-End Eavesdropping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9576691","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust Secure Design for RIS-Aided NOMA Network Against Internal Near-End Eavesdropping","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9576691/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9576691/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Key Research and Development Plan of Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2019ZDLGY07-02"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501347"},{"fundingName":"\u201c111\u201d Project","grantNumber":"B08038"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Robust Secure Design for RIS-Aided NOMA Network Against Internal Near-End Eavesdropping","sourcePdf":"access-zhang-3120725-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089237S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9576691","onlineDate":"15 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":9576697,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Cheng","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Optical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9681827/9576697/cheng-3120721-small.gif","p":["Xin Cheng received the B.S. degree from the Nanjing University of Science and Technology, China, in 2018, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Electronic and Optical Engineering.

In this paper, we study a free-space RIS-assisted multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication system in far-field operation. To maximize the received power from the physical and electromagnetic nature point of view, a comprehensive optimization, including beamforming of the transmitter, phase shifts of the RIS, orientation and position of the RIS is formulated and addressed. After exploiting the property of line-of-sight (LoS) links, we derive closed-form solutions of beamforming and phase shifts. For the non-trivial RIS position optimization problem in arbitrary three-dimensional space, a dimensional-reducing theory is proved. The simulation results show that the proposed closed-form beamforming and phase shifts approach the upper bound of the received power. The robustness of our proposed solutions in terms of the perturbation is also verified. Moreover, the RIS significantly enhances the performance of the mmWave/THz communication system.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3120721","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3120721","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","startPage":"606","endPage":"620","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09576697.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9576697","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Array signal processing","Transmitters","Electromagnetics","Receivers","Optimization","MISO communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reconfigurable intelligent surface","intelligent reflecting surface","far-field","closed-form beamforming and phase shifts","position optimization","millimeter wave communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Joint Optimization for RIS-Assisted Wireless Communications: From Physical and Electromagnetic Perspectives","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"70","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9576697/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9576697/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62071234 and 61771244"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005693","fundingName":"Scientific Research Fund Project of Hainan University","grantNumber":"KYQD(ZR)-21008 and KYQD(ZR)-21007"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Optimization for RIS-Assisted Wireless Communications: From Physical and Electromagnetic Perspectives","sourcePdf":"tcomm-shu-3120721-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114588S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9576697","onlineDate":"15 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9576698,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Security, Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Ming Li received the bachelor\u2019s degree in mathematics from the China University of Geosciences, Beijing, in 2008, the master\u2019s degree in mathematics from Xiamen University in 2013, and the Ph.D. degree in information security from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2017.

The unified algorithm includes the existing adaptive-learning-rate optimization algorithms, such as Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Adaptive Mean Square Gradient (AMSGrad), Adam with weighted gradient and dynamic bound of learning rate (GWDC), AMSGrad with weighted gradient and dynamic bound of learning rate (AMSGWDC), and Adapting stepsizes by the belief in observed gradients (AdaBelief). The paper also gives convergence analyses of the unified algorithm for constant and diminishing learning rates. When using a constant learning rate, the algorithm can approximate a stationary point of a nonconvex stochastic optimization problem. When using a diminishing rate, it converges to a stationary point of the problem. Hence, the analyses lead to the finding that the existing adaptive-learning-rate optimization algorithms can be applied to nonconvex stochastic optimization in deep neural networks in theory. Additionally, this paper provides numerical results showing that the unified algorithm can train deep neural networks in practice. Moreover, it provides numerical comparisons for unconstrained minimization using benchmark functions of the unified algorithm with certain heuristic intelligent optimization algorithms. The numerical comparisons show that a teaching-learning-based optimization algorithm and the unified algorithm perform well.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3120749","startPage":"143807","endPage":"143823","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3120749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09576705.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unified Algorithm Framework for Nonconvex Stochastic Optimization in Deep Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9576705/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Unified Algorithm Framework for Nonconvex Stochastic Optimization in Deep Neural Networks","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9576705/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI","grantNumber":"21K11773"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Unified Algorithm Framework for Nonconvex Stochastic Optimization in Deep Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"access-zhu-3120749-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146133S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9576705","onlineDate":"15 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9576712,"authors":[{"name":"Michele Morelli","affiliation":["University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9681827/9576712/morel-3120735-small.gif","p":["Michele Morelli (Senior Member, IEEE) received the Laurea degree (cum laude) in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in telecommunication engineering from the University of Pisa, Italy, in 1991.","From 1992 to 1995, he was with the Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa.

This work presents further investigations on this problem with regards to the fine estimation task, which is accomplished through a suitable interpolation of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) coefficients of the observation data. The focus is on fast real-time applications, where iterative estimation methods can hardly be applied due to their latency and complexity. After deriving the analytical expression of the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (CRB) for general values of the system parameters, we present a new DFT interpolation scheme based on the weighted least-squares (WLS) rule, where the optimum weights are precomputed through a numerical search and stored in the receiver. In contrast to many existing alternatives, the proposed method can employ an arbitrary number of DFT samples so as to achieve a good trade-off between system performance and complexity. Simulation results and theoretical analysis indicate that, at sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratios, the estimation accuracy is close to the relevant CRB at any value of the frequency error. This provides some advantage with respect to non-iterative competing schemes, without incurring any penalty in processing requirement.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9576712/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","volume":"70","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9576712/","displayDocTitle":"Single-Tone Frequency Estimation by Weighted Least-Squares Interpolation of Fourier Coefficients","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Italian Ministry of Education and Research (MIUR) in the framework of the CrossLab project (Departments of Excellence)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Tone Frequency Estimation by Weighted Least-Squares Interpolation of Fourier Coefficients","sourcePdf":"tcomm-moretti-3120735-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087707S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9576712","onlineDate":"15 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9576714,"authors":[{"name":"Zahra Mokhtari","affiliation":["Science and Technology Park and School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"p":["Zahra Mokhtari received the B.Sc. degree from the University of Yazd, Yazd, Iran, in 2011, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 2013 and 2019, respectively, all in electrical engineering.

Studying the performance of these systems in practical scenarios such as in the presence of hardware impairments is of vital importance. In this paper, we study the effect of power amplifier non-linearity on the uplink and downlink sum-rate of CF mMIMO systems. We derive closed form expressions for the uplink and downlink achievable sum-rates of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based CF mMIMO systems. Our results show that in the uplink the sum-rate does not increase unlimitedly as the number of access points (AP) increases, being upper bounded, contrarily to the ideal linear case. In fact, the rate of each user is limited by the distortion signal of its power amplifier. However, in the downlink, the sum-rate of the system with non-linear power amplifiers is not bounded and increases unlimitedly with the number of APs. Our results also indicate that for the same signal to distortion ratio (SDR) at the power amplifier output or the same normalized saturation level of the power amplifiers, the relative downlink sum-rate degradation is lower than the relative uplink sum-rate degradation (both with respect to their corresponding values in the ideal linear case). In fact, our results confirm that the user side power amplifier non-linearity has higher impact on the system performance than the power amplifier non-linearity on the AP antennas.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3120925","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09576714.pdf","startPage":"141927","endPage":"141937","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3120925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sum-Rate of Cell Free Massive MIMO Systems With Power Amplifier Non-Linearity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9576714","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9576714/","displayDocTitle":"Sum-Rate of Cell Free Massive MIMO Systems With Power Amplifier Non-Linearity","volume":"9","publicationDate":"2021","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9576714/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001871","fundingName":"Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100015494","fundingName":"Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es","grantNumber":"UIDB/50008/2020"},{"fundingName":"Project MASSIVE5G (POCI-01-0145-FEDER-030588 and PTDC/EEI-TEL/30588/2017)","grantNumber":"SAICT-45-2017-02"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Sum-Rate of Cell Free Massive MIMO Systems With Power Amplifier Non-Linearity","sourcePdf":"access-mokhtari-3120925-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096852S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9576714","onlineDate":"15 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":9576719,"authors":[{"name":"Omer Narmanlioglu","affiliation":["resides, Ankara, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9681827/9576719/narma-3120719-small.gif","p":["Omer Narmanlioglu received the B.Sc. degree from the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey, in 2014, the M.Sc. degree from Ozyegin University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2016, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Ozyegin University, in 2020.

It is particularly attractive for user-dense environments and mainly positioned as a complementary wireless access technology to radio-frequency (RF) counterparts. The practical implementation of hybrid light/radio access networks requires the design of efficient vertical and horizontal handover mechanisms to exploit their complementary features. In this paper, we propose an event-triggered adaptive handover mechanism for centralized hybrid VLC/millimeter wave (MMW) systems. Unlike distributed architectures where all the functionalities are deployed in each access point (AP), the centralized systems allow better optimization of network parameters due to awareness of global network view. The proposed handover mechanism takes advantage of this architecture and uses offset-enhanced signal-to-interference plus noise ratio levels of APs as performance metrics. To ensure balanced distribution of user equipment (UE) numbers between two underlying technologies, it auto-tunes the offset variables using rule-set based algorithms based on the number of connected UEs and data rates as inputs. Our results demonstrate that the proposed handover mechanism significantly improves hybrid system performance via adaptive tuning of AP selection parameter while minimizing signaling overhead.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3120719","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09576719.pdf","startPage":"455","endPage":"468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3120719","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Event-Triggered Adaptive Handover for Centralized Hybrid VLC/MMW Networks","volume":"70","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9576719/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9576719/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event-Triggered Adaptive Handover for Centralized Hybrid VLC/MMW Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-narmanlioglu-3120719-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10946S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9576719","onlineDate":"15 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9576724,"authors":[{"name":"Ilan Shomorony","affiliation":["University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign (UIUC), Urbana, IL, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ilan Shomorony (Member, IEEE) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Cornell University in 2014.

Since the non-affine system is with the implicit control input in dynamic equation, it is a more general modeling form than the affine case, hence this also makes the optimized control more challenging and rewarding. However, most existing RL-based optimal controllers are very complex in algorithm because their actor and critic training laws obtained by implementing gradient descent on the square of Bellman residual error, which equals to the approximation of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, hence these methods are difficult to be extended to non-affine systems. In this optimized control, the RL algorithm is produced from implementing gradient descent to a simple positive-definite function, which is derived from HJB equation\u2019s partial derivative. As a result, the proposed control algorithm can be significantly simple so as to alleviate the computational burden. Finally, a typical numerical simulation is carried out, and the results also further confirm effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3120835","startPage":"141758","endPage":"141765","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3120835","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09576731.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Neural Network Optimized Control Using Reinforcement Learning of Critic-Actor Architecture for a Class of Non-Affine Nonlinear Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9576731/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Neural Network Optimized Control Using Reinforcement Learning of Critic-Actor Architecture for a Class of Non-Affine Nonlinear Systems","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9576731/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007129","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province","grantNumber":"ZR2020MF097"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62073045 and 61973185"},{"fundingName":"Development Plan of Young Innovation Team in the colleges and universities of Shandong Province","grantNumber":"2019KJN011"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Adaptive Neural Network Optimized Control Using Reinforcement Learning of Critic-Actor Architecture for a Class of Non-Affine Nonlinear Systems","sourcePdf":"access-li-3120835-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108369S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9576731","onlineDate":"15 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9576733,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos F.

The proposed evolution process can flexibly control rays\u2019 lifespans and smoothness of (dis)appearance in both space and time domains. In addition, we propose an improved Rayleigh-distance criterion to determine the most adequate wavefront for each cluster and ray. Existing models can easily implement the proposed criterion and make a more efficient use of computation resources. Also, a Gamma-Poisson mixture distribution is introduced to model the distribution of the number of clusters when multiple locations of the mobile station are considered.

Specifically, while designing the feature extraction network, the cross-stage-partial-connections (CSP) module in the shallow layer is expanded and iterated to maximize the use of shallow features. In addition, an improved attention module is introduced in residual blocks to focus on objects and suppress background. Moreover, multiscale detection is added to improve small object detection accuracy. Experimental results on the KAIST and FLIR datasets show that YOLO-FIRI demonstrates a qualitative improvement compared with the state-of-the-art detectors. Compared with YOLOv4, the mean average precision (mAP50) of YOLO-FIRI is increased by 21% on the KAIST dataset, the speed is reduced by 62%, the parameters are decreased by 89%, the weight size is reduced by more than 94%, and the computational costs are reduced by 84%. Compared with YOLO-FIR, YOLO-FIRI has an approximately 5% to 20% improvement in AP, AR (average recall), mAP50, F1, and mAP50:75. Furthermore, due to the shortcomings of high noise and weak features, image fusion can be applied to image preprocessing as a data enhancement method by fusing visible and infrared images based on a convolutional neural network.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3120870","startPage":"141861","endPage":"141875","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3120870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09576741.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"YOLO-FIRI: Improved YOLOv5 for Infrared Image Object Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9576741/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"YOLO-FIRI: Improved YOLOv5 for Infrared Image Object Detection","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9576741/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Key Research and Development and Promotion Projects in Henan Province","grantNumber":"212102210151"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1704130"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"YOLO-FIRI: Improved YOLOv5 for Infrared Image Object Detection","sourcePdf":"access-li-3120870-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162231S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9576741","onlineDate":"15 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9576742,"authors":[{"name":"Hongwei Liu","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"p":["Hongwei Liu received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics from Hubei University in 1992 and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in pure mathematics from Wuhan University in 2000 and 2003, respectively.

However, an efficient screening of COVID-19 is still a huge task due to the spatial complexity of CXRs. In this paper, a dense convolutional neural network (DCov-Net) based transfer learning model is proposed for the screening of COVID-19 suspected subjects using CXR images. A modified multi-crossover genetic algorithm (MMCGA) is then proposed to tune the hyper-parameters of DCov-Net. Majority of the existing COVID-19 diagnosis models are not interpretable as they do not provide any transparency to the users. Therefore, the concept of heat-maps is used to achieve explainability and interpretability. MMCGA based DCov-Net is implemented on a multiclass dataset that contains four different classes. Experimental results reveal that MMCGA based DCov-Net achieves better performance than the existing models. The proposed MMCGA based DCov-Net can be utilized for initial screening of COVID-19 suspected subjects with an accuracy of 99.34 \u00b1 0.51 %.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09576746.pdf","startPage":"142566","endPage":"142580","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3120717","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3120717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9576746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Screening of COVID-19 Suspected Subjects Using Multi-Crossover Genetic Algorithm Based Dense Convolutional Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["COVID-19","Feature extraction","Computed tomography","Support vector machines","Pulmonary diseases","Transfer learning","Image segmentation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["COVID-19","diagnosis","chest-CT","ensemble","deep learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9576746/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Screening of COVID-19 Suspected Subjects Using Multi-Crossover Genetic Algorithm Based Dense Convolutional Neural Network","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9576746/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Government of Korea (MSIP)","grantNumber":"NRF-2021R1A2B5B03002118"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Screening of COVID-19 Suspected Subjects Using Multi-Crossover Genetic Algorithm Based Dense Convolutional Neural Network","society":["IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Section"],"sourcePdf":"access-lee-3120717-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125708S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9576746","onlineDate":"15 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":9576749,"authors":[{"name":"Venkatesan Guruswami","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Venkatesan Guruswami (Fellow, IEEE) received the bachelor\u2019s degree from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in 1997 and the Ph.D. degree from MIT in 2001.","He is currently a Professor with the Department of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, and the Director of its Ph.D. Program.

Our result thus precisely characterizes the feasibility region of binary list-decodable codes for insertions and deletions.

We achieve this via an intricate analysis of codes introduced by [Bukh and Ma, 2014].

Typically, hundreds, if not thousands, of independent antenna channels are used to achieve high SNR for throughput and increased capacity. Using a dedicated ADC per antenna receiver is preferable but it\u2019s not practical for very large arrays due to unreasonable cost and complexity. Frequency division multiplexing (FDM) is a well-known technique for combining multiple signals into a single wideband channel. In a first of its kind measurements, this paper explores FDM for combining multiple antenna outputs at IF into a single wideband signal that can be sampled and digitized using a high-speed wideband ADC. The sampled signals are sub-band filtered and digitally down-converted to obtain individual antenna channels. A prototype receiver was realized with a uniform linear array consisting of 4 elements with 250 MHz bandwidth per channel at 28 GHz carrier frequency. Each of the receiver chains were frequency-multiplexed at an intermediate frequency of 1 GHz to avoid the requirement for multiple, precise local oscillators (LOs). Combined narrowband receiver outputs were sampled using a single ADC with digital front-end operating on a Xilinx ZCU-1285 RF SoC FPGA to synthesize 4 digital beams.

Moreover, quantum error correction must be implemented based on imperfect parity check measurements that may return incorrect outcomes or inject additional faults into the qubits. To achieve fault-tolerant error correction, Shor proposed to repeat the sequence of parity check measurements until the same outcome is observed sufficiently many times. Then, one can use this information to perform error correction. A basic implementation of this fault tolerance strategy requires \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\Omega (r d^{2})$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n parity check measurements for a distance-\n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$d$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n code defined by \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$r$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n parity checks. For some specific highly structured quantum codes, Bombin has shown that single-shot fault-tolerant quantum error correction is possible using only \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$r$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n measurements. In this work, we consider a phenomenological noise model for parity check measurements assuming that each bit of a codeword and the measurement outcome suffer from independent bit flips with some error rate \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$p$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n. For this model, we demonstrate that fault-tolerant quantum error correction can be achieved using \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$O(d \\log (d))$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n measurements for any code with distance \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$d \\geq \\Omega (n^\\alpha)$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n for some constant \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\alpha &gt; 0$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n. Moreover, we prove the existence of a sub-single-shot fault-tolerant quantum error correction scheme using fewer than \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$r$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n measurements. In some cases, the number of parity check measurements required for fault-tolerant quantum error correction is exponentially smaller than the number of parity checks defining the code. The short measurement sequences constructed generally have high weight and our phenomenological noise model is not realistic in this regime. Our error correction strategy could find applications to small codes and LDPC codes if one can manage to keep the weight of the measured parity checks low.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Measurement uncertainty","Fault tolerant systems","Fault tolerance","Error correction","Error correction codes","Linear codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quantum computing","error correction"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9660615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3120685","startPage":"287","endPage":"301","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/9660615/09576754.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2021.3120685","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beyond Single-Shot Fault-Tolerant Quantum Error Correction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Beyond Single-Shot Fault-Tolerant Quantum Error Correction","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","volume":"68","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9576754/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9576754/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beyond Single-Shot Fault-Tolerant Quantum Error Correction","sourcePdf":"tit-delfosse-3120685-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128704S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9660615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9660615","articleId":"9576754","onlineDate":"15 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":9576764,"authors":[{"name":"Loc Tan Ho","affiliation":["University of Science, Ho Chi Minh City 70000, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Loc Tan","lastName":"Ho"},{"name":"Son Thai Tran","affiliation":["University of Science, Ho Chi Minh City 70000, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Son Thai","lastName":"Tran"},{"name":"Dien Dinh","affiliation":["University of Science, Ho Chi Minh City 70000, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Dien","lastName":"Dinh"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3592-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3591-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1178-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2642-6471"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2373-681X"}],"articleNumber":"9576764","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Conferences","Brightness","Ink","Generative adversarial networks","Feature extraction","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["background elimination","Generative Adversarial Networks","character extraction","image reprocessing","Nom script"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9576764","abstract":"In this research, we present a new technique to improve the performance of a Nom-character recognition system.

Additionally, this research identifies neural network architecture and training conditions for use in an automated train cleaning robot. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between the size of the CNN training dataset, whether these images are taken from a view sympathetic to the CNN application, and the effectiveness of the trained networks. Three datasets were constructed specifically for this research; a large dataset of 58,300 studio images of waste in a variety of conditions, a smaller dataset of 4,515 images taken of actual waste items on trains, and a dataset of 7,290 images of actual waste on trains used to test the CNNs. The images taken on trains were captured from the perspective of a hypothetical cleaning robot that would use these networks. Additionally, we provide a comparison of MobileNetV2, ShuffleNet, and SqueezeNet CNNs based on their suitability for implementation in an automated train cleaning system, and the optimum conditions to do so. Training with a smaller dataset of images taken from a \u201crobot-eye view\u201d resulted in an average increase in classification accuracy of 10.5%, with the largest increase being 26%, when compared to training with a larger dataset of images of waste items in various poses. ShuffleNet was identified as the optimally performing CNN for waste detection, achieving an accuracy of 88.61% when trained with a small dataset of images sympathetic to the end use. MobileNetV2 was found to perform optimally with a larger dataset of training images, even if these are less specific to the application of the

Profanity Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network","abstract":"Foul language exists in films, video-sharing platforms, and social media platforms, which increase the risk of a viewer to be exposed to large number of profane words that have negative personal and social impact. This work proposes a CNN-based spoken Malay foul words recognition to establish the base of spoken foul terms detection for monitoring and censorship purpose. A novel foul speech containing 1512 samples are collected, processed, and annotated. The dataset then has been converted into spectral representation of Mel-spectrogram images to be used as an input to CNN model. This research proposes a lightweight CNN model with only six convolutional layers and small size filters to minimize the computational cost. The proposed model\u2019s performance affirms the viability of the proposed visual-based classification method using CNN by achieving an average Malay foul speech terms classification accuracy of 86.50%, precision of 88.68%, and F-score of 86.83. The class of normal conversational class outperformed the class of foul words due to data imbalance and rarity of foul speech samples compared to normal speech terms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9576781/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9576781/","publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2021","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Spoken Malay Profanity Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spoken Malay Profanity Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"010202-1570715038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061874S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9576761","isNumber":"9576762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9576761","xplore-issue":"9576762","articleId":"9576781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":9576789,"authors":[{"name":"Norezmi Jamal","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Norezmi","lastName":"Jamal","id":"37086808271"},{"name":"Norfaiza Fuad","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Norfaiza","lastName":"Fuad","id":"38469292800"},{"name":"Shahnoor Shanta","affiliation":["School of Computing and Digital Media, London Metropolitan University, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Shahnoor","lastName":"Shanta","id":"37086077499"},{"name":"Mohd Nurul Al-Hafiz Sha\u2019abani","affiliation":["Centre for Diploma Studies, Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohd Nurul Al-Hafiz","lastName":"Sha\u2019abani","id":"37087071157"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3592-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3591-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1178-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2642-6471"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2373-681X"}],"articleNumber":"9576789","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":18},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Training","Image processing","Conferences","Sociology","Estimation","Speech enhancement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["monaural","speech enhancement","deep neural network","cross-dataset"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9576789","abstract":"Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based mask estimation approach is an emerging algorithm in monaural speech enhancement. It is used to enhance speech signals from the noisy background by calculating either speech or noise dominant in a particular frame of the noisy speech signal. It can construct complex models for nonlinear processing. However, the limitation of the DNN-based mask algorithm is a generalization of the targeted population. Past research works focused on their target dataset because of time consumption for the audio recording session. Thus, in this work, different recording conditions were used to study the performance of the DNN-based mask estimation approach. The findings revealed that different language test dataset, as well as different conditions, may not give large impact in speech enhancement performance since the algorithm only learn the noise information. But, the performance of speech enhancement is promising when the trained model has been designed properly, especially given the less sample variations in the input dataset involved during the training session.","doi":"10.1109/ICSIPA52582.2021.9576789","pdfPath":"/iel7/9576761/9576762/09576789.pdf","startPage":"44","endPage":"49","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Signal and Image Processing Applications (ICSIPA)","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Signal and Image Processing Applications (ICSIPA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSIPA52582.2021.9576789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9576762","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monaural Speech Enhancement using Deep Neural Network with Cross-Speech Dataset","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9576789/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Monaural Speech Enhancement using Deep Neural Network with Cross-Speech Dataset","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2021","publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9576789/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007837","fundingName":"Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monaural Speech Enhancement using Deep Neural Network with Cross-Speech Dataset","confLoc":"Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"010204-1570735302.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081671S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9576761","isNumber":"9576762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9576761","xplore-issue":"9576762","articleId":"9576789","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":9576805,"authors":[{"name":"Kin Wai Lee","affiliation":["Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Kin Wai","lastName":"Lee","id":"37088560014"},{"name":"Renee Ka Yin Chin","affiliation":["Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Renee Ka Yin","lastName":"Chin","id":"37088999532"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3592-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3591-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1178-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2642-6471"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2373-681X"}],"articleNumber":"9576805","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["COVID-19","Three-dimensional displays","Pulmonary diseases","Computed tomography","Image processing","Lung cancer","Lung"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["COVID-19 screening","pneumonia detection","data processing","chest computerized tomography"]}],"abstract":"Medical imaging modalities have been showing great potentials for faster and efficient disease transmission control and containment.

In this study, a smart flight controller is developed for controlling UAVs which produces operator less mechanisms for flight controllers. It uses a neural network that has been trained using reinforcement learning techniques. Engineered with a variety of actuators (pitch, yaw, roll, and speed), the next-generation flight controller is directly trained to control its own decisions in flight. It also optimizes learning algorithms different from the traditional Actor and Critic networks. The agent gets state information from the environment and calculates the reward function depending on the sensors data from the environment. The agent then receives the observations to identify the state and reward functions and the agent activates the algorithm to perform actions. It shows the performance of a trained neural network consisting of a reward function in both simulation and real-time UAV control. Experimental results show that it can respond with relative precision. Using the same framework shows that UAVs can reliably hover in the air, even under adverse initialization conditions with obstacles.

Existing methods typically train deep models by treating the entire image as a whole yet put little effort into learning the local distribution, which is vital for this pixel-precise task. In this work, we propose an unsupervised patch-based approach that gives due consideration to both the global and local information. More concretely, we employ a Local-Net and Global-Net to extract features from any individual patch and its surrounding respectively. Global-Net is trained with the purpose to mimic the local feature such that we can easily detect an abnormal patch when its feature mismatches that from the context. We further introduce an Inconsistency Anomaly Detection (IAD) head and a Distortion Anomaly Detection (DAD) head to sufficiently spot the discrepancy between global and local features. A scoring function derived from the multi-head design facilitates high-precision anomaly localization. Extensive experiments on a couple of real-world datasets suggest that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art competitors by a sufficiently large margin.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Glancing at the Patch: Anomaly Localization with Global and Local Feature Comparison","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","doi":"10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00032","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9577055/9577056/09577292.pdf","startPage":"254","endPage":"263","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9577056","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9577292","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9577292/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2021","displayDocTitle":"Glancing at the Patch: Anomaly Localization with Global and Local Feature Comparison","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9577292/","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2021","publicationDate":"June 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Glancing at the Patch: Anomaly Localization with Global and Local Feature Comparison","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"450900a254.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.125763S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9577055","isNumber":"9577056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9577055","xplore-issue":"9577056","articleId":"9577292","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9577352,"authors":[{"name":"Yangchen Xie","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Multidimensional Information Processing, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yangchen","lastName":"Xie","id":"37089013115"},{"name":"Xinyuan Chen","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Multidimensional Information Processing, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xinyuan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37088933966"},{"name":"Li Sun","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Multidimensional Information Processing, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Sun","id":"37086342303"},{"name":"Yue Lu","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Multidimensional Information Processing, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Lu","id":"37280555100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4509-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4510-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-7075"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"9577352","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":16},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deformable models","Computer vision","Convolution","Image color analysis","Computational modeling","Supervised learning","Writing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9577352","abstract":"Font generation is a challenging problem especially for some writing systems that consist of a large number of characters and has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. However, existing methods for font generation are often in supervised learning. They require a large number of paired data, which is labor-intensive and expensive to collect. Besides, common image-to-image translation models often define style as the set of textures and colors, which cannot be directly applied to font generation. To address these problems, we propose novel deformable generative networks for unsupervised font generation (DG-Font). We introduce a feature deformation skip connection (FDSC) which predicts pairs of displacement maps and employs the predicted maps to apply deformable convolution to the low-level feature maps from the content encoder. The outputs of FDSC are fed into a mixer to generate the final results. Taking advantage of FDSC, the mixer outputs a high-quality character with a complete structure. To further improve the quality of generated images, we use three deformable convolution layers in the content encoder to learn style-invariant feature representations. Experiments demonstrate that our model generates characters in higher quality than state-of-art methods.

RD performs in a meta-learning way to obtain a learning ability to filter the distractors from the background while RM aims to effectively integrate the proposed RD into the Siamese framework to generate accurate tracking result. Moreover, to further improve the discriminability and robustness of the tracker, we introduce a contrastive training strategy that attempts not only to learn matching the same target but also to learn how to distinguish the different objects. Therefore, our tracker can achieve accurate tracking results when facing background clutters, fast motion, and occlusion. Experimental results on five popular benchmarks, including VOT2018, VOT2019, OTB100, LaSOT, and UAV123, show that the proposed method is effective and can achieve state-of-the-art results.

Because it helps remove spatial redundancies among latent representations. However, the decoding process must be done in a strict scan order, which breaks the parallelization. We propose a parallelizable checkerboard context model (CCM) to solve the problem. Our two-pass checkerboard context calculation eliminates such limitations on spatial locations by re-organizing the decoding order. Speeding up the decoding process more than 40 times in our experiments, it achieves significantly improved computational efficiency with almost the same rate-distortion performance.

However, annotating videos with frame-wise labels to train such models is very expensive and time consuming. While weakly supervised methods trained using only ordered action lists require less annotation effort, the performance is still worse than fully supervised approaches. In this paper, we propose to use timestamp supervision for the temporal action segmentation task. Timestamps require a comparable annotation effort to weakly supervised approaches, and yet provide a more supervisory signal. To demonstrate the effectiveness of timestamp supervision, we propose an approach to train a segmentation model using only timestamps annotations. Our approach uses the model output and the annotated timestamps to generate frame-wise labels by detecting the action changes. We further introduce a confidence loss that forces the predicted probabilities to monotonically decrease as the distance to the timestamps increases. This ensures that all and not only the most distinctive frames of an action are learned during training. The evaluation on four datasets shows that models trained with timestamps annotations achieve comparable performance to the fully supervised approaches.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9577056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00826","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9577055/9577056/09577408.pdf","startPage":"8361","endPage":"8370","doi":"10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temporal Action Segmentation from Timestamp Supervision","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2021","displayDocTitle":"Temporal Action Segmentation from Timestamp Supervision","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9577408/","publicationDate":"June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9577408/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001659","fundingName":"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temporal Action Segmentation from Timestamp Supervision","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"450900i361.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100231S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9577055","isNumber":"9577056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9577055","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9577056","articleId":"9577408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-06"},{"_id":9577435,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Sepas-Moghaddam","affiliation":["Queen\u2019s University, Kingston, Canada"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Sepas-Moghaddam","id":"38290796400"},{"name":"Fernando Pereira","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico - Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Pereira","id":"37290921400"},{"name":"Paulo Lobato Correia","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico - Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal"],"firstName":"Paulo Lobato","lastName":"Correia","id":"37368835900"},{"name":"Ali Etemad","affiliation":["Queen\u2019s University, Kingston, Canada"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Etemad","id":"37087028037"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4509-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4510-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-7075"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"9577435","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":9},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9577435","abstract":"We present a novel LSTM cell architecture capable of learning both intra- and inter-perspective relationships available in visual sequences captured from multiple perspectives.

However, most of the existing methods need to train a new model for a new domain by accessing data. Due to public privacy, the new domain data are not always accessible, leading to a limited applicability of these methods. In this paper, we study the problem of multi-source domain generalization in ReID, which aims to learn a model that can perform well on unseen domains with only several labeled source domains. To address this problem, we propose the Memory-based Multi-Source Meta-Learning (M\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\nL) framework to train a generalizable model for unseen domains. Specifically, a meta-learning strategy is introduced to simulate the train-test process of domain generalization for learning more generalizable models. To overcome the unstable meta-optimization caused by the parametric classifier, we propose a memory-based identification loss that is non-parametric and harmonizes with meta-learning. We also present a meta batch normalization layer (MetaBN) to diversify meta-test features, further establishing the advantage of meta-learning.

Such cameras record event streams with much shorter response latency than images captured by conventional cameras, and are also highly sensitive to intensity change, which is brought by the triggering mechanism of events. On the basis of these two features, previous works attempt to reconstruct high speed and high dynamic range (HDR) videos from events. However, these works either suffer from unrealistic artifacts, or cannot provide sufficiently high frame rate. In this paper, we present a convolutional recurrent neural network which takes a sequence of neighboring events to reconstruct high speed HDR videos, and temporal consistency is well considered to facilitate the training process. In addition, we setup a prototype optical system to collect a real-world dataset with paired high speed HDR videos and event streams, which will be made publicly accessible for future researches in this field. Experimental results on both simulated and real scenes verify that our method can generate high speed HDR videos with high quality, and outperform the state-of-the-art reconstruction methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Recurrent neural networks","Reconstruction algorithms","Dynamic range","Streaming media","Cameras","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","image reconstruction","image sensors","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","recurrent neural nets","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high dynamic range videos","event cameras","cameras record event streams","conventional cameras","sufficiently high frame rate","paired high speed HDR videos"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00206","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9577055/9577056/09577497.pdf","startPage":"2024","endPage":"2033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9577056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Reconstruct High Speed and High Dynamic Range Videos from Events","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9577497","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Reconstruct High Speed and High Dynamic Range Videos from Events","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9577497/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9577497/","accessionNumber":"21274778","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Reconstruct High Speed and High Dynamic Range Videos from Events","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"450900c024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128136S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9577055","isNumber":"9577056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9577055","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9577056","articleId":"9577497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9577530,"authors":[{"name":"Wanhua Li","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, China","Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Wanhua","lastName":"Li","id":"37087231595"},{"name":"Shiwei Wang","affiliation":["School of Modern Post, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Shiwei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089016333"},{"name":"Jiwen Lu","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, China","Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Jiwen","lastName":"Lu","id":"37404390100"},{"name":"Jianjiang Feng","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, China","Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Jianjiang","lastName":"Feng","id":"37399558100"},{"name":"Jie Zhou","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, China","Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37278266700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4509-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4510-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-7075"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"9577530","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":9},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9577530","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Computer vision","Databases","Computational modeling","Pattern recognition"]}],"abstract":"Kinship verification aims to find out whether there is a kin relation for a given pair of facial images. Kinship verification databases are born with unbalanced data. For a database with N positive kinship pairs, we naturally obtain N(N \u2212 1) negative pairs. How to fully utilize the limited positive pairs and mine discriminative information from sufficient negative samples for kinship verification remains an open issue. To address this problem, we propose a Discriminative Sample Meta-Mining (DSMM) approach in this paper. Unlike existing methods that usually construct a balanced dataset with fixed negative pairs, we propose to utilize all possible pairs and automatically learn discriminative information from data. Specifically, we sample an unbalanced train batch and a balanced meta-train batch for each iteration. Then we learn a meta-miner with the meta-gradient on the balanced meta-train batch. In the end, the samples in the unbalanced train batch are re-weighted by the learned meta-miner to optimize the kinship models. Experimental results on the widely used KinFaceW-I, KinFaceW-II, TSKinFace, and Cornell Kinship datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9577056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.01587","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9577055/9577056/09577530.pdf","startPage":"16130","endPage":"16139","doi":"10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.01587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Meta-Mining Discriminative Samples for Kinship Verification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2021","displayDocTitle":"Meta-Mining Discriminative Samples for Kinship Verification","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9577530/","publicationDate":"June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9577530/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Meta-Mining Discriminative Samples for Kinship Verification","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"450900q6130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107558S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9577055","isNumber":"9577056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9577055","xplore-issue":"9577056","articleId":"9577530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9577542,"authors":[{"name":"Dongyu She","affiliation":["Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Dongyu","lastName":"She","id":"37086426779"},{"name":"Yu-Kun Lai","affiliation":["Cardiff University"],"firstName":"Yu-Kun","lastName":"Lai","id":"38575316500"},{"name":"Gaoxiong Yi","affiliation":["Tencent"],"firstName":"Gaoxiong","lastName":"Yi","id":"37089011446"},{"name":"Kun Xu","affiliation":["Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37957171700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4509-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4510-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-7075"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"9577542","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":12},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9577542","abstract":"Learning computational models of image aesthetics can have a substantial impact on visual art and graphic design. Although automatic image aesthetics assessment is a challenging topic by its subjective nature, psychological studies have confirmed a strong correlation between image layouts and perceived image quality. While previous state-of-the-art methods attempt to learn holistic information using deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), our approach is motivated by the fact that Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) architecture is conceivably more suited for modeling complex relations among image regions than vanilla convolutional layers. Specifically, we present a Hierarchical Layout-Aware Graph Convolutional Network (HLA-GCN) to capture layout information. It is a dedicated double-subnet neural network consisting of two LA-GCN modules. The first LA-GCN module constructs an aesthetics-related graph in the coordinate space and performs reasoning over spatial nodes. The second LA-GCN module performs graph reasoning after aggregating significant regions in a latent space. The model output is a hierarchical representation with layout-aware features from both spatial and aggregated nodes for unified aesthetics assessment. Extensive evaluations show that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art on the AVA and AADB datasets across three different tasks.

Existing FSS methods find the query object by using support prototypes or by directly relying on heuristic multi-scale feature fusion. However, they fail to fully leverage the high-order appearance relationships between multi-scale features among the support-query image pairs, thus leading to an inaccurate localization of the query objects. To tackle the above challenge, we propose an end-to-end scale-aware graph neural network (SAGNN) by reasoning the cross-scale relations among the support-query images for FSS. Specifically, a scale-aware graph is first built by taking support-induced multi-scale query features as nodes and, meanwhile, each edge is modeled as the pairwise interaction of its connected nodes. By progressive message passing over this graph, SAGNN is capable of capturing cross-scale relations and overcoming object variations (e.g., appearance, scale and location), and can thus learn more precise node embeddings. This in turn enables it to predict more accurate foreground objects. Moreover, to make full use of the location relations across scales for the query image, a novel self-node collaboration mechanism is proposed to enrich the current node, which endows SAGNN the ability of perceiving different resolutions of the same objects.

In this context, vector quantization is an appealing framework that expresses multiple parameters using a single code, and has recently achieved state-of-the-art network compression on a range of core vision and natural language processing tasks. Key to the success of vector quantization is deciding which parameter groups should be compressed together. Previous work has relied on heuristics that group the spatial dimension of individual convolutional filters, but a general solution remains unaddressed. This is desirable for pointwise convolutions (which dominate modern architectures), linear layers (which have no notion of spatial dimension), and convolutions (when more than one filter is compressed to the same codeword). In this paper we make the observation that the weights of two adjacent layers can be permuted while expressing the same function. We then establish a connection to rate-distortion theory and search for permutations that result in networks that are easier to compress. Finally, we rely on an annealed quantization algorithm to better compress the network and achieve higher final accuracy. We show results on image classification, object detection, and segmentation, reducing the gap with the uncompressed model by 40 to 70% w.r.t. the current state of the art.

However, an open problem in T-ZSL: how to effectively make use of unseen-class samples for training, still remains. Addressing this problem, we first empirically analyze the roles of unseen-class samples with different degrees of hardness in the training process based on the uneven prediction phenomenon found in many ZSL methods, resulting in three observations. Then, we propose two hardness sampling approaches for selecting a subset of diverse and hard samples from a given unseen-class dataset according to these observations. The first one identifies the samples based on the class-level frequency of the model predictions while the second enhances the former by normalizing the class frequency via an approximate class prior estimated by an explored prior estimation algorithm. Finally, we design a new Self-Training framework with Hardness Sampling for T-ZSL, called STHS, where an arbitrary inductive ZSL method could be seamlessly embedded and it is iteratively trained with unseen-class samples selected by the hardness sampling approach. We introduce two typical ZSL methods into the STHS framework and extensive experiments demonstrate that the derived T-ZSL methods outperform many state-of-the-art methods on three public benchmarks. Besides, we note that the unseen-class dataset is separately used for training in some existing transductive generalized ZSL (T-GZSL) methods, which is not strict for a GZSL task. Hence, we suggest a more strict T-GZSL data setting and establish a competitive baseline on this setting by introducing the proposed STHS framework to T-GZSL.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Computer vision","Estimation","Predictive models","Benchmark testing","Prediction algorithms","Approximation algorithms"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.01623","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9577055/9577056/09577772.pdf","startPage":"16494","endPage":"16503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9577056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.01623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardness Sampling for Self-Training Based Transductive Zero-Shot Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9577772","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hardness Sampling for Self-Training Based Transductive Zero-Shot Learning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9577772/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9577772/","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002367","fundingName":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardness Sampling for Self-Training Based Transductive Zero-Shot Learning","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"450900q6494.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106347S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9577055","isNumber":"9577056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9577055","xplore-issue":"9577056","articleId":"9577772","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9577791,"authors":[{"name":"Kohei Yamamoto","affiliation":["Oki Electric Industry Co., Ltd."],"firstName":"Kohei","lastName":"Yamamoto","id":"37088852844"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4509-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4510-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-7075"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"9577791","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Quantization (signal)","Limiting","Memory management","Neural networks","Object detection","Table lookup"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9577791","abstract":"Quantizing deep neural networks is an effective method for reducing memory consumption and improving inference speed, and is thus useful for implementation in resource-constrained devices. However, it is still hard for extremely low-bit models to achieve accuracy comparable with that of full-precision models. To address this issue, we propose learnable companding quantization (LCQ) as a novel non-uniform quantization method for 2-, 3-, and 4-bit models. LCQ jointly optimizes model weights and learnable companding functions that can flexibly and non-uniformly control the quantization levels of weights and activations. We also present a new weight normalization technique that allows more stable training for quantization. Experimental results show that LCQ outperforms conventional state-of-the-art methods and narrows the gap between quantized and full-precision models for image classification and object detection tasks. Notably, the 2-bit ResNet-50 model on ImageNet achieves top-1 accuracy of 75.1% and reduces the gap to 1.7%, allowing LCQ to further exploit the potential of non-uniform quantization.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00499","startPage":"5027","endPage":"5036","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00499","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9577056","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9577055/9577056/09577791.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learnable Companding Quantization for Accurate Low-bit Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9577791/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Learnable Companding Quantization for Accurate Low-bit Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9577791/","publicationDate":"June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001863","fundingName":"New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learnable Companding Quantization for Accurate Low-bit Neural Networks","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"450900f027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.145081S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9577055","isNumber":"9577056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9577055","xplore-issue":"9577056","articleId":"9577791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9577798,"authors":[{"name":"Tongyao Pang","affiliation":["National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Tongyao","lastName":"Pang","id":"37088454060"},{"name":"Huan Zheng","affiliation":["National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Huan","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37089011648"},{"name":"Yuhui Quan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yuhui","lastName":"Quan","id":"38233057100"},{"name":"Hui Ji","affiliation":["National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Ji","id":"37398695700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4509-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4510-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-7075"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"9577798","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":31},"abstract":"Deep denoiser, the deep network for denoising, has been the focus of the recent development on image denoising. In the last few years, there is an increasing interest in developing unsupervised deep denoisers which only call unorganized noisy images without ground truth for training. Nevertheless, the performance of these unsupervised deep denoisers is not competitive to their supervised counterparts. Aiming at developing a more powerful unsupervised deep denoiser, this paper proposed a data augmentation technique, called recorrupted-to-recorrupted (R2R), to address the overfitting caused by the absence of truth images. For each noisy image, we showed that the cost function defined on the noisy/noisy image pairs constructed by the R2R method is statistically equivalent to its supervised counterpart defined on the noisy/truth image pairs. Extensive experiments showed that the proposed R2R method noticeably outperformed existing unsupervised deep denoisers, and is competitive to representative supervised deep denoisers.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Deep learning","Computer vision","AWGN","Noise reduction","Cost function","Pattern recognition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00208","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9577055/9577056/09577798.pdf","startPage":"2043","endPage":"2052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9577056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recorrupted-to-Recorrupted: Unsupervised Deep Learning for Image Denoising","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9577798","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Recorrupted-to-Recorrupted: Unsupervised Deep Learning for Image Denoising","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9577798/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9577798/","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100015803","fundingName":"Tencent"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recorrupted-to-Recorrupted: Unsupervised Deep Learning for Image Denoising","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"450900c043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086573S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9577055","isNumber":"9577056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9577055","xplore-issue":"9577056","articleId":"9577798","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9577821,"authors":[{"name":"Despoina Paschalidou","affiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems T\u00fcbingen","Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems","NVIDIA"],"firstName":"Despoina","lastName":"Paschalidou","id":"37086260585"},{"name":"Angelos Katharopoulos","affiliation":["Idiap Research Institute, Switzerland","\u00c9cole Polytechique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL)"],"firstName":"Angelos","lastName":"Katharopoulos","id":"37086259114"},{"name":"Andreas Geiger","affiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems T\u00fcbingen","University of T\u00fcbingen","Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Geiger","id":"37393671000"},{"name":"Sanja Fidler","affiliation":["NVIDIA","University of Toronto","Vector Institute"],"firstName":"Sanja","lastName":"Fidler","id":"37689726500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4509-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4510-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-7075"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"9577821","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":19},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9577821","abstract":"Impressive progress in 3D shape extraction led to representations that can capture object geometries with high fidelity. In parallel, primitive-based methods seek to represent objects as semantically consistent part arrangements. However, due to the simplicity of existing primitive representations, these methods fail to accurately reconstruct 3D shapes using a small number of primitives/parts. We address the trade-off between reconstruction quality and number of parts with Neural Parts, a novel 3D primitive representation that defines primitives using an Invertible Neural Network (INN) which implements homeomorphic mappings between a sphere and the target object. The INN allows us to compute the inverse mapping of the homeomorphism, which in turn, enables the efficient computation of both the implicit surface function of a primitive and its mesh, without any additional post-processing. Our model learns to parse 3D objects into semantically consistent part arrangements without any part-level supervision. Evaluations on ShapeNet, D-FAUST and FreiHAND demonstrate that our primitives can capture complex geometries and thus simultaneously achieve geometrically accurate as well as interpretable reconstructions using an order of magnitude fewer primitives than state-of-the-art shape abstraction methods.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00322","startPage":"3203","endPage":"3214","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9577055/9577056/09577821.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9577056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Parts: Learning Expressive 3D Shape Abstractions with Invertible Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Geometry","Solid modeling","Computer vision","Three-dimensional displays","Shape","Computational modeling","Neural networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9577821/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2021","displayDocTitle":"Neural Parts: Learning Expressive 3D Shape Abstractions with Invertible Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9577821/","publicationDate":"June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Parts: Learning Expressive 3D Shape Abstractions with Invertible Neural Networks","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"450900d203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.143132S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9577055","isNumber":"9577056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9577055","xplore-issue":"9577056","articleId":"9577821","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":9577822,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangguo Zhang","affiliation":["Beihang University"],"firstName":"Xiangguo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37089013210"},{"name":"Haotong Qin","affiliation":["Beihang University"],"firstName":"Haotong","lastName":"Qin","id":"37088456681"},{"name":"Yifu Ding","affiliation":["Beihang University"],"firstName":"Yifu","lastName":"Ding","id":"37089012061"},{"name":"Ruihao Gong","affiliation":["SenseTime Research","Shanghai AI Laboratory"],"firstName":"Ruihao","lastName":"Gong","id":"37088220916"},{"name":"Qinghua Yan","affiliation":["Beihang University"],"firstName":"Qinghua","lastName":"Yan","id":"37089012454"},{"name":"Renshuai Tao","affiliation":["Beihang University"],"firstName":"Renshuai","lastName":"Tao","id":"37087014756"},{"name":"Yuhang Li","affiliation":["Yale University"],"firstName":"Yuhang","lastName":"Li","id":"37089013447"},{"name":"Fengwei Yu","affiliation":["SenseTime Research","Shanghai AI Laboratory"],"firstName":"Fengwei","lastName":"Yu","id":"37088216451"},{"name":"Xianglong Liu","affiliation":["Beihang University"],"firstName":"Xianglong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37539073000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4509-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4510-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-7075"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"9577822","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":11},"abstract":"Quantization has emerged as one of the most prevalent approaches to compress and accelerate neural networks. Recently, data-free quantization has been widely studied as a practical and promising solution. It synthesizes data for calibrating the quantized model according to the batch normalization (BN) statistics of FP32 ones and significantly relieves the heavy dependency on real training data in traditional quantization methods. Unfortunately, we find that in practice, the synthetic data identically constrained by BN statistics suffers serious homogenization at both distribution level and sample level and further causes a significant performance drop of the quantized model. We propose Diverse Sample Generation (DSG) scheme to mitigate the adverse effects caused by homogenization. Specifically, we slack the alignment of feature statistics in the BN layer to relax the constraint at the distribution level and design a layerwise enhancement to reinforce specific layers for different data samples. Our DSG scheme is versatile and even able to be applied to the state-of-the-art post-training quantization method like AdaRound. We evaluate the DSG scheme on the large-scale image classification task and consistently obtain significant improvements over various network architectures and quantization methods, especially when quantized to lower bits (e.g., up to 22% improvement on W4A4). Moreover, benefiting from the enhanced diversity, models calibrated with synthetic data perform close to those calibrated with real data and even outperform them on W4A4.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer vision","Quantization (signal)","Neural networks","Training data","Network architecture","Data models","Pattern recognition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.01540","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9577055/9577056/09577822.pdf","startPage":"15653","endPage":"15662","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9577056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.01540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diversifying Sample Generation for Accurate Data-Free Quantization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9577822","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Diversifying Sample Generation for Accurate Data-Free Quantization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9577822/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9577822/","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010450","fundingName":"Nova"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diversifying Sample Generation for Accurate Data-Free Quantization","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"450900p5653.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095009S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9577055","isNumber":"9577056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9577055","xplore-issue":"9577056","articleId":"9577822","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9577848,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaoyuan Yin","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University"],"firstName":"Zhaoyuan","lastName":"Yin","id":"37089013035"},{"name":"Jia Zheng","affiliation":["KooLab, Manycore"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37087013154"},{"name":"Weixin Luo","affiliation":["Meituan Group"],"firstName":"Weixin","lastName":"Luo","id":"37086196510"},{"name":"Shenhan Qian","affiliation":["ShanghaiTech University"],"firstName":"Shenhan","lastName":"Qian","id":"37089012702"},{"name":"Hanling Zhang","affiliation":["School of Design, Hunan University"],"firstName":"Hanling","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37293129700"},{"name":"Shenghua Gao","affiliation":["ShanghaiTech University","Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Vision and Imaging"],"firstName":"Shenghua","lastName":"Gao","id":"37403624600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4509-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4510-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-7075"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"9577848","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":15},"abstract":"This paper proposes a framework for the interactive video object segmentation (VOS) in the wild where users can choose some frames for annotations iteratively. Then, based on the user annotations, a segmentation algorithm refines the masks. The previous interactive VOS paradigm selects the frame with some worst evaluation metric, and the ground truth is required for calculating the evaluation metric, which is impractical in the testing phase. In contrast, in this paper, we advocate that the frame with the worst evaluation metric may not be exactly the most valuable frame that leads to the most performance improvement across the video. Thus, we formulate the frame selection problem in the interactive VOS as a Markov Decision Process, where an agent is learned to recommend the frame under a deep reinforcement learning framework. The learned agent can automatically determine the most valuable frame, making the interactive setting more practical in the wild.

To date, deep learning based methods have been popularly used to handle this task. State-of-the-art methods directly concatenate the raw attributes of 3D inputs, namely coordinates and normal vectors of mesh cells, to train a single-stream network for fully-automated tooth segmentation. This, however, has the drawback of ignoring the different geometric meanings provided by those raw attributes. This issue might possibly confuse the network in learning discriminative geometric features and result in many isolated false predictions on the dental model. Against this issue, we propose a two-stream graph convolutional network (TSGCNet) to learn multi-view geometric information from different geometric attributes. Our TSGCNet adopts two graph-learning streams, designed in an input-aware fashion, to extract more discriminative high-level geometric representations from coordinates and normal vectors, respectively. These feature representations learned from the designed two different streams are further fused to integrate the multi-view complementary information for the cell-wise dense prediction task.

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Self-Supervised Semantic Alignment Graph Convolution Network (SelfSAGCN), which consists of two crux techniques: Identity Aggregation and Semantic Alignment, to overcome these weaknesses. The behind basic idea is the node features in the same class but learned from semantic and graph structural aspects respectively, are expected to be mapped nearby. Specifically, the Identity Aggregation is applied to extract semantic features from labeled nodes, the Semantic Alignment is utilized to align node features obtained from different aspects using the class central similarity. In this way, the over-smoothing phenomenon is alleviated, while the similarities between the unlabeled features and labeled ones from the same class are enhanced. Experimental results on five popular datasets show that the proposed SelfSAGCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various classification tasks.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.01650","pdfPath":"/iel7/9577055/9577056/09577947.pdf","startPage":"16770","endPage":"16779","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.01650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9577056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-SAGCN: Self-Supervised Semantic Alignment for Graph Convolution Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9577947/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2021","displayDocTitle":"Self-SAGCN: Self-Supervised Semantic Alignment for Graph Convolution Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","publicationDate":"June 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9577947/","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100012470","fundingName":"CERN"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-SAGCN: Self-Supervised Semantic Alignment for Graph Convolution Network","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"450900q6770.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095297S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9577055","isNumber":"9577056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9577055","xplore-issue":"9577056","articleId":"9577947","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":9577969,"authors":[{"name":"Shao-Ping Lu","affiliation":["TKLNDST, CS, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Shao-Ping","lastName":"Lu","id":"37076301300"},{"name":"Rong Wang","affiliation":["TKLNDST, CS, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088578377"},{"name":"Tao Zhong","affiliation":["TKLNDST, CS, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37089012543"},{"name":"Paul L.

Sharing all parameters of our single ISN architecture enables us to efficiently generate both the container image and the revealed hidden image(s) with high quality. Moreover, in our architecture the capacity of image steganography is significantly improved by naturally increasing the number of channels of the hidden image branch.

However, popular deep learning methods and explainability techniques (explainers) based on pixel-wise processing disregard biological entities\u2019 notion, thus complicating comprehension by pathologists. In this work, we address this by adopting biological entity-based graph processing and graph explainers enabling explanations accessible to pathologists. In this context, a major challenge becomes to discern meaningful explainers, particularly in a standardized and quantifiable fashion. To this end, we propose herein a set of novel quantitative metrics based on statistics of class separability using pathologically measurable concepts to characterize graph explainers. We employ the proposed metrics to evaluate three types of graph explainers, namely the layer-wise relevance propagation, gradient-based saliency, and graph pruning approaches, to explain Cell-Graph representations for Breast Cancer Subtyping. The proposed metrics are also applicable in other domains by using domain-specific intuitive concepts. We validate the qualitative and quantitative findings on the BRACS dataset, a large cohort of breast cancer RoIs, by expert pathologists.

Several techniques were proposed to improve the accuracy of BNNs. One of the approaches is to balance the distribution of binary activations so that the amount of information in the binary activations becomes maximum. Based on extensive analysis, in stark contrast to previous work, we argue that unbalanced activation distribution can actually improve the accuracy of BNNs. We also show that adjusting the threshold values of binary activation functions results in the unbalanced distribution of the binary activation, which increases the accuracy of BNN models. Experimental results show that the accuracy of previous BNN models (e.g. XNOR-Net and Bi-Real-Net) can be improved by simply shifting the threshold values of binary activation functions without requiring any other modification.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00777","startPage":"7858","endPage":"7867","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9577056","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9577055/9577056/09577986.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Accuracy of Binary Neural Networks using Unbalanced Activation Distribution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9577986/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improving Accuracy of Binary Neural Networks using Unbalanced Activation Distribution","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9577986/","publicationDate":"June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004358","fundingName":"Samsung"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Accuracy of Binary Neural Networks using Unbalanced Activation Distribution","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"450900h858.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092585S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9577055","isNumber":"9577056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9577055","xplore-issue":"9577056","articleId":"9577986","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9578050,"authors":[{"name":"Zi Wang","affiliation":["The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Zi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086365134"},{"name":"Chengcheng Li","affiliation":["The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Chengcheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37086365079"},{"name":"Xiangyang Wang","affiliation":["Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiangyang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086670657"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4509-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4510-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-7075"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"9578050","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":24},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9578050","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer vision","Image synthesis","Redundancy","Object detection","Computer architecture","Network architecture","Pattern recognition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.01467","pdfPath":"/iel7/9577055/9577056/09578050.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","startPage":"14908","endPage":"14917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9577056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.01467","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convolutional Neural Network Pruning with Structural Redundancy Reduction","abstract":"Convolutional neural network (CNN) pruning has become one of the most successful network compression approaches in recent years.

We first statistically model the network pruning problem in a redundancy reduction perspective and find that pruning in the layer(s) with the most structural redundancy outperforms pruning the least important filters across all layers. Based on this finding, we then propose a network pruning approach that identifies structural redundancy of a CNN and prunes filters in the selected layer(s) with the most redundancy.

Objects can be described using a wide variety of attributes which portray their visual appearance (color, texture), geometry (shape, size, posture), and other intrinsic properties (state, action). Existing work is mostly limited to study of attribute prediction in specific domains. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale in-the-wild visual attribute prediction dataset consisting of over 927K attribute annotations for over 260K object instances. Formally, object attribute prediction is a multi-label classification problem where all attributes that apply to an object must be predicted. Our dataset poses significant challenges to existing methods due to large number of attributes, label sparsity, data imbalance, and object occlusion. To this end, we propose several techniques that systematically tackle these challenges, including a base model that utilizes both low- and high-level CNN features with multi-hop attention, reweighting and resampling techniques, a novel negative label expansion scheme, and a novel supervised attribute-aware contrastive learning algorithm. Using these techniques, we achieve near 3.7 mAP and 5.7 overall F1 points improvement over the current state of the art.

While re-balanced data sampling can improve the performance on tail classes, it may also hurt the performance on head classes in training due to label co-occurrence. In this paper, we propose a new approach to train on both uniform and re-balanced samplings in a collaborative way, resulting in performance improvement on both head and tail classes. More specifically, we design a visual recognition network with two branches: one takes the uniform sampling as input while the other takes the re-balanced sampling as the input. For each branch, we conduct visual recognition using a binary-cross-entropy-based classification loss with learnable logit compensation. We further define a new cross-branch loss to enforce the consistency when the same input image goes through the two branches. We conduct extensive experiments on VOC-LT and COCO-LT datasets. The results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on long-tailed multi-label visual recognition.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9577056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.01484","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9577055/9577056/09578135.pdf","startPage":"15084","endPage":"15093","doi":"10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.01484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Long-Tailed Multi-Label Visual Recognition by Collaborative Training on Uniform and Re-balanced Samplings","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2021","displayDocTitle":"Long-Tailed Multi-Label Visual Recognition by Collaborative Training on Uniform and Re-balanced Samplings","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9578135/","publicationDate":"June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9578135/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long-Tailed Multi-Label Visual Recognition by Collaborative Training on Uniform and Re-balanced Samplings","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"450900p5084.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114687S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9577055","isNumber":"9577056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9577055","xplore-issue":"9577056","articleId":"9578135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9578152,"authors":[{"name":"Dilin Wang","affiliation":["Facebook"],"firstName":"Dilin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37087133525"},{"name":"Meng Li","affiliation":["Facebook"],"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Li","id":"37089018611"},{"name":"Chengyue Gong","affiliation":["University of Texas, Austin"],"firstName":"Chengyue","lastName":"Gong","id":"37087133156"},{"name":"Vikas Chandra","affiliation":["Facebook"],"firstName":"Vikas","lastName":"Chandra","id":"37337598600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4509-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4510-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-7075"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"9578152","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":12},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Computer vision","Codes","Computer architecture","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","object tracking","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling strategy","extra re-training","discovered model family","AttentiveNAS models","SOTA models","BigNAS","ImageNet accuracy","training code","pretrained models","improving neural architecture search","state-of-the-art models","model training","searching process","remarkable search efficiency","two-stage NAS","search space","final searched models","uniform sampling","model performance Pareto front","search process","model accuracy"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9578152","abstract":"Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown great promise in designing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models that are both accurate and efficient. Recently, two-stage NAS, e.g. BigNAS, decouples the model training and searching process and achieves remarkable search efficiency and accuracy. Two-stage NAS requires sampling from the search space during training, which directly impacts the accuracy of the final searched models. While uniform sampling has been widely used for its simplicity, it is agnostic of the model performance Pareto front, which is the main focus in the search process, and thus, misses opportunities to further improve the model accuracy. In this work, we propose AttentiveNAS that focuses on improving the sampling strategy to achieve better performance Pareto. We also propose algorithms to efficiently and effectively identify the networks on the Pareto during training. Without extra re-training or post-processing, we can simultaneously obtain a large number of networks across a wide range of FLOPs. Our discovered model family, AttentiveNAS models, achieves top-1 accuracy from 77.3% to 80.7% on ImageNet, and outperforms SOTA models, including BigNAS, Once-for-All networks and FBNetV3.

Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed regularization scheme 1) improves the generalization performance and stabilizes the learning dynamics of GAN models under limited training data, and 2) complements the recent data augmentation methods. These properties facilitate training GAN models to achieve state-of-theart performance when only limited training data of the ImageNet benchmark is available.

Two key issues are discovered: (1) Self LC is the most appealing as it exploits its own knowledge and requires no extra models. However, how to automatically decide the trust degree of a learner as training goes is not well answered in the literature? (2) Some methods penalise while the others reward low-entropy predictions, prompting us to ask which one is better?To resolve the first issue, taking two well-accepted propositions\u2013deep neural networks learn meaningful patterns before fitting noise [3] and minimum entropy regularisation principle [10]\u2013we propose a novel end-to-end method named ProSelfLC, which is designed according to learning time and entropy. Specifically, given a data point, we progressively increase trust in its predicted label distribution versus its annotated one if a model has been trained for enough time and the prediction is of low entropy (high confidence). For the second issue, according to ProSelfLC, we empirically prove that it is better to redefine a meaningful low-entropy status and optimise the learner toward it. This serves as a defence of entropy minimisation.We demonstrate the effectiveness of ProSelfLC through extensive experiments in both clean and noisy settings.

The challenge for event signal processing is that they are asynchronously generated, and do not carry absolute intensity but only binary signs informing temporal variations. To study event signal formation and degradation, we implement a display-camera system which enables multi-resolution event recording. We further propose Event- Zoom, a deep neural framework with a backbone architecture of 3D U-Net. EventZoom is trained in a noise-to-noise fashion where the two ends of the network are unfiltered noisy events, enforcing noise-free event restoration. For resolution enhancement, EventZoom incorporates an event-to- image module supervised by high resolution images. Our results showed that EventZoom achieves at least 40 \u00d7 temporal efficiency compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) event denoisers. Additionally, we demonstrate that EventZoom enables performance improvements on applications including event-based visual object tracking and image reconstruction.

However, current methods select each operation independently without considering previous layers. Besides, the historical information obtained with huge computation costs is usually used only once and then discarded. In this paper, we introduce a sampling strategy based on Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) with the search space modeled as a Monte Carlo tree (MCT), which captures the dependency among layers. Furthermore, intermediate results are stored in the MCT for future decisions and a better exploration-exploitation balance. Concretely, MCT is updated using the training loss as a reward to the architecture performance; for accurately evaluating the numerous nodes, we propose node communication and hierarchical node selection methods in the training and search stages, respectively, making better uses of the operation rewards and hierarchical information. Moreover, for a fair comparison of different NAS methods, we construct an open-source NAS benchmark of a macro search space evaluated on CIFAR-10, namely NAS-Bench-Macro. Extensive experiments on NAS-Bench-Macro and ImageNet demonstrate that our method significantly improves search efficiency and performance. For example, by only searching 20 architectures, our obtained architecture achieves 78.0% top-1 accuracy with 442M FLOPs on ImageNet.

As they generalize the operations of classical CNNs on grids to arbitrary topologies, GNNs also bring much of the implementation challenges of their Euclidean counterparts. Model size, memory footprint, and energy consumption are common concerns for many real-world applications. Network binarization allocates a single bit to parameters and activations, thus dramatically reducing the memory requirements (up to 32x compared to single-precision floating-point numbers) and maximizing the benefits of fast SIMD instructions on modern hardware for measurable speedups. However, in spite of the large body of work on binarization for classical CNNs, this area remains largely unexplored in geometric deep learning. In this paper, we present and evaluate different strategies for the binarization of graph neural networks. We show that through careful design of the models, and control of the training process, binary graph neural networks can be trained at only a moderate cost in accuracy on challenging benchmarks. In particular, we present the first dynamic graph neural network in Hamming space, able to leverage efficient k-NN search on binary vectors to speed-up the construction of the dynamic graph. We further verify that the binary models offer significant savings on embedded devices.

Different from the conventional digital cameras that compact the photoelectric information within the exposure interval into a single snapshot, the spike camera produces a continuous spike stream to record the dynamic light intensity variation process. For spike cameras, image reconstruction remains an important and challenging issue. To this end, this paper develops a spike-to-image neural network (Spk2ImgNet) to reconstruct the dynamic scene from the continuous spike stream. In particular, to handle the challenges brought by both noise and high-speed motion, we propose a hierarchical architecture to exploit the temporal correlation of the spike stream progressively. Firstly, a spatially adaptive light inference subnet is proposed to exploit the local temporal correlation, producing basic light intensity estimates of different moments. Then, a pyramid deformable alignment is utilized to align the intermediate features such that the feature fusion module can exploit the long-term temporal correlation, while avoiding undesired motion blur. In addition, to train the network, we simulate the working mechanism of spike camera to generate a large-scale spike dataset composed of spike streams and corresponding ground truth images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network evidently outperforms the state-of-the-art spike camera reconstruction methods.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9577056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.01182","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9577055/9577056/09578509.pdf","startPage":"11991","endPage":"12000","doi":"10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.01182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spk2ImgNet: Learning to Reconstruct Dynamic Scene from Continuous Spike Stream","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2021","displayDocTitle":"Spk2ImgNet: Learning to Reconstruct Dynamic Scene from Continuous Spike Stream","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9578509/","publicationDate":"June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9578509/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spk2ImgNet: Learning to Reconstruct Dynamic Scene from Continuous Spike Stream","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"450900l1991.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.14695S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9577055","isNumber":"9577056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9577055","xplore-issue":"9577056","articleId":"9578509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9578511,"authors":[{"name":"Ji Liu","affiliation":["Xilinx Inc., Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Liu","id":"37089012232"},{"name":"Dong Li","affiliation":["Xilinx Inc., Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Li","id":"37088455020"},{"name":"Rongzhang Zheng","affiliation":["Xilinx Inc., Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rongzhang","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37089015638"},{"name":"Lu Tian","affiliation":["Xilinx Inc., Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Tian","id":"37086863174"},{"name":"Yi Shan","affiliation":["Xilinx Inc., Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Shan","id":"37085710681"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4509-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4510-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-7075"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"9578511","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9578511","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Location awareness","Computer vision","Three-dimensional displays","Costs","Object detection","Pattern recognition","Classification algorithms"]}],"abstract":"Modern object detection approaches cast detecting objects as optimizing two subtasks of classification and localization simultaneously. Existing methods often learn the classification task by optimizing each proposal separately and neglect the relationship among different proposals. Such detection paradigm also encounters the mismatch between classification and localization due to the inherent discrepancy of their optimization targets. In this work, we propose a ranking-based optimization algorithm for harmoniously learning to rank and localize proposals in lieu of the classification task. To this end, we comprehensively investigate three types of ranking constraints, i.e., global ranking, class-specific ranking and IoU-guided ranking losses. The global ranking loss encourages foreground samples to rank higher than background. The class-specific ranking loss ensures that positive samples rank higher than negative ones for each specific class. The IoU-guided ranking loss aims to align each pair of confidence scores with the associated pair of IoU overlap between two positive samples of a specific class. Our ranking constraints can sufficiently explore the relationships between samples from three different perspectives. They are easy-to-implement, compatible with mainstream detection frameworks and computation-free for inference. Experiments demonstrate that our RankDetNet consistently surpasses prior anchor-based and anchor-free baselines, e.g., improving RetinaNet baseline by 2.5% AP on the COCO test-dev set without bells and whistles. We also apply the proposed ranking constraints for 3D object detection and achieve improved performance, which further validates the superiority and generality of our method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9577056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00033","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9577055/9577056/09578511.pdf","startPage":"264","endPage":"273","doi":"10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00033","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RankDetNet: Delving into Ranking Constraints for Object Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2021","displayDocTitle":"RankDetNet: Delving into Ranking Constraints for Object Detection","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9578511/","publicationDate":"June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9578511/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RankDetNet: Delving into Ranking Constraints for Object Detection","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"450900a264.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.190605S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9577055","isNumber":"9577056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9577055","xplore-issue":"9577056","articleId":"9578511","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9578530,"authors":[{"name":"Tianjiao Li","affiliation":["Information Systems Technology and Design, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"firstName":"Tianjiao","lastName":"Li","id":"37088659442"},{"name":"Jun Liu","affiliation":["Information Systems Technology and Design, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37088558209"},{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37714605300"},{"name":"Yun Ni","affiliation":["Information Systems Technology and Design, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Ni","id":"37089017977"},{"name":"Wenqian Wang","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong"],"firstName":"Wenqian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089015687"},{"name":"Zhiheng Li","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong"],"firstName":"Zhiheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37088660793"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4509-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4510-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-7075"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"9578530","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer vision","Pose estimation","Video sequences","Lighting","Benchmark testing","Distortion","Unmanned aerial vehicles"]}],"abstract":"Human behavior understanding with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is of great significance for a wide range of applications, which simultaneously brings an urgent demand of large, challenging, and comprehensive benchmarks for the development and evaluation of UAV-based models. However, existing benchmarks have limitations in terms of the amount of captured data, types of data modalities, categories of provided tasks, and diversities of subjects and environments. Here we propose a new benchmark - UAV-Human - for human behavior understanding with UAVs, which contains 67,428 multi-modal video sequences and 119 subjects for action recognition, 22,476 frames for pose estimation, 41,290 frames and 1,144 identities for person re-identification, and 22,263 frames for attribute recognition. Our dataset was collected by a flying UAV in multiple urban and rural districts in both daytime and night-time over three months, hence covering extensive diversities w.r.t subjects, backgrounds, illuminations, weathers, occlusions, camera motions, and UAV flying attitudes. Such a comprehensive and challenging benchmark shall be able to promote the research of UAV-based human behavior understanding, including action recognition, pose estimation, re-identification, and attribute recognition. Furthermore, we propose a fisheye-based action recognition method that mitigates the distortions in fisheye videos via learning unbounded transformations guided by flat RGB videos.

Traditional methods like ICP tend to fail without good initialization, insufficient overlap or in the presence of dynamic objects. Modern deep learning based registration approaches present much better results, but suffer from a heavy runtime. We overcome these drawbacks by introducing StickyPillars, a fast, accurate and extremely robust deep middle-end 3D feature matching method on point clouds. It uses graph neural networks and performs context aggregation on sparse 3D key-points with the aid of transformer based multi-head self and cross-attention. The network output is used as the cost for an optimal transport problem whose solution yields the final matching probabilities. The system does not rely on hand crafted feature descriptors or heuristic matching strategies. We present state-of-art art accuracy results on the registration problem demonstrated on the KITTI dataset while being four times faster then leading deep methods. Furthermore, we integrate our matching system into a LiDAR odometry pipeline yielding most accurate results on the KITTI odometry dataset. Finally, we demonstrate robustness on KITTI odometry. Our method remains stable in accuracy where state-of-the-art procedures fail on frame drops and higher speeds.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00038","startPage":"313","endPage":"323","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9577056","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9577055/9577056/09578620.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"StickyPillars: Robust and Efficient Feature Matching on Point Clouds using Graph Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9578620/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"StickyPillars: Robust and Efficient Feature Matching on Point Clouds using Graph Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9578620/","publicationDate":"June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"StickyPillars: Robust and Efficient Feature Matching on Point Clouds using Graph Neural Networks","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"450900a313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112257S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9577055","isNumber":"9577056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9577055","xplore-issue":"9577056","articleId":"9578620","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":9578624,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Zhou","affiliation":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37089016428"},{"name":"Weizhong Zhang","affiliation":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Weizhong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37089013643"},{"name":"Hang Xu","affiliation":["Huawei Noah\u2019s Ark Lab"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37087233940"},{"name":"Tong Zhang","affiliation":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37087121319"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4509-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4510-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-7075"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"9578624","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9578624","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Weight measurement","Training","Neural networks","Redundancy","Manuals","Tools","Probabilistic logic"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00360","pdfPath":"/iel7/9577055/9577056/09578624.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","startPage":"3598","endPage":"3607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9577056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00360","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective Sparsification of Neural Networks with Global Sparsity Constraint","abstract":"Weight pruning is an effective technique to reduce the model size and inference time for deep neural networks in real-world deployments. However, since magnitudes and relative importance of weights are very different for different layers of a neural network, existing methods rely on either manual tuning or handcrafted heuristic rules to find appropriate pruning rates individually for each layer. This approach generally leads to suboptimal performance. In this paper, by directly working on the probability space, we propose an effective network sparsification method called probabilistic masking (ProbMask), which solves a natural sparsification formulation under global sparsity constraint. The key idea is to use probability as a global criterion for all layers to measure the weight importance. An appealing feature of ProbMask is that the amounts of weight redundancy can be learned automatically via our constraint and thus we avoid the problem of tuning pruning rates individually for different layers in a network. Extensive experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet demonstrate that our method is highly effective, and can outperform previous state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin, especially in the high pruning rate situation. Notably, the gap of Top-1 accuracy between our ProbMask and existing methods can be up to 10%. As a by-product, we show ProbMask is also highly effective in identifying supermasks, which are sub-networks with high performance in a randomly weighted dense neural network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9578624/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9578624/","publicationDate":"June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Effective Sparsification of Neural Networks with Global Sparsity Constraint","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective Sparsification of Neural Networks with Global Sparsity Constraint","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"450900d598.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097788S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9577055","isNumber":"9577056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9577055","xplore-issue":"9577056","articleId":"9578624","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9578657,"authors":[{"name":"Haoang Li","affiliation":["The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Haoang","lastName":"Li","id":"37086937885"},{"name":"Kai Chen","affiliation":["The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086218452"},{"name":"Ji Zhao","affiliation":["TuSimple, China"],"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37963498600"},{"name":"Jiangliu Wang","affiliation":["The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jiangliu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086799602"},{"name":"Pyojin Kim","affiliation":["Sookmyung Women\u2019s University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Pyojin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085573756"},{"name":"Zhe Liu","affiliation":["University of Cambridge, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Zhe","lastName":"Liu","id":"37087246983"},{"name":"Yun-Hui Liu","affiliation":["The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yun-Hui","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279412600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4509-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4510-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-7075"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"9578657","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":21},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9578657","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer vision","Computer network reliability","Neural networks","Parallel processing","Market research","Robustness","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image matching","image reconstruction","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image line","neighboring vectors","correct matches","spatial regularity","smoothness constraint","vector field","Identify Correct 2D-2D Line Correspondences","geometric constraint","structured scenes","parallelism","coplanarity","unstructured scenes","map line"]}],"abstract":"Given a set of putative 2D-2D line correspondences, we aim to identify correct matches. Existing methods exploit the geometric constraints. They are only applicable to structured scenes with orthogonality, parallelism and coplanarity. In contrast, we propose the first approach suitable for both structured and unstructured scenes. Instead of geometric constraint, we leverage the spatial regularity on sphere. Specifically, we propose to map line correspondences into vectors tangent to sphere. We use these vectors to encode both angular and positional variations of image lines, which is more reliable and concise than directly using inclinations, midpoints or endpoints of image lines. Neighboring vectors mapped from correct matches exhibit a spatial regularity called local trend consistency, regardless of the type of scenes. To encode this regularity, we design a neural network and also propose a novel loss function that enforces the smoothness constraint of vector field.

Recent studies have focused on a \"nested dropout\" layer, which is able to order the nodes of a layer by importance during training, thus generating a nested set of subnetworks that are optimal for different configurations of resources. However, the dropout rate is fixed as a hyperparameter over different layers during the whole training process. Therefore, when nodes are removed, the performance decays in a human-specified trajectory rather than in a trajectory learned from data. Another drawback is the generated sub-networks are deterministic networks without well-calibrated uncertainty. To address these two problems, we develop a Bayesian approach to nested neural networks. We propose a variational ordering unit that draws samples for nested dropout at a low cost, from a proposed Downhill distribution, which provides useful gradients to the parameters of nested dropout. Based on this approach, we design a Bayesian nested neural network that learns the order knowledge of the node distributions. In experiments, we show that the proposed approach outperforms the nested network in terms of accuracy, calibration, and out-of-domain detection in classification tasks. It also outperforms the related approach on uncertainty-critical tasks in computer vision.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00242","startPage":"2392","endPage":"2401","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9577056","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9577055/9577056/09578687.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian Nested Neural Networks for Uncertainty Calibration and Adaptive Compression","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9578687/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Bayesian Nested Neural Networks for Uncertainty Calibration and Adaptive Compression","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9578687/","publicationDate":"June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian Nested Neural Networks for Uncertainty Calibration and Adaptive Compression","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"450900c392.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.143475S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9577055","isNumber":"9577056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9577055","xplore-issue":"9577056","articleId":"9578687","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9578706,"authors":[{"name":"Yiding Yang","affiliation":["Stevens Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Yiding","lastName":"Yang","id":"37088455167"},{"name":"Zhou Ren","affiliation":["Wormpex AI Research"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Ren","id":"37087234627"},{"name":"Haoxiang Li","affiliation":["Wormpex AI Research"],"firstName":"Haoxiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37075630500"},{"name":"Chunluan Zhou","affiliation":["Wormpex AI Research"],"firstName":"Chunluan","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086282950"},{"name":"Xinchao Wang","affiliation":["Stevens Institute of Technology","National University of Singapore"],"firstName":"Xinchao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086391860"},{"name":"Gang Hua","affiliation":["Wormpex AI Research"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Hua","id":"37274683000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4509-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4510-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-7075"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"9578706","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":11},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9578706","abstract":"Multi-person pose estimation and tracking serve as crucial steps for video understanding. Most state-of-the-art approaches rely on first estimating poses in each frame and only then implementing data association and refinement. Despite the promising results achieved, such a strategy is inevitably prone to missed detections especially in heavily-cluttered scenes, since this tracking-by-detection paradigm is, by nature, largely dependent on visual evidences that are absent in the case of occlusion. In this paper, we propose a novel online approach to learning the pose dynamics, which are independent of pose detections in current fame, and hence may serve as a robust estimation even in challenging scenarios including occlusion. Specifically, we derive this prediction of dynamics through a graph neural network (GNN) that explicitly accounts for both spatial-temporal and visual information. It takes as input the historical pose tracklets and directly predicts the corresponding poses in the following frame for each tracklet. The predicted poses will then be aggregated with the detected poses, if any, at the same frame so as to produce the final pose, potentially recovering the occluded joints missed by the estimator. Experiments on PoseTrack 2017 and Pose-Track 2018 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves results superior to the state of the art on both human pose estimation and tracking tasks.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00798","startPage":"8070","endPage":"8080","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9577055/9577056/09578706.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9577056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Dynamics via Graph Neural Networks for Human Pose Estimation and Tracking","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Computer vision","Aggregates","Pose estimation","Pipelines","Predictive models","Graph neural networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9578706/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2021","displayDocTitle":"Learning Dynamics via Graph Neural Networks for Human Pose Estimation and Tracking","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9578706/","publicationDate":"June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Dynamics via Graph Neural Networks for Human Pose Estimation and Tracking","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"450900i070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117502S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9577055","isNumber":"9577056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9577055","xplore-issue":"9577056","articleId":"9578706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9578732,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Huang","affiliation":["Apple Inc."],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Huang","id":"37089016734"},{"name":"Shuangfei Zhai","affiliation":["Apple Inc."],"firstName":"Shuangfei","lastName":"Zhai","id":"37088887841"},{"name":"Pengsheng Guo","affiliation":["Apple Inc."],"firstName":"Pengsheng","lastName":"Guo","id":"37086935439"},{"name":"Josh Susskind","affiliation":["Apple Inc."],"firstName":"Josh","lastName":"Susskind","id":"37937119800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4509-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4510-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-7075"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"9578732","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":24},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Computational modeling","Image retrieval","Computer architecture","Object detection","Solids","Pattern recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9578732","abstract":"We study the problem of directly optimizing arbitrary non-differentiable task evaluation metrics such as misclassification rate and recall. Our method, named MetricOpt, operates in a black-box setting where the computational details of the target metric are unknown. We achieve this by learning a differentiable value function, which maps compact task-specific model parameters to metric observations. The learned value function is easily pluggable into existing optimizers like SGD and Adam, and is effective for rapidly finetuning a pre-trained model. This leads to consistent improvements since the value function provides effective metric supervision during finetuning, and helps to correct the potential bias of loss-only supervision. MetricOpt achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of metrics for (image) classification, image retrieval and object detection. Solid benefits are found over competing methods, which often involve complex loss design or adaptation. MetricOpt also generalizes well to new tasks and model architectures.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00024","startPage":"174","endPage":"183","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9577055/9577056/09578732.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9577056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MetricOpt: Learning to Optimize Black-Box Evaluation Metrics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2021","displayDocTitle":"MetricOpt: Learning to Optimize Black-Box Evaluation Metrics","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2021","publicationDate":"June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9578732/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9578732/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MetricOpt: Learning to Optimize Black-Box Evaluation Metrics","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"450900a174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116982S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9577055","isNumber":"9577056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9577055","xplore-issue":"9577056","articleId":"9578732","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9578751,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew Tancik","affiliation":["UC Berkeley"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Tancik","id":"37086030996"},{"name":"Ben Mildenhall","affiliation":["UC Berkeley"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Mildenhall","id":"37086568629"},{"name":"Terrance Wang","affiliation":["UC Berkeley"],"firstName":"Terrance","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089013052"},{"name":"Divi Schmidt","affiliation":["UC Berkeley"],"firstName":"Divi","lastName":"Schmidt","id":"37089015103"},{"name":"Pratul P.

We propose applying standard meta-learning algorithms to learn the initial weight parameters for these fully-connected networks based on the underlying class of signals being represented (e.g., images of faces or 3D models of chairs). Despite requiring only a minor change in implementation, using these learned initial weights enables faster convergence during optimization and can serve as a strong prior over the signal class being modeled, resulting in better generalization when only partial observations of a given signal are available. We explore these benefits across a variety of tasks, including representing 2D images, reconstructing CT scans, and recovering 3D shapes and scenes from 2D image observations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solid modeling","Three-dimensional displays","Limiting","Shape","Trajectory","Pattern recognition","Task analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised tomography","image reconstruction","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fully-connected networks","learned initial weights","signal class","given signal","learned initializations","coordinate-based neural representations","discrete array-based representations","complex low dimensional signals","randomly initialized weights","standard meta-learning algorithms","initial weight parameters"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00287","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9577055/9577056/09578751.pdf","startPage":"2845","endPage":"2854","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9577056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learned Initializations for Optimizing Coordinate-Based Neural Representations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9578751","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learned Initializations for Optimizing Coordinate-Based Neural Representations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9578751/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9578751/","accessionNumber":"21274718","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learned Initializations for Optimizing Coordinate-Based Neural Representations","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"450900c845.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10766S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9577055","isNumber":"9577056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9577055","xplore-issue":"9577056","articleId":"9578751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9578768,"authors":[{"name":"Jianpeng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, China","The University of Adelaide, Australia"],"firstName":"Jianpeng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086429042"},{"name":"Yutong Xie","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, China","The University of Adelaide, Australia"],"firstName":"Yutong","lastName":"Xie","id":"37086426229"},{"name":"Yong Xia","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Xia","id":"37293555400"},{"name":"Chunhua Shen","affiliation":["The University of Adelaide, Australia"],"firstName":"Chunhua","lastName":"Shen","id":"37274255300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4509-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4510-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-7075"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"9578768","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":41},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9578768","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Three-dimensional displays","Head","Annotations","Encoding","Labeling","Task analysis"]}],"abstract":"Due to the intensive cost of labor and expertise in annotating 3D medical images at a voxel level, most benchmark datasets are equipped with the annotations of only one type of organs and/or tumors, resulting in the so-called partially labeling issue. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic on-demand network (DoDNet) that learns to segment multiple organs and tumors on partially labeled datasets. DoD-Net consists of a shared encoder-decoder architecture, a task encoding module, a controller for dynamic filter generation, and a single but dynamic segmentation head. The information of current segmentation task is encoded as a task-aware prior to tell the model what the task is expected to achieve. Different from existing approaches which fix kernels after training, the kernels in dynamic head are generated adaptively by the controller, conditioned on both input image and assigned task. Thus, DoDNet is able to segment multiple organs and tumors, as done by multiple networks or a multi-head network, in a much efficient and flexible manner. We created a large-scale partially labeled dataset called MOTS and demonstrated the superior performance of our DoDNet over other competitors on seven organ and tumor segmentation tasks. We also transferred the weights pre-trained on MOTS to a downstream multi-organ segmentation task and achieved state-of-the-art performance. This study provides a general 3D medical image segmentation model that has been pre-trained on a large-scale partially labeled dataset and can be extended (after fine-tuning) to downstream volumetric medical data segmentation tasks.

Therefore, we propose the first REal-world VIdeo DEhazing (REVIDE) dataset which can be used for the supervised learning of the video dehazing algorithms. By utilizing a well-designed video acquisition system, we can capture paired real-world hazy and haze-free videos that are perfectly aligned by recording the same scene (with or without haze) twice. Considering the challenge of exploiting temporal redundancy among the hazy frames, we also develop a Confidence Guided and Improved Deformable Network (CG-IDN) for video dehazing.

While these deep learning systems are getting closer to practical deployment, the common assumption made about data is that it does not carry any sensitive information. This assumption may not hold for many practical cases, especially in the domain where an individual\u2019s personal information is involved, like healthcare and facial recognition systems. We posit that selectively removing features in this latent space can protect the sensitive information and provide better privacy-utility trade-off. Consequently, we propose DISCO which learns a dynamic and data driven pruning filter to selectively obfuscate sensitive information in the feature space. We propose diverse attack schemes for sensitive inputs & attributes and demonstrate the effectiveness of DISCO against state-of-the-art methods through quantitative and qualitative evaluation.

Our main aim is to design a distributed resource allocation mechanism that encourages each participating WBAN user to participate and upload each other\u2019s data collaboratively. We propose an auction-based mechanism that optimizes data uploading for all participating users and the corresponding reimbursement. In the proposed auction mechanism, each user acts as both auctioneer and bidder. Fist, the auctioneer initiates the auction by announcing the amount of resource it wants to share and its price and each bidder submits their bid to each auctioneer based on its demand. We further propose a distributed algorithm for the auction mechanism that jointly solves both the auctioneers\u2019 and the bidders\u2019 optimization problems and determines the optimal amount of resource users should reserve for their own and the portion they should share. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed distributed algorithm converges to the solution that maximizes the aggregated benefit of the users. Finally, the simulation results exhibit that the proposed algorithm always improves WBAN user\u2019s individual performance together with overall BBN performance.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3121027","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09578984.pdf","startPage":"379","endPage":"388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3121027","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Resource Allocation for Collaborative Data Uploading in Body-to-Body Networks","volume":"70","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9578984/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9578984/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Resource Allocation for Collaborative Data Uploading in Body-to-Body Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-misra-3121027-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076029S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9578984","onlineDate":"18 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9578987,"authors":[{"name":"Elad Domanovitz","affiliation":["University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Elad Domanovitz (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc.

While the capacity of a channel that introduces only bursts of erasures has been known for more than fifteen years, only recently, the capacity of a channel with either one burst of erasures or multiple arbitrary erasures in any fixed-sized sliding window has been established. However, explicit codes shown to achieve this capacity for any admissible set of parameters require a large field size that scales exponentially with the delay. Recently, it has been shown that there exist codes that achieve the capacity with field size which scales quadratically with the delay. However, explicit constructions were shown only to specific combinations of parameters. This work describes an explicit rate-optimal construction for all admissible channel and delay parameters over a field size that scales quadratically with the delay.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2021.3121101","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"47","endPage":"65","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3121101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9660615","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/9660615/09578987.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Codes","Delays","Forward error correction","Decoding","Streaming media","Generators","Windows"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Streaming codes","delays","forward error correction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Explicit Rate-Optimal Streaming Code for Channels With Burst and Arbitrary Erasures","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9578987/","volume":"68","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9578987/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Explicit Rate-Optimal Streaming Code for Channels With Burst and Arbitrary Erasures","sourcePdf":"tit-domanovitz-3121101-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131537S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9660615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9660615","articleId":"9578987","onlineDate":"18 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":9579003,"authors":[{"name":"Pavlos S.

To this end, in this second part we introduce and optimize a novel communication protocol for WFL networks, that is based on non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA).

Moreover, two different detection schemes for the mitigation of inter-user interference in NOMA are considered and evaluated, which correspond to fixed and variable decoding order during the successive interference cancellation process. Furthermore, the computation and communication resources are jointly optimized for both considered schemes, with the aim to minimize the total delay during a WFL communication round. Finally, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of CT-NOMA in terms of delay reduction, compared to the considered benchmark that is based on time-division multiple access.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9674048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3121067","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9674048/09579003.pdf","startPage":"8","endPage":"12","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3121067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Federated Learning (WFL) for 6G Networks\u2014Part II: The Compute-Then-Transmit NOMA Paradigm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Federated Learning (WFL) for 6G Networks\u2014Part II: The Compute-Then-Transmit NOMA Paradigm","volume":"26","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9579003/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9579003/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme","grantNumber":"833955"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Federated Learning (WFL) for 6G Networks\u2014Part II: The Compute-Then-Transmit NOMA Paradigm","sourcePdf":"lcomm-karagiannidis-3121067-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107402S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9674048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9674048","articleId":"9579003","onlineDate":"18 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","relatedContent":{"multipart":["10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3121071"]},"publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9579005,"authors":[{"name":"Hongyan Wang","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9579005/wang-3121148-small.gif","p":["Hongyan Wang (Student Member, IEEE) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in signal and information processing from the Guangling College, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China, in 2013 and 2016, respectively.

A high-resolution (HR) image reconstruction module is indispensable for video analytics chips or devices at the edge. This paper proposes a low-cost and learning-based interpolation method for HR image reconstruction. The proposed method generates reconstructed pixels by processing reference pixels with optimal weights, which are pre-trained by solving the minimum mean square error problem for real images. To reduce the number of computation units and the usage of learned weights, a cross-directional interpolation architecture, which includes a vertical kernel and a horizontal kernel, is adopted. Moreover, a one-dimensional feature discriminator is proposed to improve the quality of up-scaled images efficiently. The main benefit of the proposed method is that it requires a small number of computation units but can still produce high-quality images. The hardware architecture of the proposed method was implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) by using Xilinx UltraScale+ ZCU102 and an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) by using TSMC\u2019s 0.13-\n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mu \\text{m}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n technology. On the ASIC, the proposed hardware required only approximately 60K gate counts and 50 KBytes of memory. The experimental results indicate that the average peak signal-to-noise ratio of the up-scaled images reached 35.92 dB for the Set-5 dataset. The throughput of the proposed hardware was at least 1000 Mpixels/s on the FPGA and 1200 Mpixels/s on the ASIC, which indicates that the proposed hardware can handle a target resolution higher than 4K in real time.","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2021.3121070","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503868/9647029/09579021.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","startPage":"677","endPage":"689","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2021.3121070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9647029","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9579021/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","displayDocTitle":"A Low-Cost Hardware Design of Learning-Based One-Dimensional Interpolation for Real-Time Video Applications at the Edge","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9579021/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology at Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 108-2622-8-006-003-TA"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100005144","fundingName":"Qualcomm through the Taiwan University Research Collaboration Project"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-Cost Hardware Design of Learning-Based One-Dimensional Interpolation for Real-Time Video Applications at the Edge","sourcePdf":"jetcas-chen-3121070-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071285S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"9647029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","xplore-issue":"9647029","articleId":"9579021","onlineDate":"18 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9579394,"authors":[{"name":"Shuaiqi Shen","affiliation":["University of Nebraska, Lincoln"],"bio":{"p":["Shuaiqi Shen [stm'21] (sshen@huskers.unl.edu) received his B.Sc. degree in electronic and information engineering from Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2016.

However, the increasing integration of the 6G network with the physical world leads to a plethora of new scenarios that bring new challenges to 6G, especially from the security and energy aspects. In 5G networks, security solutions across all devices and base stations are configured with universal settings for certain types of attacks. This one-size-fit-all strategy no longer suits 6G security due to the higher diversity in device capabilities, service features, energy conditions, attack vulnerabilities, and other time-varying attributes. Since each scenario may have unique security requirements and energy availability, the selection and configuration of security strategies need to be optimized for 6G networks in an adaptive and dynamic manner. In this article, we explore 6G security from an energy efficiency perspective by balancing the tradeoff between security and energy consumption in various scenarios. Specifically, we first investigate the AI-empowered 6G network architecture with promising applications and visions. Then we identify the challenges for adaptive and dynamic security optimization in 6G from the aspects of heterogeneity, dynamics, and modeling complexity. To balance security-energy trade-off, we propose an optimization framework that provides customized recommendations of security strategy to different user devices and base stations.

With the agility and mobility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), RIS can be mounted on UAVs to enable three-dimensional signal reflection. Compared to the conventional terrestrial RIS (TRIS), the aerial RIS (ARIS) enjoys higher deployment flexibility, reliable air-to-ground links, and panoramic full-angle reflection. However, due to UAV's limited payload and battery capacity, it is difficult for a UAV to carry a RIS with a large number of reflecting elements. Thus, the scalability of the aperture gain could not be guaranteed. In practice, multiple UAVs can form a UAV swarm to enable the ARIS cooperatively. In this article, we first present an overview of the UAV swarm-en-abled ARIS (SARIS), including its motivations and competitive advantages compared to TRIS and ARIS, as well as its new transformative applications in wireless networks. We then address the critical challenges of designing the SARIS by focusing on the beamforming design, SARIS channel estimation, and SARIS's deployment and movement. Next, the potential performance enhancement of SARIS is showcased and discussed with preliminary numerical results.

AR/VR devices use an array of sensors, including multiple cameras, to understand their surroundings and provide the user with an immersive experience. To deliver the functionality and performance, AR/VR devices rely on state-of-the-art algorithms including Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). These algorithms must operate in real time, and it presents a computational challenge for a mobile system. The emergence of on-sensor compute provides a possible solution to increase the processing capabilities of an AR/VR platform. In this work, we explore how to optimally map DNN models on an AR/VR compute platform that consists of an on-sensor processor and an edge processor to minimize energy and latency. We explore properties of popular DNN models, and the ideal network split locations, processor sizes, caching strategies, and the interactions between these design choices using a new Distributed Algorithm Simulator (DAS). Based on this study, we develop the basic principles on network split, parameter caching, and two-processor balancing to achieve near-optimal system designs. We show the addition of on-sensor processing to the existing Quest 2 VR platform can reduce MobileNetV3 inference energy by 64.6%. Finally, we demonstrate in a representative AR/VR platform how the minimum-energy configuration changes under the practical design constraints of memory size and silicon area, as well as the impact of future memory technologies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9579429/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","volume":"11","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9579429/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Near-Sensor Distributed DNN Processing for Augmented and Virtual Reality","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100005801","fundingName":"Facebook"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-Sensor Distributed DNN Processing for Augmented and Virtual Reality","sourcePdf":"jetcas-pinkham-3121259-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091492S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"9647029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","xplore-issue":"9647029","articleId":"9579429","onlineDate":"18 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9579439,"authors":[{"name":"Refat Mohammed Abdullah Eshaq","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China","Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Intelligent Mining Equipment, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9579439/eshaq-3121270-small.gif","p":["Refat Mohammed Abdullah Eshaq was born in June 1993.

The contents of fly ash and volatile matter in low-quality coal are extremely harmful to the environment. As a result, there is still much to be explored regarding known hazards and harms to the natural environment of the Earth. For the detection of high-quality coal, we propose a new method of distinguishing coal quality in terms of different \u201ccoal types\u201d (i.e., anthracite, bituminous coal, subbituminous coal and lignite) and efficiently separating gangue and rock from the production lines of coal preparation plants (CPPs) by exploiting infrared machine vision and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for deep learning, which can make coal use less harmful to humans and nature and/or more useful for general welfare. In this article, we conducted two experiments. First experiment is to study the reactions of coal types, gangue and rock with infrared radiation at temperatures of 50\u00b0C, 70\u00b0C, 90\u00b0C, 110\u00b0C, and 150\u00b0C. Second experiment, several common CNN models (i.e., AlexNet, DarkNet-53, GoogLeNet, NasNet_Mobileb, ResNet-18, MobileNet-v2, Inception-v3 and DenseNet-201) are trained and tested to classify coal types and distinguish gangue and rock. We achieve a remarkable classification accuracy of 100% in these training and testing processes when employing the ResNet-18 and DenseNet-201 models.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3121270","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09579439.pdf","startPage":"147315","endPage":"147327","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3121270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks and Infrared Thermography to Identify Coal Quality and Gangue","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9579439/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks and Infrared Thermography to Identify Coal Quality and Gangue","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9579439/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51875568"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks and Infrared Thermography to Identify Coal Quality and Gangue","sourcePdf":"access-eshaq-3121270-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095553S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9579439","onlineDate":"18 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9579440,"authors":[{"name":"Saad Kriouile","affiliation":["Laboratoire des Signaux et Syst\u00e8mes, CentraleSupelec, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"bio":{"p":["Saad Kriouile received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in telecommunications from CentraleSupelec, Gif-sur-Yvette, France, in 2017 and 2021, respectively.

Finding the optimal scheduling scheme, in this case, is known to be challenging. Accordingly, the Whittle\u2019s index policy was proposed in the literature as a low-complexity heuristic to the problem. Although simple to implement, characterizing this policy\u2019s performance is recognized to be a notoriously tricky task. In the sequel, we provide a new mathematical approach to establish its optimality in the many-users regime for specific network settings. Contrary to previous works in the literature that use restrictive mathematical assumptions, which can be challenging to verify, our novel approach is based on intricate techniques and it is free of any strong mathematical assumptions. These findings showcase that the Whittle\u2019s index policy has analytically provable asymptotic optimality for the AoI minimization problem. Finally, we lay out numerical results that corroborate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the policy\u2019s notable performance in the many-users regime.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Decoding","Throughput","Monitoring","Delays","Numerical models","Minimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Age of information (AoI)","markov decision process (MDP)","whittle\u2019s index","global asymptotic optimality"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9660615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3121257","startPage":"572","endPage":"600","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/9660615/09579440.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2021.3121257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Global Optimality of Whittle\u2019s Index Policy for Minimizing the Age of Information","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On the Global Optimality of Whittle\u2019s Index Policy for Minimizing the Age of Information","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","volume":"68","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9579440/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9579440/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Global Optimality of Whittle\u2019s Index Policy for Minimizing the Age of Information","sourcePdf":"tit-assaad-3121257-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156658S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9660615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9660615","articleId":"9579440","onlineDate":"18 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":9579525,"authors":[{"name":"Sanika Mhadgut","affiliation":["MPSTME, NMIMS university, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Sanika","lastName":"Mhadgut","orcid":"0000-0001-8467-6830","id":"37089015214"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8595-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8596-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9579525","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":22},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9579525","abstract":"A new challenge in the facial recognition technology is observed during the COVID-19 pandemic which has created a need for developing alternatives in face recognition algorithms that exist today. During this pandemic, masked faces have made face recognition applications used for security surveillance and attendance systems less effective. A comparative study was conducted on different YOLO models like YOLOv3, Tiny-YOLOv3, Tiny-YOLOv4 to judge their performances for the face detection module. From the study, it is concluded that the YOLOv3 model outperformed the other algorithms. Additionally, the face images captured from cameras were encoded and compared to determine the best face images for the face recognition module. It was identified that YOLOv3 along with face encodings from IP camera images accomplished an overall testing accuracy of 95.83% on masked and unmasked faces. The system introduced a confidence level to further reduce the error while registering the identity of the person.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT51525.2021.9579525","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 12th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9579467/9579470/09579525.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 12th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT51525.2021.9579525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9579470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Masked Face Detection and Recognition System in Real Time using YOLOv3 to combat COVID-19","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["COVID-19","Image coding","Pandemics","Face recognition","Surveillance","Cameras","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Masked Face Detection","Masked Face Recognition","YOLOv3","COVID-19"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9579525/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Masked Face Detection and Recognition System in Real Time using YOLOv3 to combat COVID-19","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9579525/","publicationDate":"6 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Masked Face Detection and Recognition System in Real Time using YOLOv3 to combat COVID-19","confLoc":"Kharagpur, India","sourcePdf":"154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068157S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9579467","isNumber":"9579470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9579467","xplore-issue":"9579470","articleId":"9579525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-07"},{"_id":9579597,"authors":[{"name":"Vandan Shah","affiliation":["MPSTME, NMIMS University, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Vandan","lastName":"Shah","id":"37089016828"},{"name":"Avinash Tandle","affiliation":["MPSTME, NMIMS University, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Avinash","lastName":"Tandle","id":"37085896183"},{"name":"Narendra Sharma","affiliation":["MPSTME, NMIMS University, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Narendra","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37089015828"},{"name":"Vatsal Sheth","affiliation":["MPSTME, NMIMS University, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Vatsal","lastName":"Sheth","id":"37089012286"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8595-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8596-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9579597","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":10},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9579597","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Computational modeling","Neural networks","Feature extraction","Rocks","Data models","Multiple signal classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["music genre classification","feature extraction","acoustic signal processing","music information retrieval","machine learning","classification model","deep learning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT51525.2021.9579597","pdfPath":"/iel7/9579467/9579470/09579597.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 12th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 12th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9579470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT51525.2021.9579597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genre Based Music Classification using Machine Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks","abstract":"In this digital era, as the quantity of music being released on a regular basis continues to grow, Music Information Retrieval (MIR) has become a challenging yet important task.

Pattern recognition and machine learning techniques offer appropriate solutions to deal with such issues. In this paper, we have built various machine learning models for genre classification and trained them on the GTZAN dataset. We have used signal processing to extract informative features from raw audio and have analyzed them for usage. Along with traditional models, we have used ensemble tree models, which result in higher accuracy.

To analyze the characteristic of permanent magnet (PM) motors, the classical optimization method, such as the finite element method (FEM), is intensively used. However, FEM has several time problems that require a longer computational time to evaluate the performance of PM motors. This problem can be overcome by using a genetic algorithm (GA) method combined with a subdomain model (SD), which developed an improved performance of SMPMSM, for instance, total harmonic distortion (THDv) and cogging torque. In this design, a three-phase 12-slot/8-pole PM motor is established with an exact SD model with RM and PaM magnetization patterns. Then, the GA ensemble with SD model to search the optimality of SMPMSM machine design. In the final analysis, the optimal new design of SMPMSM demonstrated by comparing with the initial design that is investigated by FEM. The result of induced back-EMF, cogging torque, total harmonic distortion, and magnetic flux density of optimal design is compared with the initial design to show the advantages of GA optimization method.","doi":"10.1109/INTERMAG42984.2021.9579622","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Magnetic Conference (INTERMAG)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9579468/9579503/09579622.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Magnetic Conference (INTERMAG)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INTERMAG42984.2021.9579622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9579503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Design of SMPMSM Using SD-model based on Genetic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Total harmonic distortion","Forging","Torque","Magnetization","Computational modeling","Optimization methods","Synchronous motors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic Algorithm","analytical SD model","SMPMSM","cogging torque","total harmonic distortions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9579622/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 April 2021","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Design of SMPMSM Using SD-model based on Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9579622/","publicationDate":"April 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"26-30 April 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Design of SMPMSM Using SD-model based on Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"LYON, France","sourcePdf":"2021002824.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084687S","chronDate":"26-30 April 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9579468","isNumber":"9579503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9579468","xplore-issue":"9579503","articleId":"9579622","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9579732,"authors":[{"name":"Vanita Jain","affiliation":["Bharati Vidyapeeth's College of Engineering, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Vanita","lastName":"Jain","id":"37085343219"},{"name":"Apoorv Jain","affiliation":["Bharati Vidyapeeth's College of Engineering, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Apoorv","lastName":"Jain","id":"37089017142"},{"name":"Vinayakk Garg","affiliation":["Bharati Vidyapeeth's College of Engineering, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Vinayakk","lastName":"Garg","id":"37089015578"},{"name":"Chirag Gandhi","affiliation":["Bharati Vidyapeeth's College of Engineering, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Chirag","lastName":"Gandhi","id":"37089016434"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8595-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8596-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9579732","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":12},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Input variables","Oils","Predictive models","Network architecture","Software","Indexes","Stock markets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NIFTY50","long short-term network","technical indicators","global indices","macroeconomic factors"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9579732","abstract":"The Indian stock market is a venue for investors to buy and sell shares and make profits during the trades.

However personalized music recommendation is quotidian, but recommending songs based on emotions is still an uphill battle. Music has greatly influenced the human brain and helps dispense an exhilarating and frivolous state of mind because it helps us work more effectively. Recommending songs based on emotions will comfort the listener by suggesting music in keeping with the listeners' pervading mental and physical state. Hence, Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning technologies made it possible for machines to read and interpret emotions through texts by recognizing patterns and finding correlations. In this paper, various deep learning models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolution Neural network (CNN), CNN-LSTM, and LSTM-CNN Architectures were collated for detecting emotions such as angry, happy, love, and sad, the best model was integrated into the application. To enhance the application, a CNN model was used to detect emotions through facial expressions. The application takes text input from the user or a facial expression input.

The cognitive radio (CR) system is an approach where the unutilized spectrum of primary user (PU) is used by the secondary user (SU). The SU compares PU signal with a threshold to detect the freely available channel. Thus, there is a need for an appropriate threshold. In this paper, we have find an optimum threshold by minimizing the probability of error. We have shown conventional approach where the sensing is done for \u03c4 units and data is transmitted for T-\u03c4 units while in the proposed approach both sensing and data transmission is being done for the entire frame time T using handshaking approach. Further, we have compared their performance parameters. It can be observed that under the condition of optimal threshold, the probability of error in the conventional approach is 0.14953 while it is reduced to 0.01485 in the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT51525.2021.9579851","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 12th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9579467/9579470/09579851.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9579470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT51525.2021.9579851","publicationTitle":"2021 12th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","startPage":"01","endPage":"05","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimizing the Probability of Error in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9579851","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Minimizing the Probability of Error in Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9579851/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9579851/","publicationDate":"6 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimizing the Probability of Error in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Kharagpur, India","sourcePdf":"502.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066478S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9579467","isNumber":"9579470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9579467","xplore-issue":"9579470","articleId":"9579851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":9579855,"authors":[{"name":"Ajinkya Pahinkar","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India"],"firstName":"Ajinkya","lastName":"Pahinkar","id":"37088601830"},{"name":"Prajval Mohan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India"],"firstName":"Prajval","lastName":"Mohan","id":"37088599975"},{"name":"Ankita Mandal","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India"],"firstName":"Ankita","lastName":"Mandal","id":"37089014737"},{"name":"Krishnamoorthy A","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India"],"firstName":"Krishnamoorthy","lastName":"A","id":"37089015488"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8595-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8596-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9579855","dbTime":"1 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Computer vision","Computational modeling","Computer architecture","Tires","Convolutional neural networks","Usability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep Learning","Computer Vision","Faster R-CNN","VGG 16","Tyre Defect Detection","Multi-class Defects","Accuracy"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9579855","abstract":"This paper intends to create a deep-learning architecture for training models over various defective tyre images until it has achieved intelligence to distinctly classify multi-class tyre defects and tell apart various types of defects in tyres using computer vision.

Therefore, in the field of ophthalmology, optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging is widely used in the early diagnosis and treatment of DR. However, it is arduous and time consuming to manually classify and detect DR from retinal OCT image. In this context, this paper proposed a deep convolutional neural network combined with Bidirectional long-short term memory and support vector machine (CNN-BiLSTM+SVM) for automatic DR classification from OCT image. Here, CNN-BiLSTM architecture is used as feature extractor where CNN extracts the local features and BiLSTM learns correlation among the extracted features. SVM is subsequently trained to diagnose diabetic retinopathy using the extracted features. The effectiveness of the proposed model is assessed on blind test dataset of 1000 images (250 per class) labeled into four classes. The proposed model has attained satisfactory results in the classification of diabetic retinopathy, with an accuracy of 99.30%, which also proves its competitiveness in comparison to other existing state-of-the-art.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9579901/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9579901/","publicationDate":"6 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy from OCT Images using Deep Convolutional Neural Network with BiLSTM and SVM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy from OCT Images using Deep Convolutional Neural Network with BiLSTM and SVM","confLoc":"Kharagpur, India","sourcePdf":"636.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043551S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9579467","isNumber":"9579470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9579467","xplore-issue":"9579470","articleId":"9579901","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9579905,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Among all the cancers, skin cancer is often unnoticed and as a result, the death rates are rising day by day. If skin cancer is detected early the survival rate increases, but most people are deprived of it as the detection takes time, money, and pain. A smartphone-based skin cancer detection system can serve a lot of people in this regard. Image processing has brought many revolutionary changes in recent times. Moreover, CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) has performed well these days in terms of image pattern analysis and classification. In this study, the corroboration of image processing has been established with CNN in a smartphone-based skin cancer detection system to detect skin cancer from skin lesion images. The proposed method has achieved 85% of accuracy with an F1-score of 86% on test data with Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.70 and Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.71.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT51525.2021.9579966","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 12th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9579467/9579470/09579966.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 12th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT51525.2021.9579966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9579470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smartphone-based Skin Cancer Detection using Image Processing and Convolutional Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation coefficient","Image segmentation","Pain","Lighting","Distortion","Skin","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Skin Cancer","Malignant Melanoma","Benign Melanoma","Convolutional Neural Network","Image Processing","Android"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9579966/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Smartphone-based Skin Cancer Detection using Image Processing and Convolutional Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9579966/","publicationDate":"6 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smartphone-based Skin Cancer Detection using Image Processing and Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Kharagpur, India","sourcePdf":"187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046235S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9579467","isNumber":"9579470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9579467","xplore-issue":"9579470","articleId":"9579966","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-07"},{"_id":9579979,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Previously we reported that a waveform equalization using a two-dimensional finite impulse response (TD-FIR) filter or an inter-track interference (ITI) canceler reduced the influence of ITI. We also proposed a neural network detector (NND), and evaluated the performance of the first decoding by the NND. In this paper, we propose the NND which iteratively calculates the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) as the decoding reliability using the returned sum-product (SP) decoder output sequence in addition to the TD-FIR filter output sequence. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of the iterative decoding system using an NND, and compare it to that of the system using a soft-output Viterbi algorithm (SOVA) detector with the signal-dependent noise predictor.","doi":"10.1109/INTERMAG42984.2021.9579979","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Magnetic Conference (INTERMAG)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INTERMAG42984.2021.9579979","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9579503","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Magnetic Conference (INTERMAG)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9579468/9579503/09579979.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study on Iterative Decoding by Neural Network Detector in SMR System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9579979/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Study on Iterative Decoding by Neural Network Detector in SMR System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9579979/","publicationDate":"April 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","conferenceDate":"26-30 April 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 April 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study on Iterative Decoding by Neural Network Detector in SMR System","confLoc":"LYON, France","sourcePdf":"2021002800.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054445S","chronDate":"26-30 April 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9579468","isNumber":"9579503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9579468","xplore-issue":"9579503","articleId":"9579979","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9579995,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

Bitter gourd is known for its usage for medicinal purposes in Asian countries. Bitter gourd could be a wealthy source of vitamins and minerals. It contains press, magnesium, potassium, and vitamins like A and C. Different anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds are showed in Bitter gourd. Separating diseased vegetables from healthy ones of medium size vegetables is one tough job as well as costly for farmers. We propose a system which detects diseased or even defected bitter Gourd. We used Deep Learning (DL) to achieve the goal. Image processing is one of the most common yet interesting fields of DL. We used Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to process images of Bitter Gourd. We created three different models by diversifying Convolutional Layer by number and its value. We are giving farmers a brief instrument utilizing Deep Learning that makes a difference select the non-absconded thing. The world is developing with AI within the future. So why not an agriculturist they are moreover utilizing this digitalization. We got some interesting results through the process and choose the model that performed best without test result and evaluation result over-fitting.
