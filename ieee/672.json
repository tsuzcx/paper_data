The system was being developed to reduce the requirement for skilled operator in single cell electrical measurement. We tested the system function for single cell penetration via finite element simulation. Based on the results, the single cell can be penetrated at fluid velocity of 5.3 \u00b5m/s.

The complex nature of floods and its responses make it the most challenging and important task of the researcher. Conventional methods for establishing the relationships between input and output data need to understand the behavior of the system, however the relationship is complex and highly nonlinear. To provide an alternative approach for accurate flood prediction, an artificial neural network which is capable of modeling nonlinear and complex systems is presented in this paper. A Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) was developed for flood water level prediction at Kelang river located at Petaling Bridge. The peak water levels during flood events were used to train, test and validate the network. The result shows that the RBFNN model can be considered as a suitable technique for predicting flood water level. Nevertheless, with the implementation of Inverse Model cascaded with the RBFNN model the result show significant improvement.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSCE.2013.6720031","startPage":"577","endPage":"581","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Control System, Computing and Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSCE.2013.6720031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6719916","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Control System, Computing and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/6709841/6719916/06720031.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling flood prediction using Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) and inverse model: A comparative study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6720031/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modelling flood prediction using Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) and inverse model: A comparative study","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6720031/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14047200","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2014","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2013-Dec. 1 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling flood prediction using Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) and inverse model: A comparative study","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"00110ID198.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082495S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2013-Dec. 1 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6709841","isNumber":"6719916","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6709841","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6719916","articleId":"6720031","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":6720032,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

On the other hand, it requires 850 ms to discharge completely without an external load. We have measured the capacitance of the electrodes as 0.37 pF in air (room environment) medium, on the other hand in distilled water medium electrodes capacitance is 0.77 pF. This is because of the high dielectric constant of distilled water (80.1). We have also measured electrodes capacitance by changing the medium to microbio objects such as; yeast cells (5 pF) and live bacteria cells (30 pF). Results showed that, bacteria have a higher electrical capacitance rather than yeast.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSCE.2013.6720032","pdfPath":"/iel7/6709841/6719916/06720032.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Control System, Computing and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Control System, Computing and Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSCE.2013.6720032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6719916","endPage":"585","startPage":"582","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrical characterizations of electrodes microfluidics system for microbio object analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6720032/","displayDocTitle":"Electrical characterizations of electrodes microfluidics system for microbio object analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2013-Dec. 1 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6720032/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14047154","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrical characterizations of electrodes microfluidics system for microbio object analysis","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"00111ID199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076686S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2013-Dec. 1 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6709841","isNumber":"6719916","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6709841","xplore-issue":"6719916","articleId":"6720032","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6720033,"authors":[{"name":"Maizura Mohd Sani","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Mara, Shah Alam, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Maizura Mohd","lastName":"Sani","id":"37400918900"},{"name":"Suhaili Beeran Kutty","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Mara, Shah Alam, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Suhaili Beeran","lastName":"Kutty","id":"37071112800"},{"name":"Hasmila Akmar Omar","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Mara, Shah Alam, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Hasmila Akmar","lastName":"Omar","id":"38238340100"},{"name":"Ili Nadia Md Isa","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Mara, Shah Alam, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Ili Nadia Md","lastName":"Isa","id":"37847920100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1508-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1506-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6720033","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":184},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","Training","Testing","Conferences","Biological neural networks","Image color analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["botany","image recognition","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orchid species classification","neural network","botanical plant","color recognition","root recognition","petal shape recognition","size recognition","Dendrobium Madame Pampadour","Dendrobium Cqompactum","image processing techniques","classification rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orchid Classification","Neural Network","Dendrobium Madame Pampadour","Dendrobium Compactum"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6720033","abstract":"Orchid species have a largest families among the botanical plant.

Single cell characterization could be related to many significant applications including early disease diagnosis. However to perform the single cell manipulation, firstly a single cell have to be isolated and a platform for the cell manipulation have to be provided. One of the methods to trap a single cell is by using hydrodynamic trapping in the microfluidic channel. This study provides a finite element model for single cell trapping for a yeast cell model. The objectives of the simulations are to obtain the appropriate channels' geometry and optimized ratio of the fluid's inlet and suction flow rate to trap a single yeast cell. Trap channel was designed to trap a 5 \u03bcm yeast cell with a suction hole placed in the end of the trap channel. Design geometry and ratio of fluid flow rates referring to the hydrodynamic concept were studied for the cell trapping model. The analysis was carried out using numerical solutions from the finite element ABAQUS-FEA software. Using the cell trapping model, a single yeast cell able to be trapped into the trap channel with optimized channel's suction hole's geometry and appropriate fluid's inlet and suction flow rate ratio.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6719916","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSCE.2013.6720035","doi":"10.1109/ICCSCE.2013.6720035","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Control System, Computing and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Control System, Computing and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/6709841/6719916/06720035.pdf","startPage":"596","endPage":"601","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Charge carrier processes","Hydrodynamics","Mathematical model","Fluids","Finite element analysis","Microfluidics","Resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric potentials","biomechanics","cellular biophysics","electrohydrodynamics","finite element analysis","microchannel flow","microorganisms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single cell trapping","microfluidic channel","hydrodynamic manipulation","microfluidic devices","single cell analysis","cell mechanical characterization","cell electrical characterization","disease diagnosis","single cell manipulation","hydrodynamic trapping","finite element model","channel geometry","optimized ratio","fluid inlet flow rate","suction flow rate","single yeast cell model","design geometry","numerical solutions","finite element ABAQUS-FEA software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["single cell","finite element","microfluidic","cell trapping"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single cell trapping in microfluidic channel via hydrodynamic manipulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6720035","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6720035/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2013-Dec. 1 2013","displayDocTitle":"Single cell trapping in microfluidic channel via hydrodynamic manipulation","htmlLink":"/document/6720035/","accessionNumber":"14047168","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single cell trapping in microfluidic channel via hydrodynamic manipulation","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"00114ID202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069478S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2013-Dec. 1 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6709841","isNumber":"6719916","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6709841","xplore-issue":"6719916","articleId":"6720035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6720109,"authors":[{"name":"Wangchao Le","affiliation":["School of Computing, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/6915958/6720109/6720109-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wangchao Le received the PhD degree from the University of Utah, specialized in data management and analysis.

Existing techniques either rely on constructing a distance matrix for pruning the search space or building summaries from the RDF graphs for query processing. In this work, we show that existing techniques have serious limitations in dealing with realistic, large RDF data with tens of millions of triples. Furthermore, the existing summarization techniques may lead to incorrect/incomplete results. To address these issues, we propose an effective summarization algorithm to summarize the RDF data. Given a keyword query, the summaries lend significant pruning powers to exploratory keyword search and result in much better efficiency compared to previous works. Unlike existing techniques, our search algorithms always return correct results. Besides, the summaries we built can be updated incrementally and efficiently. Experiments on both benchmark and large real RDF data sets show that our techniques are scalable and efficient.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2014.2302294","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/69/6915958/06720109.pdf","startPage":"2774","endPage":"2788","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2014.2302294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6915958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable Keyword Search on Large RDF Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Scalable Keyword Search on Large RDF Data","volume":"26","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2014","accessionNumber":"14648352","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6720109/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6720109/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable Keyword Search on Large RDF Data","sourcePdf":"tkde-li-2302294-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08768S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"6915958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6915958","articleId":"6720109","onlineDate":"23 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6720114,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Tajaldini","affiliation":["School of Physics, University Sains Malaysia, Georgetown, Malaysia"],"bio":{"p":["Mehdi Tajaldini received the B.Sc. degree in atomic physics and the M.Sc. degree in laser and photonics from the University of Vali-Asr, Rafsanjan, Iran, in 2003 and 2006, respectively.

Crystalline polydiacetylene is used as the core layer to allow for the creation of a power splitter with a high number of outputs with the shortest possible multimode waveguide length operating in the nonlinear regime. The 11 high-contrast, high-resolution images at the end of the multimode waveguide in the simulated power splitter have a high power balance, whereas access to a high number of self-images is not possible under the linear regime in the proposed length range. The compact dimensions and ideal performance of the device are established according to optimized parameters. The proposed regime can be extended to the design of M \u00d7 N power splitters. The results of this study indicate that nonlinear modal propagation analysis solves the miniaturization problem for all-optical devices based on MMI couplers to achieve multiple functions in a compact planar integrated circuit and also overcomes the limitations of previously proposed methods for nonlinear MMI. The results are verified using a numerical method.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2014.2302032","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/6740872/06720114.pdf","startPage":"1282","endPage":"1289","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2014.2302032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6740872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation of an Ultra-Compact Multimode Interference Power Splitter Based on Kerr Nonlinear Effect","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6720114/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April1,  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Simulation of an Ultra-Compact Multimode Interference Power Splitter Based on Kerr Nonlinear Effect","volume":"32","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2014","accessionNumber":"14111636","publicationDate":"April1, 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6720114/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of an Ultra-Compact Multimode Interference Power Splitter Based on Kerr Nonlinear Effect","sourcePdf":"jlt-tajaldini-2302032-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071521S","chronDate":"April1,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6740872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6740872","articleId":"6720114","onlineDate":"23 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6720118,"authors":[{"name":"Tzu-Ming Lin","affiliation":["Information and Communications Research Laboratories, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tzu-Ming","lastName":"Lin","id":"37933000100"},{"name":"Chia-Han Lee","affiliation":["Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Han","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085347839"},{"name":"Jen-Po Cheng","affiliation":["Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jen-Po","lastName":"Cheng","id":"38238529700"},{"name":"Wen-Tsuen Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Tsuen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085365420"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6720118","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":109,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2180},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nickel","Silicon","Educational Activities Board","Radio access networks","Synchronization","Loading","Vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","cellular radio","Long Term Evolution","quality of service","radio access networks","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["The prioritized random access with dynamic access barring","PRADA framework","3GPP LTE-A networks","machine-type communications devices","cellular-based MTC","radio access network overload","RAN overload","quality of service","QoS","Third-Generation Partnership Project networks","Long-Term Evolution Advanced networks","random access channel resources","RACH resource preallocation","class-dependent back-off procedures","simultaneous random access requests"]},{"kwd":["Access barring","long-term evolution-A (LTE-A)","machine-to-machine (M2M)","machine-type communication (MTC)","random access network (RAN)"]}],"abstract":"Due to the huge amount of machine-type communications (MTC) devices, radio access network (RAN) overload is a critical issue in cellular-based MTC.

This paper proposes a new symmetrical SURF descriptor to enrich the power of SURF to detect all possible symmetrical matching pairs through a mirroring transformation. A vehicle make and model recognition (MMR) application is then adopted to prove the practicability and feasibility of the method. To detect vehicles from the road, the proposed symmetrical descriptor is first applied to determine the region of interest of each vehicle from the road without using any motion features. This scheme provides two advantages: there is no need for background subtraction and it is extremely efficient for real-time applications. Two MMR challenges, namely multiplicity and ambiguity problems, are then addressed. The multiplicity problem stems from one vehicle model often having different model shapes on the road. The ambiguity problem results from vehicles from different companies often sharing similar shapes. To address these two problems, a grid division scheme is proposed to separate a vehicle into several grids; different weak classifiers that are trained on these grids are then integrated to build a strong ensemble classifier. The histogram of gradient and SURF descriptors are adopted to train the weak classifiers through a support vector machine learning algorithm. Because of the rich representation power of the grid-based method and the high accuracy of vehicle detection, the ensemble classifier can accurately recognize each vehicle.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2013.2294646","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/6729098/06720121.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2013.2294646","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6729098","startPage":"6","endPage":"20","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symmetrical SURF and Its Applications to Vehicle Detection and Vehicle Make and Model Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6720121","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Symmetrical SURF and Its Applications to Vehicle Detection and Vehicle Make and Model Recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6720121/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14078204","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6720121/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symmetrical SURF and Its Applications to Vehicle Detection and Vehicle Make and Model Recognition","sourcePdf":"tits-hsieh-2294646-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139046S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"6729098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"114","xplore-issue":"6729098","articleId":"6720121","onlineDate":"23 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6720129,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Lu","affiliation":["Information Network Laboratory, Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085445777"},{"name":"Peilin Hong","affiliation":["Information Network Laboratory, Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Peilin","lastName":"Hong","id":"37274854000"},{"name":"Kaiping Xue","affiliation":["Information Network Laboratory, Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Kaiping","lastName":"Xue","id":"37665705100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6720129","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":385},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a generalized interrelay interference cancelation (gIRIC) scheme for a two-path relay model in multisource systems.

An inductively coupled wireless power transmission system was set up using the 3-D inductor in combination with a solenoid transmitting coil. At the resonant frequency of 1.6 MHz, the peak-to-peak output open circuit voltage could reach 5.2 V with a maximum power transmission efficiency of 11.74% and an output power of 35.5 mW. Effects of the load impedance and transmission distance on the output power were also investigated.

The main contributions are three-fold. First, from the perspective of image statistics, a joint statistical modeling (JSM) in an adaptive hybrid space-transform domain is established, which offers a powerful mechanism of combining local smoothness and nonlocal self-similarity simultaneously to ensure a more reliable and robust estimation. Second, a new form of minimization functional for solving the image inverse problem is formulated using JSM under a regularization-based framework. Finally, in order to make JSM tractable and robust, a new Split Bregman-based algorithm is developed to efficiently solve the above severely underdetermined inverse problem associated with theoretical proof of convergence. Extensive experiments on image inpainting, image deblurring, and mixed Gaussian plus salt-and-pepper noise removal applications verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/6824288/06720157.pdf","startPage":"915","endPage":"928","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2302380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2302380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6824288","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6720157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Restoration Using Joint Statistical Modeling in a Space-Transform Domain","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image restoration","Transforms","Three-dimensional displays","Inverse problems","Image edge detection","Mathematical model","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","Gaussian noise","image denoising","image restoration","inverse problems","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mixed Gaussian plus salt-and-pepper noise removal application","robust estimation","image deblurring","image inpainting","convergence theoretical proof","split Bregman based algorithm","regularization based framework","JSM","image inverse problem","adaptive hybrid space transform domain","image statistics","natural image local smoothness","natural image nonlocal self similarity","high fidelity image restoration","joint statistical modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image restoration","statistical modeling","optimi-zation","image inpainting","image deblurring"]},{"kwd":["Image deblurring","image inpainting","image restoration","optimization","statistical modeling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6720157/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Image Restoration Using Joint Statistical Modeling in a Space-Transform Domain","volume":"24","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6720157/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14362447","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Major State Basic Research Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2009CB320905"},{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"61272386, 61370114 and 61103088"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Restoration Using Joint Statistical Modeling in a Space-Transform Domain","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-zhang-2302380-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124106S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6824288","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"6824288","articleId":"6720157","onlineDate":"23 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6720158,"authors":[{"name":"Ganesh R.

Inductive power transfer (IPT) is a method that can be used to transfer power to EVs over an air-gap and can dramatically increase the range, convenience, and safety of EV battery charging. One of the major difficulties is determining the physical sizes of the primary IPT coupler, buried in the roadway, and the EV mounted secondary coupler. This is mainly due to the variation in vehicle classes and charging locations that may be encountered. This paper seeks to determine if suitably sized couplers can be selected, which can realize all these demands. A recently proposed EV charging coupler, known as the Double-D (DD), which has been shown to provide the best power to size ratio over typical expected air gaps is selected. As such a method to select the best design from eight approximately square DD couplers ranging from 300 to 1000 mm in length to meet the challenge of delivering high power over large air-gaps is presented. The performance of these couplers, or power pads, is simulated and the results can be used to select couplers for EV charging systems. A practical design example is presented involving the IPT charging of sedans and SUVs in multiple practical charging locations.

In satellite communication networks, the increase of the operating frequencies above 10 GHz, which is mainly driven by the need of higher bandwidth, results in heavier signal attenuation due to various atmospheric effects. Precipitation and mainly rain induce high attenuation over earth-space links and is the most important factor limiting both links' availability and reliability. In order to mitigate the rain fade effects to the links performance the site diversity technique can be employed. In the present paper, a new method for predicting the joint complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of the rain attenuation using the Copulas functions is presented. The advantages of using Copulas are: (i) the single site rain attenuation is not required to be statistically modeled and (ii) only one parameter is employed to couple the two random variables corresponding to the rain attenuation of each one of the two links. The proposed model is compared to the model recommended by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in ITU-R P. 618-10 and it is shown to perform much better. Finally, the model is evaluated for micro scale and large scale diversity scenarios with very encouraging results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6720181/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"62","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2014","accessionNumber":"14220087","htmlLink":"/document/6720181/","displayDocTitle":"On the Prediction of Joint Rain Attenuation Statistics in Earth-Space Diversity Systems Using Copulas","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Prediction of Joint Rain Attenuation Statistics in Earth-Space Diversity Systems Using Copulas","sourcePdf":"tap-panagopoulos-2302302-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093324S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6782660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6782660","articleId":"6720181","onlineDate":"23 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6720185,"authors":[{"name":"Rahul Pandey","affiliation":["The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Pandey","id":"37085419229"},{"name":"Vinay Saripalli","affiliation":["The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Vinay","lastName":"Saripalli","id":"37400224000"},{"name":"Jaydeep P.

We aim to minimize the sum power over base stations (BSs) while guaranteeing the worst case SINR for each user. We propose a decentralized robust beamforming design which relies only on local imperfect channel state information and limited backhaul signaling. First, the non-convex problem is approximated by a convex one via the semidefinite relaxation and S-Procedure methods. Then, we propose a primal decomposition method to equivalently turn the approximated problem into a network-level master problem and BS-level subproblems, which can be optimally solved using an iterative projected subgradient method and a convex optimization solver, respectively. The proposed algorithm is applicable when it yields a rank-one solution providing an optimal solution also for the original problem. Computational and backhaul signaling loads per iteration are reduced as compared with the existing algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6720194/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2014","volume":"21","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"14066433","publicationDate":"March 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6720194/","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2014","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Robust Beamforming for Coordinated Multi-Cell MISO Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Robust Beamforming for Coordinated Multi-Cell MISO Networks","sourcePdf":"lsp-pennanen-2302387-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088156S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6712948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6712948","articleId":"6720194","onlineDate":"23 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6720204,"authors":[{"name":"Ling Tong","affiliation":["Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, Laboratory on Cardiovascular Imaging and Dynamics, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Tong","id":"37071662500"},{"name":"Alessandro Ramalli","affiliation":["Department of Information, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Firenze, Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Ramalli","id":"37705628900"},{"name":"Ruta Jasaityte","affiliation":["Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, Laboratory on Cardiovascular Imaging and Dynamics, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Ruta","lastName":"Jasaityte","id":"38260424700"},{"name":"Piero Tortoli","affiliation":["Department of Information, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Firenze, Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Piero","lastName":"Tortoli","id":"37297991300"},{"name":"Jan D'hooge","affiliation":["Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, Laboratory on Cardiovascular Imaging and Dynamics, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"D'hooge","id":"37277201000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0062"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-254X"}],"articleNumber":"6720204","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":86,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1288},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"}],"abstract":"High frame rate (HFR) echocardiography may be of benefit for functional analysis of the heart. In current clinical equipment, HFR is obtained using multi-line acquisition (MLA) which typically requires broadening of transmit beams. As this may result in a significant degradation of spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the capacity of MLA to obtain high quality HFR images remains limited. As an alternative, we have demonstrated by computer simulation that simultaneously transmitting multiple focused beams into different directions [multi-line transmit (MLT)], can increase the frame rate without significantly compromising the spatial resolution or SNR. This study aimed to experimentally verify these theoretical predictions both in vitro and in vivo to demonstrate, for the first time, that cardiac MLT imaging is feasible. Hereto, the ultrasound advanced open platform, equipped with a 2.0 MHz phased array, was programmed to interleave MLT and conventional single line transmit (SLT) beam forming. Using these two beam forming methods, images of phantoms and healthy volunteers were acquired and investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results confirmed our simulations that image quality of a 4MLT imaging system with a Tukey apodization scheme is very competitive to that of SLT while providing a 4 times higher frame rate. It is also demonstrated that MLT can be combined with MLA to provide images at 12-to 16-fold frame rate (about 340-450 Hz) without significantly compromising spatial resolution and SNR. This is thus the first study to demonstrate that this new ultrasound imaging paradigm is viable which could have significant impact on future cardiac ultrasound systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/6823194/06720204.pdf","startPage":"1205","endPage":"1219","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

Moreover, high reactive power demand makes it more challenging due to the limitation of reactive capability of the wind generating system. A Remote Area Power Supply (RAPS) system consisting of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG), a hybrid energy storage, a dump load and a mains load is considered in this paper. The hybrid energy storage consists of a battery storage and a supercapacitor where both are connected to the DC bus of the RAPS system. An energy management algorithm (EMA) is proposed for the hybrid energy storage with a view to improve the performance of the battery storage. A synchronous condenser is employed to provide reactive power and inertial support to the RAPS system. A coordinated control approach is developed to manage the active and reactive power flows among the RAPS components. In this regard, individual controllers for each RAPS component have been developed for effective management of the RAPS components. Through simulation studies carried out using detailed model in MATLAB Simulink, it has been demonstrated that the proposed method is capable of achieving: a) robust voltage and frequency regulation (in terms of their acceptable bandwidths), b) effective management of the hybrid storage system, c) reactive power capability and inertial support by the synchronous condenser, and d) maximum power extraction from wind.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Management of Battery-Supercapacitor Hybrid Energy Storage and Synchronous Condenser for Isolated Operation of PMSG Based Variable-Speed Wind Turbine Generating Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2013.2287874","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/6740878/06720212.pdf","startPage":"944","endPage":"953","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2013.2287874","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6740878","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6720212","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6720212/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","displayDocTitle":"Management of Battery-Supercapacitor Hybrid Energy Storage and Synchronous Condenser for Isolated Operation of PMSG Based Variable-Speed Wind Turbine Generating Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6720212/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2014","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14111667","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Management of Battery-Supercapacitor Hybrid Energy Storage and Synchronous Condenser for Isolated Operation of PMSG Based Variable-Speed Wind Turbine Generating Systems","sourcePdf":"tsg-muttaqi-2287874-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051169S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6740878","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"157","xplore-issue":"6740878","articleId":"6720212","onlineDate":"23 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6720214,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Ferriss","affiliation":["IBM T.J.

Although several algorithms have been addressed in the literature to mitigate the effects of phase noise, there are two unsolvable problems for the current study of phase noise suppression that the CPE correction algorithms are based on the perfect channel state information and the ICI suppression methods perform poorly or will reduce the spectral efficiency in some cases. In this paper, we propose two novel algorithms for phase noise suppression.

An online self-adjusting factor was designed to adjust the amplitude of symbolic functions in order to reduce chattering. Furthermore, a real-time RBF neural network was used to estimate and compensate the influence caused by coupling, unknown boundary disturbances and uncertainties.

Although traditional Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) beamformer [1] based on classical techniques under minimizing a least-squares objective function has the optimum capabilities of signal protection, interference removal and noise reduction in Gaussian noise environment, it loses optimality when the noise such as impulse noise deviates from Gaussian distribution. In this paper, an effective beamforming algorithm based on a robust objective function is proposed to mitigate impulse noise. The proposed method does not require the prior knowledge of impulse noise distribution and can give a closed-form solution. A comparison is performed between the proposed algorithm and MVDR. The proposed algorithm clearly outperforms MVDR.","doi":"10.1109/ICInfA.2013.6720313","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation (ICIA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6709836/6720259/06720313.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6720259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICInfA.2013.6720313","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation (ICIA)","startPage":"297","endPage":"300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust adaptive beamforming for impulse noise environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6720313","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Robust adaptive beamforming for impulse noise environments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6720313/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6720313/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14059904","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust adaptive beamforming for impulse noise environments","confLoc":"Yinchuan, China","sourcePdf":"0054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051033S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6709836","isNumber":"6720259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6709836","xplore-issue":"6720259","articleId":"6720313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6720315,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Chen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Nondestructive, Test (Ministry of Education), Nanchang Hangkong University, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37089068492"},{"name":"Ming Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Nondestructive, Test (Ministry of Education), Nanchang Hangkong University, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Li","id":"37089088354"},{"name":"Xi Chen","affiliation":["Nanchang Hangkong University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, CN"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Chen","id":"37089091644"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1334-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6720315","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6720315","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Generators","Genetic algorithms","Optimization","Numerical models","Computational modeling","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid genetic algorithm","cloud model","dynamic environment","genetic algorithms","GA","dynamic optimization problems","DOP","quantitative numerical values","dynamic landscape","conceivable moving direction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud model","hybrid genetic algorithm","dynamic optimization problems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICInfA.2013.6720315","pdfPath":"/iel7/6709836/6720259/06720315.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation (ICIA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation (ICIA)","startPage":"306","endPage":"311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6720259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICInfA.2013.6720315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid genetic algorithm based on cloud model in dynamic environment","abstract":"In recent years there is a growing interest in the research of applying genetic algorithms (GAs) for dynamic optimization problems (DOPs), and several approaches have developed to deal with DOPs.

The performance of collaborative beamforming has been well analyzed for the case without phase offset in the literature. However, there always exists the phase ambiguity caused by carrier phase jitter between the transmitter and receiver nodes in a practical system. Although the effects of imperfect phase have been studied for Uniform node distribution and Tikhonov phase noise distribution, the performance analysis of collaborative beamforming with arbitrary node distributions and any phase offset is still an open issue. This paper proposes a unified method to evaluate the performance of collaborative beamforming in the case of phase noise. Since the non-parametric kernel method is used to build the probability density functions of node and phase offset distributions, the proposed non-parametric approach can provide accurate performance analysis for various node and phase noise distributions. The simulation results verify the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ICInfA.2013.6720335","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation (ICIA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6709836/6720259/06720335.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6720259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICInfA.2013.6720335","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation (ICIA)","startPage":"419","endPage":"423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characteristics of collaborative beamforming for wireless sensor networks in phase noise environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6720335","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Characteristics of collaborative beamforming for wireless sensor networks in phase noise environments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6720335/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6720335/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14059881","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characteristics of collaborative beamforming for wireless sensor networks in phase noise environments","confLoc":"Yinchuan, China","sourcePdf":"0076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053639S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6709836","isNumber":"6720259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6709836","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6720259","articleId":"6720335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6720343,"authors":[{"name":"Songpu Yang","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, No.37 Xueyuan Road, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Songpu","lastName":"Yang"},{"name":"Yangzhu Wang","affiliation":["Research Institute of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, Beihang University, No.37 Xueyuan Road, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yangzhu","lastName":"Wang"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1334-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6720343","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Navigation","Cameras","Kalman filters","Equations","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft landing guidance","autonomous aerial vehicles","computer vision","ground support systems","image sequences","Kalman filters","video cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual navigation technology","unmanned aerial vehicle landing","UAV landing","ground visual navigation system","space intersection model","sequence images","theodolites","azimuth","optical axises","cameras","adjustment model","adjustment theory","calculation precision","Kalman filter","position accuracy","3ds Max software","elevation direction","vision navigation system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Visual Navigation","Space Intersection","Adjustment Method","Kalman Filter","3ds Max"]}],"abstract":"Guide the UAV landing by using ground visual navigation system.

As traditional control structure only controls sink rate during flare phase, which can't guarantee safe touchdown pitch angle under disturbances. A fuzzy logic scheme is employed to make a compromise between trajectory tracking and touchdown security.

The explicit method for the finite element model is employed in order to perform all the steps of the algorithm on the GPUs and achieve a real-time simulation.","doi":"10.1109/ICInfA.2013.6720373","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation (ICIA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation (ICIA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6709836/6720259/06720373.pdf","startPage":"631","endPage":"636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICInfA.2013.6720373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6720259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A GPU-accelerated finite element solver for simulation of soft-body deformation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6720373","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6720373/","displayDocTitle":"A GPU-accelerated finite element solver for simulation of soft-body deformation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14059983","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6720373/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A GPU-accelerated finite element solver for simulation of soft-body deformation","confLoc":"Yinchuan, China","sourcePdf":"0114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068795S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6709836","isNumber":"6720259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6709836","xplore-issue":"6720259","articleId":"6720373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6720432,"authors":[{"name":"Yuancai Cong","affiliation":["Department of Control Engineering, Naval Aeronautical and Astronautical University, Yantai, Shandong Province, China"],"firstName":"Yuancai","lastName":"Cong","id":"37086755731"},{"name":"Shaolei Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Control Engineering, Naval Aeronautical and Astronautical University, Yantai, Shandong Province, China"],"firstName":"Shaolei","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085531916"},{"name":"Yuhang Kang","affiliation":["Department of Control Engineering, Naval Aeronautical and Astronautical University, Yantai, Shandong Province, China"],"firstName":"Yuhang","lastName":"Kang","id":"37085510447"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1334-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6720432","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrices","Matrix decomposition","Singular value decomposition","Sampling methods","Correlation coefficient","Nonlinear filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrices","nonlinear filters","sampling methods","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrix decomposition","deterministic sampling filters","nonlinear filters","square root","diagonal matrix","normal deviation","correlated coefficient matrix","singular value decomposition","sampling points"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nonlinear Filter","Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)","Correlated Coefficient Matrix"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6720432","abstract":"Nonlinear filters have been developed for decades and a variety of methods have been utilized to improve the performance of these nonlinear filters. A class of nonlinear filters based on deterministic sampling method received widespread concern recently which can be used instead of EKFs. In the deterministic sampling filters, it needs matrix decomposition to get the square root of covariance matrix while choosing sample points, and usually uses Cholesky decomposition or singular value decomposition of covariance matrix directly. In this paper, the covariance matrix is decomposed into diagonal matrix of normal deviation and correlated coefficient matrix, which eliminates the dimension effect of the state. Then through an implementation of singular value decomposition to correlated coefficient matrix, a set of more accurate sampling points can be got which guarantee the new filter provides a superior performance. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is validated through a simulation.","doi":"10.1109/ICInfA.2013.6720432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICInfA.2013.6720432","startPage":"954","endPage":"958","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation (ICIA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6709836/6720259/06720432.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation (ICIA)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6720259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Covariance matrix decomposition in deterministic sampling filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Covariance matrix decomposition in deterministic sampling filters","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6720432/","accessionNumber":"14059787","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6720432/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Covariance matrix decomposition in deterministic sampling filters","confLoc":"Yinchuan, China","sourcePdf":"0173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051399S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6709836","isNumber":"6720259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6709836","xplore-issue":"6720259","articleId":"6720432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6720446,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenghua Wu","affiliation":["Department of Control Science and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Zhenghua","lastName":"Wu","id":"38183872900"},{"name":"Qiang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Control Science and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37065708200"},{"name":"Yi Shen","affiliation":["Department of Control Science and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Shen","id":"37085842085"},{"name":"Jie Liu","affiliation":["Department of Control Science and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Liu","id":"38240092100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1334-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6720446","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sparse matrices","Compressed sensing","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Bipartite graph","Sensors","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","graph theory","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing","sparse signals","random projections","deterministic projections","measurement mode","random matrices","expander graphs","CS recovery","probabilistic method","second-largest eigenvalue","adjacency matrix","random expanders","optimized expanders"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive Sensing","Expander Graph","Adjacency matrix","Eigenvalue"]}],"abstract":"Compressive Sensing (CS) shows that sparse signals can be exactly recovered from a limited number of random or deterministic projections when the measurement mode satisfies some specified conditions. Random matrices, with the drawbacks of large storage, low efficiency and high complexity, are hard to use in practical applications.

In this paper, we propose a parameter based on the second-largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix to select optimized expanders from random expanders.

By having the compact structure, the robots had some limitations in locomotion velocity and enduring time. Hence, a mother-son robot cooperation system was proposed to solve these limitations. A novel amphibious spherical robot was designed as the mother robot to carry the microrobots as son robots for collaboration. The spherical mother robot consisted of a sealed hemispheroid, two openable quarter spherical shells, a plastic circular plate, a plastic shelf for carrying microrobots and four actuating units. Each unit was composed of a water jet propeller and two servo motors, each of which could rotate 90\u00b0 in horizontal or vertical direction respectively. The robot could implement on-land locomotion, as well as underwater locomotion. In this paper, we developed the prototype mother robot and did the force analysis of the actuating system in horizontal direction and vertical direction. And plenty of underwater experiments of the robot in the semi-submerged state were conducted to evaluate the underwater performance, including the moving forward experiments in the moving forward experiments of the robot actuated by two main actuating units and four actuating units.

The challenge of video-based face recognition comes from several aspects. First, video data involves many frames, which increases data size and processing complexity. Second, key frames extracted from videos are usually of high intra-personal discrepancy due to variations in expressions, poses, and illuminations. In order to address these problems, we propose a novel semantic based subspace model to improve the performance of video based face recognition. The basic idea is to construct an appropriate low-dimensional subspace for each person, upon which a semantic model is built to classify the key frames of the person into specific class. After the semantic classification, the key frames belonging to the same classes, i.e. the same semantics, are used to train the linear classifiers for recognition. Extensive experiments on a large face video database (XM2VTS) clearly show that our approach obtains a significant performance improvement over the traditional approaches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A semantic model for video based face recognition","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation (ICIA)","doi":"10.1109/ICInfA.2013.6720507","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation (ICIA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6709836/6720259/06720507.pdf","startPage":"1369","endPage":"1374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICInfA.2013.6720507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6720259","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6720507","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6720507/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A semantic model for video based face recognition","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6720507/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14059971","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A semantic model for video based face recognition","confLoc":"Yinchuan, China","sourcePdf":"0248.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108702S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6709836","isNumber":"6720259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6709836","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6720259","articleId":"6720507","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6720520,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Finally, the trained NN are tested through the F1 Montreal circuit in order to evaluate the vehicle performance in navigation and speed control.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAIS.2013.6720520","pdfPath":"/iel7/6709839/6720516/06720520.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAIS.2013.6720520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6720516","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of neural networks to design the controller for autonomous vehicles by learning driver's behavior","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6720520/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Application of neural networks to design the controller for autonomous vehicles by learning driver's behavior","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14060344","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6720520/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Nov. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of neural networks to design the controller for autonomous vehicles by learning driver's behavior","confLoc":"Nha Trang, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p1le.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056571S","chronDate":"25-28 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6709839","isNumber":"6720516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6709839","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6720516","articleId":"6720520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6720528,"authors":[{"name":"Quoc Hung Ngo","affiliation":["Computer Science Faculty, University of Information Technology, HoChiMinh City, Vietnam"],"lastName":"Quoc Hung Ngo","id":"38564792300"},{"name":"Dinh Dien","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, University of Sciences, Hochiminh City, Vietnam"],"lastName":"Dinh Dien","id":"38056327300"},{"name":"Werner Winiwarter","affiliation":["University of Vienna, Research Group Data Analytics and Computing, Wien, Austria"],"firstName":"Werner","lastName":"Winiwarter","id":"37284370700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0572-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0569-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0570-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6720528","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Dictionaries","Conferences","Accuracy","Training","Software","Hidden Markov models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural language processing","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid method","English-Vietnamese bilingual text","Vietnamese word segmentation","dictionary-based method","machine learning method","word boundary detection","English-Vietnamese pair comparison","English-Vietnamese text word alignment","English-Vietnamese bilingual corpus","EVBCorpus","EVBNews"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a hybrid approach for Vietnamese word segmentation.

Intermittent data dropouts may incur concurrently to all vehicle agents in this formulation. Demands on communication links and online data are limited with a perturbed state-feedback strategy, which consists of a static cooperative-state feedback and an online-optimizing perturbation. The former compensates for the interagent communication-coupled dynamics. The latter attends to constraints and data losses, adopting only decoupled objective functions. The state feedback gain is determined in accordance with the interconnection topology of the formation, which is described by a directed graph in this paper. The ADC - asymptotically dissipative constraint, is employed in the overriding control strategy of stabilizing agents such that the inter-operability between remote manoeuvres and local autonomous commands becomes practically realizable. The equilibrium-independent supply rate and storage function are used in the stabilizability condition in this development for the final-state tracking of the cooperative formation problem.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAIS.2013.6720552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAIS.2013.6720552","startPage":"190","endPage":"195","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6709839/6720516/06720552.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6720516","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel semi-automatic control strategy for multi-agent cooperative formation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6720552/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Nov. 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A novel semi-automatic control strategy for multi-agent cooperative formation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14060387","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6720552/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel semi-automatic control strategy for multi-agent cooperative formation","confLoc":"Nha Trang, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p190truong.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061341S","chronDate":"25-28 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6709839","isNumber":"6720516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6709839","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6720516","articleId":"6720552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6720557,"authors":[{"name":"Nguyen Khanh Quang","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Nguyen Khanh","lastName":"Quang","id":"38509232600"},{"name":"Doan Quang Vinh","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Danang, Danang, Vietnam"],"lastName":"Doan Quang Vinh","id":"37086720130"},{"name":"Nguyen D.

For enhancement of robustness, a flux angle estimator using an improved sliding mode observer is proposed to estimate the current and back electromotive force (EMF) as well as to derive the flux angle. These estimated values together with the computed rotor speed of the motor are fed back for the control purpose in both the current loop and the speed loop. To increase the performance of PMSM speed control, an integral sliding mode control (ISMC) is designed with integral operation to improve steady state accuracy against parameter variations and external disturbances. The developed controller has been implemented in an FPGA-based environment and the very high speed integrated circuit-hardware description language (VHDL) is adopted to show advantages of the proposed control system. By integrating the observer-based and integral sliding mode control techniques into speed control of a PMSM drive, the system performance can be substantially enhanced while improving its cost-effectiveness and reliability. The validity of the proposed approach is verified through simulation results based on Modelsim and Simulink co-simulation method.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAIS.2013.6720557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAIS.2013.6720557","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6709839/6720516/06720557.pdf","startPage":"218","endPage":"223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6720516","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6720557/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Observer-based integral sliding mode control for sensorless PMSM drives using FPGA","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14060343","htmlLink":"/document/6720557/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Observer-based integral sliding mode control for sensorless PMSM drives using FPGA","confLoc":"Nha Trang, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p218nguyen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068131S","chronDate":"25-28 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6709839","isNumber":"6720516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6709839","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6720516","articleId":"6720557","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6720565,"authors":[{"name":"Shoufeng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Curtin University, Perth, Australia"],"lastName":"Shoufeng Lin","id":"37087065386"},{"name":"Sven Nordholm","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Curtin University, Perth, Australia"],"firstName":"Sven","lastName":"Nordholm","id":"37274680800"},{"name":"Hai Huyen Dam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Curtin University, Perth, Australia"],"lastName":"Hai Huyen Dam","id":"37087065274"},{"name":"Pei Chee Yong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Curtin University, Perth, Australia"],"lastName":"Pei Chee Yong","id":"37087065826"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0572-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0569-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0570-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6720565","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6720565","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Microphones","Speech enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic noise","array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","speech enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive low-complexity coherence-based beamformer","adaptive coherence-based beamforming algorithm","speech signal","arbitrary direction of arrival","DOA","azimuthal plane","interfering speech signal","complex noisy acoustic environments","spatially selective speech enhancement schemes","single channel enhancement methods","speech quality perceptual evaluation","PESQ"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamformer","Coherence","Adaptive","Real-time","Interfering Speech","Diffuse Noise"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCAIS.2013.6720565","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6709839/6720516/06720565.pdf","startPage":"263","endPage":"266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAIS.2013.6720565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6720516","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive low-complexity coherence-based beamformer","abstract":"This paper presents an adaptive coherence-based beamforming algorithm that enhances a target speech signal from an arbitrary direction of arrival (DOA) in the azimuthal plane, while localising and suppressing the interfering speech signal and noise from other directions.

The neural network is used to approximate the uncertainty functions, where the weighting coefficients of the neural network are trained online. The robust adaptive control law is designed based on control Lyapunov function by using backstepping techniques and sliding mode control, thus global asymptotic stability is guaranteed for the case of ideal implementation of the neural network. The proposed controller is applied to an n-degrees-of-freedom robot.

In this paper, we present a novel idea for improvement in the four-dimensional parity scheme by adding parity bits in another direction i.e. diagonal in opposite direction.

We use the resulted labeled data as the input for the Ant Colony algorithm to derive classification rules, which are used to detect abnormal values. Finally, we exploit the spatial correlation between monitored attributes to differentiate between faulty sensor readings and emergency situations. Our experimental results on real patient dataset show that our proposed approach achieves a high level of detection accuracy, which in turn proves the effectiveness of this approach in enhancing the reliability of medical wireless sensors networks.","doi":"10.1109/HealthCom.2013.6720687","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 15th International Conference on e-Health Networking, Applications and Services (Healthcom 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 15th International Conference on e-Health Networking, Applications and Services (Healthcom 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6713381/6720623/06720687.pdf","startPage":"289","endPage":"293","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HealthCom.2013.6720687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6720623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliable vital sign collection in medical Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6720687","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6720687/","displayDocTitle":"Reliable vital sign collection in medical Wireless Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14060972","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6720687/","conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliable vital sign collection in medical Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"p289naseem.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049743S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6713381","isNumber":"6720623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713381","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6720623","articleId":"6720687","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6720694,"authors":[{"name":"Dramane Ouattara","affiliation":["University of Bordeaux, LaBRI, France"],"firstName":"Dramane","lastName":"Ouattara","id":"37085430776"},{"name":"Minh Thao Quach","affiliation":["University of Bordeaux, LaBRI, France"],"lastName":"Minh Thao Quach","id":"37086648502"},{"name":"Francine Krief","affiliation":["University of Bordeaux, LaBRI, France"],"firstName":"Francine","lastName":"Krief","id":"37268633900"},{"name":"Mohamed Aymen Chalouf","affiliation":["IRISA, University of Rennes 1, France"],"firstName":"Mohamed Aymen","lastName":"Chalouf","id":"37590082900"},{"name":"Hicham Khalife","affiliation":["Thales, France"],"firstName":"Hicham","lastName":"Khalife","id":"37295187000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5801-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5800-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6720694","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Hospitals","Radio transmitters","Mobile nodes","Radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical communication","cognitive radio","hospitals","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hospital area communication interference","cognitive radio networks","communication infrastructures","doctors","nurses","hospital patient communications","monitoring devices","electromagnetic waves","wireless networks","high-quality communication services","radio interferences","hospital environment","hospital networks"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigating the hospital area communication's interference using Cognitive Radio Networks","doi":"10.1109/HealthCom.2013.6720694","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6720623","endPage":"328","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 15th International Conference on e-Health Networking, Applications and Services (Healthcom 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 15th International Conference on e-Health Networking, Applications and Services (Healthcom 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6713381/6720623/06720694.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HealthCom.2013.6720694","startPage":"324","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6720694","abstract":"The communication infrastructures and devices in hospitals are becoming increasingly wireless because of doctors and nurses are mobile in their work.

Such systems are not designed under either power or bandwidth constraints. However, in certain scenarios involving remote communities in developing and underdeveloped world, both the above constraints could be acute. The present paper takes a first step towards a constrained design keeping such scenarios in view. Specifically, we propose a system where automated classification is performed on the ECG signals, and only anomalous signals are transmitted for further diagnosis and intervention, thereby saving bandwidth. Additionally, we propose compressive sampling as a low-power alternative to traditional Nyquist sampling method, which also lowers bandwidth requirement. Finally, we illustrate our method by designing such a compressive classifier using ECG signals from the widely used PhysioNet database. Specifically, we demonstrate that an average down sampling factor of three leads to desirable classification performance in terms of both sensitivity and specificity while substantially saving both power and bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/HealthCom.2013.6720699","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 15th International Conference on e-Health Networking, Applications and Services (Healthcom 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 15th International Conference on e-Health Networking, Applications and Services (Healthcom 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6713381/6720623/06720699.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HealthCom.2013.6720699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6720623","startPage":"350","endPage":"354","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Telecardiology: Hurst exponent based anomaly detection in compressively sampled ECG signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6720699","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Telecardiology: Hurst exponent based anomaly detection in compressively sampled ECG signals","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6720699/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14060852","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6720699/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Telecardiology: Hurst exponent based anomaly detection in compressively sampled ECG signals","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"p350chandra.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070592S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6713381","isNumber":"6720623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713381","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6720623","articleId":"6720699","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6720700,"authors":[{"name":"Hsin-Yi Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Hsin-Yi","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086711842"},{"name":"Sz-Ying Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"lastName":"Sz-Ying Liang","id":"37086712946"},{"name":"Yi-Lwun Ho","affiliation":["Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University"],"firstName":"Yi-Lwun","lastName":"Ho","id":"38468735200"},{"name":"Yen-Hung Lin","affiliation":["Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University"],"firstName":"Yen-Hung","lastName":"Lin","id":"38490249100"},{"name":"Hsi-Pin Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Hsi-Pin","lastName":"Ma","id":"37403465900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5801-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5800-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6720700","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":519},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Signal to noise ratio","Discrete wavelet transforms","Electromyography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","electrocardiography","electromyography","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete-wavelet-transform-based noise reduction","R wave detection","ECG signals","R peaks detection","DWT","nonstationary signals","wavelet function","thresholding method","denoising stage","MIT-BIH arrhythmia database","noise correction","R wave position","SNR","EMG","electromyogram signal"]}],"abstract":"There are two main research topics about ECG signal proposed. One is the noise reduction, and the other is R peaks detection. Both of the two algorithms are based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT). DWT is efficient for analyzing nonstationary signals like ECG signal. The Symlets wavelets (sym5) and soft-thresholding are chosen as the wavelet function and thresholding method to do noise correction at the first denoising stage. The second stage is R wave detection. The MIT-BIH arrhythmia database is used to verify proposed algorithm. We reconstruct the decomposition level 3 to 5. Choosing the adaptive threshold and window size are the key points to reduce error rate. Applying two thresholds leads to better performance, compared to applying one threshold. At the last stage, we do noise correction again.With the information of R wave position, a novel method is proposed to eliminate the electromyogram (EMG) signal. The algorithm for R wave detection has a sensitivity of 99.70% and a positive predictivity of 99.65%. The error rate is 0.65% under all kinds of situation (0.37% if ignoring 3 worst cases). For noise correction, the SNR improvement is achieved at least 10dB at SNR 5dB, and most of the improvement SNR are better than other methods at least 1dB at different SNR. To apply presented algorithms for the portable ECG device, all R peaks can be detected no matter when people walk, run or move at the speed below 9km/hr.","doi":"10.1109/HealthCom.2013.6720700","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 15th International Conference on e-Health Networking, Applications and Services (Healthcom 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 15th International Conference on e-Health Networking, Applications and Services (Healthcom 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6713381/6720623/06720700.pdf","startPage":"355","endPage":"360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HealthCom.2013.6720700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6720623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete-wavelet-transform-based noise reduction and R wave detection for ECG signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6720700","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6720700/","displayDocTitle":"Discrete-wavelet-transform-based noise reduction and R wave detection for ECG signals","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14060953","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6720700/","conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete-wavelet-transform-based noise reduction and R wave detection for ECG signals","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"p355lin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076039S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6713381","isNumber":"6720623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713381","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6720623","articleId":"6720700","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6720703,"authors":[{"name":"Nabiul Islam","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Nabiul","lastName":"Islam","id":"38498557200"},{"name":"Sudip Misra","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Sudip","lastName":"Misra","id":"37085439739"},{"name":"Judhistir Mahapatro","affiliation":["School of Medical Science & Technology, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Judhistir","lastName":"Mahapatro","id":"38504966200"},{"name":"Joel J.P.C.

In this paper, we address the issue of catastrophic collision - a phenomenon which exhibits recurrent collisions of femtosecond-long pulse symbols emanating from the nanodevices in a WB2N. Such type of collision is very serious in these networks due to unique properties of the terahertz band (0.1-10 THz). The existing sate-of-the-art on the issue of coordination for medium access by nano-devices is based on asynchronous exchange of pulses by assigning different symbol rates. The existing method of choosing the symbol rate does not completely avoid catastrophic collision. The severity of collision is further pronounced when molecular absorption noise gets compounded. In essence, a few number of collisions, in turn, invites huge number of such events for the subsequent transmission and eventually degrades the whole network performance. So, it is important to handle such collisions for successful execution of protocols of the higher layers. In present work, we analyze the catastrophic collision in detail and model the collision. The preliminary results exhibit the severity of such collisions in the network.

Previous research shows that cataract occupies almost 50% in severe visually impairments. Considering the fact that retinal image is one of the most important medical references that help to diagnose the cataract, this paper proposes to use a neural network classifier for automatic cataract detection based on the classification of retinal images. The classifier building procedure includes three parts: preprocessing, feature extraction, and classifier construction. In the pre-processing part, an improved Top-bottom hat transformation is proposed to enhance the contrast between the foreground and the object, and a trilateral filter is used to decrease the noise in the image. According to the analysis of pre-processed image, the luminance and texture message of the image are extracted as classification features.

To reduce power consumption, approximate implementations of a circuit have been considered as a potential solution for applications in which strict exactness is not required. In inexact computing, power reduction is achieved through the relaxation of the often demanding requirement of accuracy. In this paper, new approximate adders are proposed for low-power imprecise applications. These adders are based on XOR/XNOR gates with multiplexers implemented by pass transistors. The proposed approximate XOR/XNOR-based adders (AXAs) are evaluated and compared with respect to energy consumption, delay, area and power delay product (PDP) with an accurate full adder. The metric of error distance is used to evaluate the reliability of the approximate designs. Simulation by Cadence's Spectre in TSMC 65nm process has shown that the proposed designs consume less power and have better performance (such as a lower propagation delay) compared to the accurate XOR/XNOR-based adder, while the error distance remains similar or better than other approximate adder designs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6720793/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14060516","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6720793/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Approximate XOR/XNOR-based adders for inexact computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate XOR/XNOR-based adders for inexact computing","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078079S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6712173","isNumber":"6720785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6712173","citationCount":"125","xplore-issue":"6720785","articleId":"6720793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6720800,"authors":[{"name":"Pilin Junsangsri","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Pilin","lastName":"Junsangsri","id":"37541357400"},{"name":"Jie Han","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Han","id":"37556260600"},{"name":"Fabrizio Lombardi","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Lombardi","id":"37279999000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0676-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0675-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1944-9399"}],"articleNumber":"6720800","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6720800","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase change materials","Resistance","Threshold voltage","Integrated circuit modeling","Programming","Switching circuits","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit modelling","phase change memories","sensitivity analysis","SPICE"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["drift behaviors","phase change memory cell","PCM cell","HSPICE macromodel","threshold voltage","amorphous phase","crystalline phase","electrical based modeling","PCM resistance","programming time","I-V plot","R-I plot","sensitivity analysis","electrical parameters"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a HSPICE macromodel of a phase change memory (PCM) by considering the phenomenon of drift behavior as leading to incorrect operation.

However, the STT switching mechanism of MTJ has been revealed intrinsically stochastic, which results from the unavoidable thermal fluctuations of magnetization. This phenomenon affects deeply the reliability of hybrid CMOS/MTJ interface circuits and drives important power overhead. In this paper, we present a multilevel cell (MLC) STT-MRAM benefiting from the stochastic behaviors. It allows not only higher storage density, but also reduces the programming power and delay.

paper presents a novel technique for long survival observation of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) inside Environmental-SEM (E-SEM) for nanomanipulations. We have developed the nanorobotic manipulation system inside an Environmental-Scanning Electron Microscope (E-SEM) integrated optical microscope (OM) for nanobiomanipulation platform. Our platform provides a real-time high resolution image under water-contained condition in nano-meter high-magnification image. One of the difficulties on the E-SEM observation is to maintain the biological sample on survival condition in long time. In this paper, we propose a coating method on the C. elegans or sample substrate for maintain the survival condition to keep in wet-condition. The proposed technique is useful to operate the nanomanipulation on C. elegans body, for example nano-injection of functional micro-nano beads as demonstrated in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/NANO.2013.6721021","publicationTitle":"2013 13th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE-NANO 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 13th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE-NANO 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6712173/6720785/06721021.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANO.2013.6721021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6720785","startPage":"187","endPage":"190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Long survival observation of C. elegans inside Environmental SEM for nanomanipulations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6721021","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Long survival observation of C. elegans inside Environmental SEM for nanomanipulations","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6721021/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14060394","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6721021/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long survival observation of C. elegans inside Environmental SEM for nanomanipulations","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077686S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6712173","isNumber":"6720785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6712173","xplore-issue":"6720785","articleId":"6721021","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6721030,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Jin","affiliation":["Division of IT Convergence Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Jin","id":"37085581364"},{"name":"Jungsik Kim","affiliation":["Division of IT Convergence Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), 790-784, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jungsik","lastName":"Kim"},{"name":"Daegun Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Daegun","lastName":"Kang","id":"37086758809"},{"name":"M.

The system-level simulations show that such a system can solve a complex real-life video processing problem (vehicle counting) with high recognition rate (>94%) and low power consumption. The impact of the resistance window on the power consumption of the system is also studied. Results show that the learning-mode power consumption can be dramatically reduced if the RESET state of the PCM devices is tuned to a relatively low resistance. Read-mode power consumption, on the other hand, can be minimized by increasing the resistance values for both SET and RESET states of the PCM devices.","doi":"10.1109/NANO.2013.6721057","publicationTitle":"2013 13th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE-NANO 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 13th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE-NANO 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6712173/6720785/06721057.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANO.2013.6721057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6720785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic neuromorphic system using binary phase-change memory (PCM) synapses: Detailed power consumption analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6721057/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic neuromorphic system using binary phase-change memory (PCM) synapses: Detailed power consumption analysis","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14060554","htmlLink":"/document/6721057/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic neuromorphic system using binary phase-change memory (PCM) synapses: Detailed power consumption analysis","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0400.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116587S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6712173","isNumber":"6720785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6712173","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6720785","articleId":"6721057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6721059,"authors":[{"name":"Guangyong Li","affiliation":["MEMS and Nanotechnology Laboratory, School of Mechanical Engineering, Gwangju, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Guangyong","lastName":"Li","id":"37086727657"},{"name":"Mitesh Parmar","affiliation":["MEMS and Nanotechnology Laboratory, School of Mechanical Engineering, Gwangju, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Mitesh","lastName":"Parmar","id":"37086633260"},{"name":"Dong-weon Lee","affiliation":["MEMS and Nanotechnology Laboratory, School of Mechanical Engineering, Gwangju, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-weon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086726127"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0676-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0675-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1944-9399"}],"articleNumber":"6721059","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"abstract":"In this paper, a gas permeable PDMS (polydimethlysiloxane) based microfluidic device has been reported for surface modification of oxidized Galinstan.

The PDMS wall thickness was optimized after studying the recovery of non-wetting characteristics of HCl treated Galinstan droplet and HCl permeability through different thickness of PDMS films. The novel microfuidic device was fabricated using conventional micro-molding technology.

This key feature may be of great impact not only for hazard monitoring and risk mitigation activities but also for data sharing and knowledge spreading within the scientific community.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SBAS-DInSAR time series generation on cloud computing platforms","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6721145","startPage":"274","endPage":"277","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6721145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721065","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium - IGARSS","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium - IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/6704876/6721065/06721145.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6721145","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6721145/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-26 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"SBAS-DInSAR time series generation on cloud computing platforms","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6721145/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14059191","conferenceDate":"21-26 July 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SBAS-DInSAR time series generation on cloud computing platforms","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"0000274.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061167S","chronDate":"21-26 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6704876","isNumber":"6721065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6704876","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6721065","articleId":"6721145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6721178,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohua Zhou","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Space Technology, Xi'an Institute of Space Radio Technology, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohua","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086657062"},{"name":"Yu Guo","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Space Technology, Xi'an Institute of Space Radio Technology, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Guo","id":"37086656908"},{"name":"Hao Li","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Space Technology, Xi'an Institute of Space Radio Technology, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Li","id":"37086652852"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1114-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"6721178","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Satellites","Remote sensing","Testing","Microwave circuits","Microwave radiometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial satellites","field programmable gate arrays","microwave detectors","radiometers","remote sensing","system buses","test equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA design","ground testing equipment bus interface conversion circuit","microwave remote sensor","FY-3 satellite","HY-2 satellite","microwave radiometer","microwave scattermeter","MCU technology","DDS technology","RS485 interface","RS422 interface","RS232 interface","LVDS bus interface conversion function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microwave remote sensor","Ground testing equipment","Bus interface","FPGA design"]}],"abstract":"The ground testing equipment is essential debugging and testing equipment for microwave remote sensor on satellite.

Current TES methods were proposed and succeeded to apply for the retrieval of land surface temperature and emissivity for the materials with emissivity close to 1. This work addressed the performance of linear spectral emissivity constraint (LSEC) method proposed by wang et al. (2011) for the TES of hyperspectral TIR data for contrast samples (high- and low- emissivity materials). The simulated hyperspectral TIR data are used for analysis and generated with six MODTRAN standard atmospheric profiles by hyperspectral atmospheric radiative transfer model (4A/OP). The influence of initial emissivity estimation is considered in this paper. The results show that initial emissivity estimation has a great impact on the performance of LSEC. LSEC method performs a fairly good result when the initial emissivity is close to the true value, and the RMSEs of temperature and emissivity are smaller than 0.5K and 0.01 when initial emissivity is good. However, the performance is worst when the initial emissivity has a great deviation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Atmospheric modeling","Materials","Land surface","Land surface temperature","Hyperspectral imaging","Atmospheric measurements","Temperature sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric boundary layer","atmospheric techniques","emissivity","hyperspectral imaging","infrared imaging","land surface temperature","radiative transfer","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperspectral thermal infrared data","temperature-emissivity separation method","TES method","land surface temperature retrieval","land surface emissivity retrieval","linear spectral emissivity constraint","LSEC method","hyperspectral TIR data","high emissivity materials","low emissivity materials","MODTRAN standard atmospheric profiles","4A/OP hyperspectral atmospheric radiative transfer model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["low emissivity","Land surface temperature","Hyperspectral thermal infrared","LSEC method"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6721193","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium - IGARSS","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium - IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/6704876/6721065/06721193.pdf","startPage":"465","endPage":"468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6721193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Preliminary evaluation of linear spectral emissivity constraint temperature and emissivity separation method for contrast samples from hyperspectral thermal infrared data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6721193","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Preliminary evaluation of linear spectral emissivity constraint temperature and emissivity separation method for contrast samples from hyperspectral thermal infrared data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6721193/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6721193/","accessionNumber":"14058957","conferenceDate":"21-26 July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-26 July 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preliminary evaluation of linear spectral emissivity constraint temperature and emissivity separation method for contrast samples from hyperspectral thermal infrared data","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"0000465.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050002S","chronDate":"21-26 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6704876","isNumber":"6721065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6704876","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6721065","articleId":"6721193","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6721236,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Xiao","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, BeiHang Univercity, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37085505281"},{"name":"Ze Yu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, BeiHang Univercity, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ze","lastName":"Yu","id":"37290408000"},{"name":"Chunsheng Li","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, BeiHang Univercity, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chunsheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37291258900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1114-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"6721236","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"abstract":"A novel SAR imaging approach has been exposed in this paper.

The proposed model is solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM); we enhance the spatial smoothness by expanding the spatial information from the fixed labeled samples to the whole data to further improve the classification accuracy.

In this paper, we propose a noise reduction method for HSI based on non-local strategy and tensor factorization. Based on the observation that natural images are always locally self-repetitive, we divide the whole HSI into small sub-blocks and cluster similar blocks into groups. Since similar blocks share the same underlying structure, the redundancy can be utilized to remove noise of the blocks jointly. We stack the similar blocks to construct a fourth-order tensor from each group. Noise is reduced by finding the lower dimensional approximation of each of the fourth-order tensors via Tucker factorization. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method has a good quality of restoring the true signal from the noisy observation.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6721352","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium - IGARSS","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium - IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/6704876/6721065/06721352.pdf","startPage":"1083","endPage":"1086","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6721352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise reduction of hyperspectral imagery based on nonlocal tensor factorization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6721352","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-26 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6721352/","displayDocTitle":"Noise reduction of hyperspectral imagery based on nonlocal tensor factorization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14059313","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6721352/","conferenceDate":"21-26 July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise reduction of hyperspectral imagery based on nonlocal tensor factorization","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"0001083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04937S","chronDate":"21-26 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6704876","isNumber":"6721065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6704876","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6721065","articleId":"6721352","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6721353,"authors":[{"name":"Alp Ert\u00fcrk","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecom.

Most of the endmember extraction methods in the literature use only the spectral information, whereas the spatial composition of the data is disregarded. Spatial preprocessing methods, that are motivated by the assumption that endmembers are more likely to be located in homogeneous regions instead of transition areas, can alleviate this drawback and hence increase the performance. However, such a preprocessing approach generally results in a failure of extracting anomalous endmembers which can be of importance for many applications.

Neural Networks have shown great promise in fitting these large-scale simulations even without performing factor screening. However, factor screening is an effective method for logically reducing the dimensionality of an input space and thus enabling more feasible metamodel calibration. Applying factor screening methods before calibrating Neural Network metamodels or any metamodel can have both positive and negative effects. The critical assumption for factor screening under investigation involves the prevalence of two-way interactions that contain a variable without a significant main effect by itself. In a simulation with a large parameter space, the prevalence of two-way interactions and their contribution to the total variability in the model output is far from transparent. Important questions therefore arise regarding factor screening and Neural Network metamodels: (a) is this a process worth doing with today's more powerful computing processors, which provide a larger library of runs to do metamodeling; and (b), does erroneously screening these buried interaction terms critically impact the level of metamodel fidelity that one can achieve. In this paper we examine these questions through the construction of a case study on a large-scale simulation. This study projects regional homelessness levels per county of interest based on a large array of budget decisions and resource allocations that expand out to hundreds of input parameters.","doi":"10.1109/WSC.2013.6721444","pdfPath":"/iel7/6709837/6721384/06721444.pdf","startPage":"486","endPage":"496","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Winter Simulations Conference (WSC)","publicationTitle":"2013 Winter Simulations Conference (WSC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSC.2013.6721444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A case study examining the impact of factor screening for Neural Network metamodels","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6721444/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A case study examining the impact of factor screening for Neural Network metamodels","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14060122","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6721444/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A case study examining the impact of factor screening for Neural Network metamodels","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082416S","chronDate":"8-11 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6709837","isNumber":"6721384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6709837","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6721384","articleId":"6721444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6721494,"authors":[{"name":"Alejandro Llorente","affiliation":["Instituto de Ingenier\u00eda del Conocimiento, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid, Madrid, SPAIN"],"bio":{"p":["ALEJANDRO LLORENTE is a Ph.D. student at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid and also holds a position as researcher at Instituto de Ingeniera del Conocimiento in Madrid (Spain).

An analysis based on the Random Energy Model (REM), a simplified model used to describe the thermodynamic properties of amorphous solids, shows that, in a specific limit, a second order phase transition takes place: For small sample sizes the typical and average values of the estimator are very different. For sufficiently large samples, the most probable value of the estimator is close to its expected value.

Lightweight online on-mote processing may improve the usage of their limited resources, such as energy, by transmitting only unexpected sensor data (anomalies). We detect anomalies by analyzing sensor reading predictions from a linear model. We use Recursive Least Squares (RLS) to estimate the model parameters, because for large datasets the standard Linear Least Squares Estimation (LLSE) is not resource friendly. We evaluate the use of fixed-point RLS with adaptive thresholding, and its application to anomaly detection in embedded systems. We present an extensive experimental campaign on generated and real-world datasets, with floating-point RLS, LLSE, and a rule-based method as benchmarks. The methods are evaluated on prediction accuracy of the models, and on detection of anomalies, which are injected in the generated dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is comparable, in terms of prediction accuracy and detection performance, to the other LS methods. However, fixed-point RLS is efficiently implement able in embedded devices. The presented method enables online on-mote anomaly detection with results comparable to offline LS methods.","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2013.9","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689802/6721750/06721762.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"13","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection in Sensor Systems Using Lightweight Machine Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6721762","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6721762/","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection in Sensor Systems Using Lightweight Machine Learning","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14000820","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6721762/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection in Sensor Systems Using Lightweight Machine Learning","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652a007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063839S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6721762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6721788,"authors":[{"name":"Tan-Hsu Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"firstName":"Tan-Hsu","lastName":"Tan","id":"37086643925"},{"name":"Cheng-Chun Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"firstName":"Cheng-Chun","lastName":"Chang","id":"37896408400"},{"name":"Fu-Rong Jean","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"firstName":"Fu-Rong","lastName":"Jean","id":"37347389200"},{"name":"John Y.

Experimental result demonstrates that the proposed SAM-GA scheme achieves the best performance in terms of mean squared error (MSE) and bit error rate (BER) for joint channel estimation and multi-user detection in the OFDMA system as compared to other existing schemes.","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2013.35","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689802/6721750/06721788.pdf","startPage":"162","endPage":"167","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Channel Estimation and Multi-user Detection for OFDMA Systems Using a Genetic Algorithm with Simulated Annealing-Based Mutation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6721788","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6721788/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Channel Estimation and Multi-user Detection for OFDMA Systems Using a Genetic Algorithm with Simulated Annealing-Based Mutation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14000840","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6721788/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Channel Estimation and Multi-user Detection for OFDMA Systems Using a Genetic Algorithm with Simulated Annealing-Based Mutation","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652a162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064979S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6721788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6721789,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Rong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chao-Rong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37423344900"},{"name":"Yi-Cheng Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Cheng","lastName":"Chang","id":"37086765930"},{"name":"Chi-Chen Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Chen","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086665376"},{"name":"Ying-Yi Hong","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Chung-Yuan Christian University, Chung-Li City, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ying-Yi","lastName":"Hong","id":"37276994700"},{"name":"Faa-Jeng Lin","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Chung-Li City, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Faa-Jeng","lastName":"Lin","id":"37272521300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0652-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6721789","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reactive power","Biological cells","Capacitors","Generators","Genetic algorithms","Switches","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","power generation dispatch","power generation scheduling","reactive power control","search problems","Taguchi methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergent stability","shunt reactor","shunt capacitor","tap changing transformer setting","power generator voltage magnitude","active power loss","reactive power scheduling","signal-to-noise ratio data","orthogonal array","global search function","reactive power dispatch scheduling","HTGA","hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm","reactive power controller","short-term scheduling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["reactive power scheduling","genetic algorithm","Taguchi method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6721789","abstract":"The paper proposes an application of Hybrid Taguchi-Genetic Algorithm (HTGA) on short-term reactive power dispatch scheduling.

In the original MTSP, a city can be visited by any traveling salesman and is thus renamed as an ordinary one in MTSP. A new class of cities is introduced in MTSP, called exclusive ones. They are divided into groups, each of which can be exclusively visited by a specified or predetermined salesman. To solve MTSP, a genetic algorithm is presented. It encodes cities and salesman into two single chromosomes. Accordingly, three modes of crossover and mutation operators are designed, i.e., simple city crossover and mutation (CCM), simple salesman crossover and mutation, and mixed city-salesman crossover and mutation. All the operations of crossover and mutation follow the proper relationship between cities and salesman. With the help of an MTSP example, the performance of the proposed algorithm with three modes of crossover and mutation operators is compared and analyzed. The simulation results show that the algorithm can solve MTSP with rapid convergence with CCM being the best mode of the operators.","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2013.112","startPage":"627","endPage":"632","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689802/6721750/06721865.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem and Its Genetic Algorithm-Based Solution","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cities and towns","Biological cells","Genetic algorithms","Traveling salesman problems","Convergence","Educational institutions","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","travelling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mixed city-salesman crossover and mutation","simple salesman crossover and mutation","CCM","simple city crossover and mutation","single chromosomes","exclusive cities","ordinary cities","MTSP","genetic algorithm-based solution","multiple traveling salesman problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem","Genetic Algorithm","optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6721865/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A New Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem and Its Genetic Algorithm-Based Solution","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6721865/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14000929","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem and Its Genetic Algorithm-Based Solution","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652a627.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053718S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6721865","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6721899,"authors":[{"name":"Zhichao Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University"],"firstName":"Zhichao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37985097300"},{"name":"Shaoqiu Zheng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shaoqiu","lastName":"Zheng","id":"38529151900"},{"name":"Weiping Li","affiliation":["School of Software and Microelectronics, Peking University"],"firstName":"Weiping","lastName":"Li","id":"37537046800"},{"name":"Ying Tan","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception (Ministry of Education), Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Tan","id":"37274878900"},{"name":"Zhonghai Wu","affiliation":["School of Software and Microelectronics, Peking University"],"firstName":"Zhonghai","lastName":"Wu","id":"37856575700"},{"name":"Wei Tan","affiliation":["IBM T.

In this paper, we propose a GA(Genetic Algorithm) based novel service composition method in a context-aware environment. We first use Context Space model to represent context, situation, user preference and services in a unified formal way. Then we transform the service composition problem into a multi-objective optimization problem and utilize GA to find the optimal service composition based on user's preference. To affiliate the connection between context and services, we use a vector to represent each service to reflect which context types a service can change so as to utilize GA to find the best service composition. Confliction of services may happen during the GA process. In order to resolve the conflicts, we propose a SST(Service Similarity Tree) method to measure the similarity among services to find out the best alternative. Finally, we design and implement a simulation experiment to verify our method. The results shows that our method can leverage GA to synthesis appropriate services to achieve user desired goal in an efficient way.","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2013.147","startPage":"829","endPage":"834","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689802/6721750/06721899.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leveraging Genetic Algorithm to Compose Web Services in a Context-Aware Environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Context","Genetic algorithms","Context modeling","Web services","Biological cells","Genetics","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","trees (mathematics)","ubiquitous computing","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["service similarity measurement","service similarity tree method","SST method","service conflict","optimal service composition","multiobjective optimization problem","service representation","user preference representation","situation representation","context representation","context space model","service composition method","service discovery","adaption mechanism","context-aware pervasive environment","Web service composition","genetic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Web Services","Context aware","Genetic Algorithm","Service Similarity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6721899/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Leveraging Genetic Algorithm to Compose Web Services in a Context-Aware Environment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6721899/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14067019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leveraging Genetic Algorithm to Compose Web Services in a Context-Aware Environment","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652a829.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109181S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6721899","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6721911,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriel E.

In the framework, each robot does not achieve just a single task based on initially set program, but performs several tasks depending on programs introduced by mobile software agents from outside. Since the mobile software agents can migrate to arbitrary robots by wireless communication networks, they can find the most suitably equipped and/or the most suitably located robots to perform their task. Using the mobility of the agents, we have proposed several approaches suppressing the total energy consumption of the multiple robots without sacrificing their efficiency. In these approaches, the target robots in the migration of software agents are restricted to those within the view of the camera of the source robot. Because it is necessary to identify the location and the IP address of the robots to migrate, and therefore, all the approaches are restricted by a condition that the source robot has to have a clear view without any obstacles so that the robot can see the target robots. In this paper, we propose a simple manner for controlling multiple robots in a three-dimensional environment by including aerial robots. The aerial robots provide bird's-eyes to the robots on the ground. Furthermore, since the aerial robot hovers over the ground robot on which a software agent resides, the movement of the aerial robot is achieved by traversing ground robots following the agent. The controlling manner contributes to making it easy to control multiple robots with the aerial robots through reducing three-dimensional control environment to two-dimensional one. We have implemented the basic behaviors in the three-dimensional model. We show prospects and problems of our model through their experimental results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot kinematics","Cameras","Robot vision systems","Mobile agents","Control

a time-consuming and subjective process. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of histopathology images has become an important research area in diagnostic pathology. This paper presents a scheme to improve the accuracy of existing CAD systems for Gleason grading on digital biopsy slides by combining color and multi-scale information using quaternion algebra. The distinguishing features of presented algorithm are: 1) use of the quaternion wavelet transform and modified local binary patterns for the analysis of image texture in regions of interest, 2) A two-stage classification method: (a) a quaternion neural network with a new high-speed learning algorithm used for multiclass classification, and (b) several binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers used for classification refinement. In order to evaluate performance, hold-one-out cross validation is applied to a data set of 71 images of prostatic carcinomas belonging to Gleason grades 3, 4 and 5. The developed system assigns the correct Gleason grade in 98.87% of test cases and outperforms other published automatic Gleason grading systems. Moreover, averaged over all the classes, testing of the proposed method shows a specificity rate of 0.990 and a sensitivity rate of 0.967. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed scheme can help pathologists and radiologists diagnose prostate cancer more efficiently and with better reproducability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6721952/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14067255","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6721952/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Quaternion Neural Networks Applied to Prostate Cancer Gleason Grading","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quaternion Neural Networks Applied to Prostate Cancer Gleason Grading","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652b144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103136S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6721952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6721979,"authors":[{"name":"Niyazi Sorkunlu","affiliation":["Electrical and Microelectronic Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Niyazi","lastName":"Sorkunlu","id":"37086056990"},{"name":"Ugur Sahin","affiliation":["Electrical and Microelectronic Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Ugur","lastName":"Sahin","id":"38529360600"},{"name":"Ferat Sahin","affiliation":["Electrical and Microelectronic Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Ferat","lastName":"Sahin","id":"37396486100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0652-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6721979","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":302},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block Matching with Particle Swarm Optimization for Motion Estimation","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689802/6721750/06721979.pdf","startPage":"1306","endPage":"1311","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721750","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2013.226","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Particle swarm optimization","Image sequences","Vectors","Streaming media","PSNR","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image matching","image sequences","minimisation","motion estimation","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion vectors","heuristic algorithm","minimization algorithm","image sequence","PSO","block matching","block based motion estimation algorithms","particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization","Digital Video Processing","Block Matching"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6721979","abstract":"Block matching algorithms successfully reduce the computational load of the motion estimation.

Finding the moving block in the image sequence requires a minimization algorithm. Using particle swarm optimization, the computational cost of the block matching is aimed to decrease.

The dynamics of particles is governed by a deterministic difference equation on a discrete search space. It is convenient from viewpoints of reproducibility and implementation. The inter-particle collision is controlled by a simple mechanics-like rule. The collision can be effective to enlarge diversity of particles and to avoid trapping into partial/local solutions. The optimizer is applied to an example of a simple discrete multi-solution problem whose solutions corresponds to periodic points of a typical nonlinear dynamical system. This problem can be a first step to a novel application to analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems. The performance of the optimizer is investigated based on three feature quantities: success rate to find all the solutions, the number of iterations to find the solutions and the number of collisions in the search process. The results can provide basic information to develop an efficient algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6721984/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14067622","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6721984/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Deterministic Particle Swarm Optimizers with Collision for Discrete Multi-solution Problems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deterministic Particle Swarm Optimizers with Collision for Discrete Multi-solution Problems","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652b335.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.134768S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6721984","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6721993,"authors":[{"name":"Andranik S.

The algorithm based on the dynamical interaction of synchronized agents which are interdepended genetic algorithms (GAs) having own separate evolutions of their populations. This approach has some similarities with well known \"island model\" of GA. In both methods is used a migration of individuals from agents (\"islands\") to the main process (\"continent\"). In contrast, the intelligent agents in MAGAMO are able to decompose the dimensions space to form evolutions of subpopulations (instead of distribution of initial population as in the standard \"island model\"). In the same time, the main (central) process is responsible for the coordination of agents only and their selection according Pareto rules (without evolution). Intelligent agents seek local sub optimal solutions for a global optimization, which will be completed in the result of the interaction of all agents. In the result of this, the amount of needed recalculating the fitness-functions can be significantly reduced. It is especially important for the multi-objective optimization related to a large-scale problem. Besides, the proposed approximating approach allows solving complex optimization problems for real big systems (like an oil company, plants, corporations, etc.).","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2013.240","startPage":"1391","endPage":"1395","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689802/6721750/06721993.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi-agent Genetic Algorithm for Multi-objective Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Genetic algorithms","Analytical models","Computational modeling","Evolutionary computation","Estimation","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","multi-agent systems","Pareto optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["big systems","complex optimization problems","large-scale problem","fitness-functions","global optimization","local suboptimal solutions","Pareto rules","subpopulations","MAGAMO","intelligent agents","island model","interdepended genetic algorithms","synchronized agents dynamical interaction","multiagent genetic algorithm for multiobjective optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["genetic algorithms","multi-objective optimization","multi-agent systems","large-scale problem","Pareto-front","simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6721993/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Multi-agent Genetic Algorithm for Multi-objective Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6721993/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14067050","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multi-agent Genetic Algorithm for Multi-objective Optimization","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652b391.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065102S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6721993","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6721998,"authors":[{"name":"Quirino Zagarese","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Sannio, Benevento, ITALY"],"firstName":"Quirino","lastName":"Zagarese","id":"38233554400"},{"name":"Angelo Furno","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Sannio, Benevento, ITALY"],"firstName":"Angelo","lastName":"Furno","id":"38229625800"},{"name":"Gerardo Canfora","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Sannio, Benevento, ITALY"],"firstName":"Gerardo","lastName":"Canfora","id":"37272039700"},{"name":"Eugenio Zimeo","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Sannio, Benevento, ITALY"],"firstName":"Eugenio","lastName":"Zimeo","id":"37266070000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0652-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6721998","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Middleware","Programming","Context","Business","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Data transfer","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","file organisation","middleware","service-oriented architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["effective event-driven SOA","enterprise systems","D-WSLink framework","data transfers","composite declarative mechanism","message transfer","middleware","conditional lazy transfer mechanisms","Apache Camel","event-driven programming","service oriented architecture","extensible declarative mechanism"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SOA","EDA","Enterprise Systems","Data-Intensive","Publish-Subscribe"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Effective Event-Driven SOA in Enterprise Systems","abstract":"Event-driven programming is progressively replacing the call-stack model to improve flexibility, efficiency and scalability in SOA. Enterprise applications often deal with large messages attached to asynchronous events. This could reduce the benefits provided by event-driven programming since the need for having every information propagated as event is counterbalanced by wasting resources when large messages are entirely propagated to destinations that do not use all of them. In this paper, we propose the adoption of the D-WSLink framework for improving data transfers by using a composite and extensible declarative mechanism to inject the desired message transfer strategies into the underlying middleware. At the current stage, we focus mainly on (conditional) lazy transfer mechanisms even though the framework is able to support also smarter strategies. In particular, we compare, through an experimental analysis, our system with Apache Camel in delivering events with large attachments. The results show that the proposed approach is effective not only for programming but also at performance level.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6721998","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689802/6721750/06721998.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721750","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.245","startPage":"1419","endPage":"1424","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2013.245","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6721998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Towards Effective Event-Driven SOA in Enterprise Systems","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6721998/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14067458","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Effective Event-Driven SOA in Enterprise Systems","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652b419.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071102S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6721998","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6722005,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Rong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chao-Rong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086670290"},{"name":"Ming-Jen Lan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Jen","lastName":"Lan","id":"37086670055"},{"name":"Chi-Chen Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Chen","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086665376"},{"name":"Ying-Yi Hong","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Chung-Yuan Christian University, Chung-Li City, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ying-Yi","lastName":"Hong","id":"37276994700"},{"name":"Steven H.

The demand response is mainly through electricity price publicized by utility company to guide customers in electricity scheduling, and by use of price negotiating mechanism, to reach mutual benefits for both sides of demand and supply. The paper proposes a method of minimizing tariff for customers through changing elastic load use time intervals where customers' electricity use time is divided into inelastic and elastic intervals by electricity use characteristics. In the paper, customer's one day electricity used is assumed to conduct simulation, by genetic algorithm, comparing variations among scheduling and tariff under different electricity use limitation situations. As shown in the results, it is found that through elastic load use time interval changes, minimum tariff objective can be reached, and feasibility of the proposed method is verified.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722005/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14067686","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6722005/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Demand Response Optimization for Smart Home Scheduling Using Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demand Response Optimization for Smart Home Scheduling Using Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652b461.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059797S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6722005","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6722027,"authors":[{"name":"Andres Jess\u00e9 Porfirio","affiliation":["Department of Informatic, Federal University of Parana, Curitiba, Brazil"],"firstName":"Andres Jess\u00e9","lastName":"Porfirio","id":"37086740034"},{"name":"Kelly La\u00eds Wiggers","affiliation":["Universidade Estadual do Centro Oeste, Guarapuava, Brazil"],"firstName":"Kelly La\u00eds","lastName":"Wiggers","id":"37086479703"},{"name":"Luiz E.S.

SVM classification was also performed on a database composed of 610 image pairs using 2D horizontal and vertical projections as features, resulting in Rank1 = 88.69% and Rank3 = 98.36%.

In order to assist nursing-care experts in evaluating the nursing-care texts, a computer aided nursing-care text classification system has been developed. In this paper, we propose a phrase based feature vector definition for classifying the nursing-care texts. The dependency relation based feature vector definition has been proposed in our previous work. As another feature vector definition method, we propose a phrase based feature vector definition method. Phrases are found by using the dependency relation analysis and stored into a phrase list. We also define a similarity between phrases because each phrase consists of some kinds of words.

The first collision avoidance method is based on a geometric approach which computes a direction of avoidance from the flight direction and simple geometric equations. The second technique uses virtual repulsive force fields causing the UAV to be repelled by obstacles. The last method is a grid-based online path re-planning algorithm with A* search that finds a collision free path during flight. Various flight scenarios were defined including static and dynamic obstacles.","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2013.338","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689802/6721750/06722091.pdf","startPage":"1969","endPage":"1974","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparative Study of Collision Avoidance Techniques for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722091/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Comparative Study of Collision Avoidance Techniques for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6722091/","accessionNumber":"14067497","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparative Study of Collision Avoidance Techniques for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652b969.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070413S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6722091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6722095,"authors":[{"name":"Kuniaki Noda","affiliation":["Graduate School of Fundamental Science and Engineering Waseda University, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kuniaki","lastName":"Noda","id":"38022280000"},{"name":"Hiroaki Arie","affiliation":["Graduate School of Fundamental Science and Engineering Waseda University, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroaki","lastName":"Arie","id":"37426879900"},{"name":"Yuki Suga","affiliation":["Graduate School of Fundamental Science and Engineering Waseda University, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuki","lastName":"Suga","id":"37273974700"},{"name":"Testuya Ogata","affiliation":["Graduate School of Fundamental Science and Engineering Waseda University, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Testuya","lastName":"Ogata","id":"37273829100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0652-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6722095","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":205},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Image retrieval","Joints","Image color analysis","Neural networks","Robot sensing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bells","causality","hearing","humanoid robots","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensory-motor sequence","causal dependencies","sound motion","bell ring motion","visual sequence generation","cross-modal memory retrieval function","humanoid robot","bell ring task","deep learning framework","deep neural networks","intersensory causality modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep learning","multimodal integration","temporal sequence learning","robotics"]}],"abstract":"Our brain is known to enhance perceptual precision and reduce ambiguity about sensory environment by integrating multiple sources of sensory information acquired from different modalities, such as vision, auditory and somatic sensation.

In this study, we propose such a model based on a deep learning framework and we evaluate the proposed model by conducting a bell ring task using a small humanoid robot.

Sample set or number of measurements were reduced in order to achieve rapid imaging. However, due to inadequate sampling, noise artefacts are inevitable in Compressive Sensing (CS) MRI. CS utilizes the transform sparsity of MR images to regenerate images from under-sampled data. Locally sparsified Compressed Sensing is an extension of simple CS. It localises sparsity constraints for sub-regions rather than using a global constraint. This paper, presents a framework to use local CS for improving image quality without increasing sampling rate or without making the acquisition process any slower. This was achieved by exploiting local constraints. Localising image into independent sub-regions allows different sampling rates within image. Energy distribution of MR images is not even and most of noise occurs due to under-sampling in high energy regions. By sampling sub-regions based on energy distribution, noise artefacts can be minimized. Experiments were done using the proposed technique. Results were compared with global CS and summarized in this paper.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Locally Sparsified Compressive Sensing for Improved MR Image Quality","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2013.370","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689802/6721750/06722123.pdf","startPage":"2163","endPage":"2167","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721750","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6722123","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722123/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Locally Sparsified Compressive Sensing for Improved MR Image Quality","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6722123/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14067119","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Locally Sparsified Compressive Sensing for Improved MR Image Quality","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652c163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055204S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6722123","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6722124,"authors":[{"name":"Lakshmi Devan","affiliation":["Sathyabama University, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India"],"firstName":"Lakshmi","lastName":"Devan","id":"37086743240"},{"name":"Roy Santhosham","affiliation":["Santosham Chest Hospital, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India"],"firstName":"Roy","lastName":"Santhosham","id":"38547216900"},{"name":"Ranganathan Hariharan","affiliation":["Rajiv Gandhi College of Engineering, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India"],"firstName":"Ranganathan","lastName":"Hariharan","id":"37086742061"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0652-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6722124","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lungs","Computed tomography","Cancer","Feature extraction","Diseases","Training","Entropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancer","computerised tomography","image classification","lung","medical image processing","neural nets","patient diagnosis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GLCM","gray level run length matrix","GLRLM","gray level cooccurrence matrix","ROC","receiver operating characteristics curve","NN classifier","lung abnormalities","ROI","region of interest","radiologist workload reduction","CAD","computer aided diagnosis","CT-guided biopsy","bronchoscopy","biopsy","inflammatory fibrosis","radiological picture","lung cancer patients","radiological similarities","TB prevalence","diseases","tuberculosis","low-dose lung CT images","carcinoma characterization","fibrosis characterization","noninvasive method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer Aided Diagnosis","Image Processing","Neural Network"]}],"abstract":"The diagnosis of tuberculosis and lung cancer can be difficult, as symptoms of both diseases are similar. Due to high TB prevalence and radiological similarities, a large number of lung cancer patients initially get wrongly treated for tuberculosis based on radiological picture alone. However, treating TB leads to inflammatory fibrosis in some of the patients. In all these cases, the diagnosis is confirmed only with a biopsy which is an invasive technique that is usually performed via Bronchoscopy or CT - guided biopsy. There comes the need of an efficient Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD) of the fibrosis and adenocarcinoma diseases. The increased chance of characterizing tissues with the help of CAD and the achievable workload reduction for the radiologist demand the usage of these systems in CT screenings as well as daily hospital practice. Generally, the CAD is designed based on the Region of Interest(ROI) given by the radiologist which makes the system semi-automatic. Our work presents a fully automated method of characterization of carcinoma from other lung abnormalities namely fibrosis and suspicious of tuberculosis. The performance of NN classifier before and after factor analysis are evaluated by Receiver Operating Characteristics(ROC) curve. A comparison study is also done with three set of features. These feature set include entropy and parameters extracted by Gray Level Co occurrence Matrix(GLCM) and Gray Level Run Length Matrix(GLRLM).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-invasive Method of Characterization of Fibrosis and Carcinoma Using Low-Dose Lung CT Images","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2013.371","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689802/6721750/06722124.pdf","startPage":"2168","endPage":"2172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721750","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6722124","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722124/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Non-invasive Method of Characterization of Fibrosis and Carcinoma Using Low-Dose Lung CT Images","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6722124/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14067193","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-invasive Method of Characterization of Fibrosis and Carcinoma Using Low-Dose Lung CT Images","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652c168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045147S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6722124","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6722136,"authors":[{"name":"Lufuno Marwala","affiliation":["School of electrical and electronic engineering, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa"],"firstName":"Lufuno","lastName":"Marwala","id":"37086029942"},{"name":"Bhekisipho Twala","affiliation":["School of electrical and electronic engineering, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa"],"firstName":"Bhekisipho","lastName":"Twala","id":"37395921400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0652-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6722136","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forecasting","Electricity","Computational modeling","Biological neural networks","Predictive models","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","fuzzy neural nets","load forecasting","multilayer perceptrons","power consumption","power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models","neuro-fuzzy modelling technique","back propagation","multilayer perceptron neural network","historical electricity consumption time series data","neuro-fuzzy systems","neural networks","South Africa","univariate modelling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["forecasting","neuro-fuzzy","electrictity consumption","neural networks","Takagi-Sugeno"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6722136","abstract":"This paper presents an experiment that consists of constructing neural networks and neuro-fuzzy models with historical electricity consumption time series data to create models that can be used to forecast consumption in the future.

The clustering ensembles combine multiple partitions generated by different clustering algorithms into a single clustering solution. Clustering ensembles have emerged as a prominent method for improving robustness, stability and accuracy of clustering solutions. So far, many contributions have been made to find consensus clustering. One of the major problems in clustering ensembles is the consensus function. In this paper, the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) is proposed to solve the consensus clustering problem. We find that the particle swarm clustering algorithm is efficient for this problem. An empirical study compares the accuracy of our proposed algorithms with other consensus clustering methods including voting on five data sets. The experimental results show that the PSO consensus clustering method produces clustering's that are as good as, and often better than, these other methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722143/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14067687","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6722143/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Consensus Clustering Based on Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consensus Clustering Based on Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652c280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066769S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6722143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6722152,"authors":[{"name":"Keita Mochizuki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Infomatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Keita","lastName":"Mochizuki","id":"37085587160"},{"name":"Shun Nishide","affiliation":["Hakubi Center for Advanced Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Shun","lastName":"Nishide","id":"37564244200"},{"name":"Hiroshi G.

Humans are said to develop their drawing skills through five phases: 1) Scribbling, 2) Fortuitous Realism, 3) Failed Realism, 4) Intellectual Realism, 5) Visual Realism. We implement phases 1) and 3) into the humanoid robot NAO, holding a pen, using a neuro dynamical model, namely Multiple Timescales Recurrent Neural Network (MTRNN). For phase 1), we used random arm motion of the robot as body babbling to associate motor dynamics with pen position dynamics. For phase 3), we developed incremental imitation learning to imitate and develop the robot's drawing skill using basic shapes: circle, triangle, and rectangle. We confirmed two notable features from the experiment. First, the drawing was better performed for shapes requiring arm motions used in babbling. Second, performance of clockwise drawing of circle was good from beginning, which is a similar phenomenon that can be observed in human development. The results imply the capability of the model to create a developmental robot relating to human development.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722152/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14067466","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6722152/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Developmental Human-Robot Imitation Learning of Drawing with a Neuro Dynamical System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Developmental Human-Robot Imitation Learning of Drawing with a Neuro Dynamical System","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652c336.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071176S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6722152","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6722157,"authors":[{"name":"Yen-Liang Pan","affiliation":["Department of Avionic Engineering, Air Force Academy, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Yen-Liang","lastName":"Pan","id":"37534347800"},{"name":"Mu-Der Jenga","affiliation":["National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, TW"],"firstName":"Mu-Der","lastName":"Jenga"},{"name":"Sheng-Luen Chungb","firstName":"Sheng-Luen","lastName":"Chungb"},{"name":"Yu-Xin Guoa","affiliation":["National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, TW"],"firstName":"Yu-Xin","lastName":"Guoa"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0652-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6722157","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"abstract":"Deadlock prevention policies are used to solve the deadlock problems of flexible manufacturing systems. Theory of regions is the efficient method for obtaining optimal (i.e. maximally permissive) controllers. All legal and live maximal behavior can be preserved by using marking/transition-separation instances (MTSIs) or event-state-separation-problem (ESSP) methods. However, solving all sets of inequalities is very time-consuming. Moreover, the number of linear programming problems (LPPs) of all legal markings is also exponential with net size. In this paper, a novel methodology is proposed to reduce the number of MTSIs/ESSPs and LPPs. Preciously, one new concept called critical ones of crucial marking/transition-separation instances (COCMTSI) is developed and used in this deadlock prevention policy that allows designers to employ few MTSIs to deal with deadlocks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689802/6721750/06722157.pdf","startPage":"2366","endPage":"2371","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2013.404","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721750","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6722157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computationally Improved Optimal Deadlock Prevention Policy for Linear Programming Problems of Flexible Manufacturing Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System recovery","Law","Mathematical model","Equations","Firing","Linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible manufacturing systems","linear programming","Petri nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal deadlock prevention policy","linear programming problems","flexible manufacturing systems","optimal controllers","maximal behavior","MTSI method","marking-transition-separation instances","ESSP method","event-state-separation-problem","LPP","legal markings","crucial marking-transition-separation instances","COCMTSI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Petri nets","linear programming problems","deadlock prevention","theory of regions","flexible manufacturing system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722157/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Computationally Improved Optimal Deadlock Prevention Policy for Linear Programming Problems of Flexible Manufacturing Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6722157/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14067132","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computationally Improved Optimal Deadlock Prevention Policy for Linear Programming Problems of Flexible Manufacturing Systems","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652c366.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089186S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6722157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6722159,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin J.

However, in order for basic Underwater Human-Robot Interaction (UHRI) to be successful, the robotic assistant has to first be able to detect and track the diver. This paper discusses the detection and tracking of a diver with a high-frequency forward-looking sonar. The first step in the diver detection involves utilizing classical 2D image processing techniques to segment moving objects in the sonar image. The moving objects are then passed through a blob detection algorithm, and then the blob clusters are processed by the cluster classification process. Cluster classification is accomplished by matching observed cluster trajectories with trained Hidden Markov Models (HMM), which results in a cluster being classified as either a diver or clutter. Real-world results show that a moving diver can be autonomously distinguished from stationary objects in a noisy sonar image and tracked.","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2013.406","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689802/6721750/06722159.pdf","startPage":"2378","endPage":"2383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sonar-Based Detection and Tracking of a Diver for Underwater Human-Robot Interaction Scenarios","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722159/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Sonar-Based Detection and Tracking of a Diver for Underwater Human-Robot Interaction Scenarios","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6722159/","accessionNumber":"14067134","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sonar-Based Detection and Tracking of a Diver for Underwater Human-Robot Interaction Scenarios","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652c378.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03556S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6722159","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6722175,"authors":[{"name":"Arif Jamal Malik","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Arif Jamal","lastName":"Malik","id":"37721276300"},{"name":"Farrukh Aslam Khan","affiliation":["Center of Excellence in Information Assurance (CoEIA), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Farrukh Aslam","lastName":"Khan","id":"37677677900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0652-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6722175","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":265},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Classification algorithms","Intrusion detection","Training","Probes","Vegetation","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","data mining","evolutionary computation","particle swarm optimisation","pattern classification","random processes","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["regression techniques","pattern classification","multiobjective PSO approach","KDD99Cup dataset","feature selection","intrusion detection rate","multiobjective particle swarm optimization approach","false discovery rate","evolutionary approach","network resource manipulation","unauthorized access","network security","intrusion prevention system","network intrusions","PROBE attacks detection","random forests","hybrid technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Intrusion detection","Multi-objective optimization","Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Random forests (RF)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6722175","abstract":"A system connected to a network is an open choice for network intrusions unless a powerful intrusion detection or prevention system is implemented.

In this paper, a binary version of multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach is used to detect PROBE attacks in a network. A vector evaluated PSO approach is used in the proposed technique with two objectives i.e., intrusion detection rate and false discovery rate, to guide the process of feature selection. The experiments are performed using the well-known KDD99Cup dataset. Multi-objective PSO approach is used for feature selection from a set of 41 features and Random Forests (RF), a highly accurate and fast algorithm, is used for classification.

Agent controllers are represented by Neural Networks (NN), and the connection weights and/or the structure of NN are optimized by evolutionary computation such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The agent's perceptual inputs are used as the inputs of NN. When the framework is applied to the agent control in platform games where a lot of perceptual information is available, the number of nodes in the input layer becomes enormous if all the information is used. Therefore, only the necessary information should be selected and used as the NN inputs, but it is difficult to select the appropriate information beforehand. In this research, we propose a new PSO method which can optimize not only the connecting weights of NN but also the selection of the perceptual information simultaneously. By our method, the increase of network size can be prevented and the controllers can be optimized efficiently. We examined the effectiveness of our method in the Mario AI Championship.","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2013.427","startPage":"2504","endPage":"2509","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721750","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689802/6721750/06722180.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neuroevolution by Particle Swarm Optimization with Adaptive Input Selection for Controlling Platform-Game Agent","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722180/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neuroevolution by Particle Swarm Optimization with Adaptive Input Selection for Controlling Platform-Game Agent","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6722180/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14067037","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neuroevolution by Particle Swarm Optimization with Adaptive Input Selection for Controlling Platform-Game Agent","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652c504.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066434S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6722180","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6722181,"authors":[{"name":"Annabel Latham","affiliation":["The Intelligent Systems Group, The Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Annabel","lastName":"Latham","id":"37901181300"},{"name":"Keeley Crockett","affiliation":["The Intelligent Systems Group, The Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Keeley","lastName":"Crockett","id":"37329428500"},{"name":"David Mclean","affiliation":["The Intelligent Systems Group, The Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Mclean","id":"37340934000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0652-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6722181","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":338},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6722181","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","Tutorials","Hidden Markov models","Computational modeling","Adaptation models","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["behavioural sciences computing","intelligent tutoring systems","multilayer perceptrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CITS","Felder learning styles dimensions","Silverman learning styles dimensions","teaching-learning environment","behaviour traits","learning styles predictor agent","student behaviour","automated conversational tutorial","MLP-ANN","multilayer perceptron artificial neural network","conversational intelligent tutoring system","computer-aided learning systems","student learning styles profiling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["affective computing","computer education and e-learning","intelligent tutoring systems","neural networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SMC.2013.428","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689802/6721750/06722181.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","startPage":"2510","endPage":"2515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721750","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Profiling Student Learning Styles with Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks","abstract":"Student profiling is central to the move from 'one size fits all' computer-aided learning systems to intelligent tutoring systems which adapt to meet the needs of different students. This paper proposes a new method for profiling student learning styles for a conversational intelligent tutoring system (CITS) which utilizes a Mulitlayer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN). Throughout an automated conversational tutorial with a CITS, aspects of student behaviour are dynamically captured and input to a Learning Styles Predictor agent to profile an individual's learning style. The proposed method will incorporate a MLP-ANN to combine a set of behaviour traits extracted from the tutoring conversation to improve the accuracy of the learning styles prediction. The paper describes experiments conducted with real students in a live teaching/learning environment for profiling two Felder and Silverman learning styles dimensions. The results show that MLP-ANNs can predict learning styles with an accuracy of 84-89%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722181/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14067116","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6722181/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Profiling Student Learning Styles with Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Profiling Student Learning Styles with Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652c510.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060699S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6722181","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6722185,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Chih Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Chih","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37291087300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0652-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6722185","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6722185","abstract":"This paper presents a direct adaptive motion controller using fuzzy wavelet neural networks (FWNN) for speed control of an electric two-wheeled robotic vehicle (ETWRV) with unknown parameters and uncertainties.

The virtual experience can decrease the interaction between the agent and the environment and make the agent perform value iterations quickly. Thus, the proposed agent has additional experience for updating the policy.

Depending on the source of the samples, important investigations, like disease progress, accurate diagnosis, drug response and prognosis after treatment, etc., can be done. The aim of this work is to identify the smallest set of genes, whose expression could classify a target disease with highest accuracy. In this work, we present a two stage feature reduction. In Stage 1, the number of genes are reduced from thousands to N (N ? 100). In Stage 1, individually the relevance of a gene for classification is considered. We proposed a fast algorithm, which can efficiently handle data with more than 2 classes. In Stage 2, we search for the smallest subset of genes, from those selected in Stage 1, so that the classification result is highest. We use wrapper method for feature selection. The selection of the optimum subset of genes is a combinatorial optimization problem, with two optimization criterion - minimizing the cardinality of the subset and maximizing the classification result. Multi-objective optimization Genetic Algorithm is used, and we proposed a new Pareto front which is suitable for the gene-selection problem. The effectiveness of our two stage algorithm is verified using three benchmark gene-expression data, Lung Cancer dataset, SRBC dataset, and MLL dataset.","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2013.449","startPage":"2629","endPage":"2634","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721750","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689802/6721750/06722202.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective Optimization Using Pareto GA for Gene-Selection from Microarray Data for Disease Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722202/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective Optimization Using Pareto GA for Gene-Selection from Microarray Data for Disease Classification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6722202/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14067494","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective Optimization Using Pareto GA for Gene-Selection from Microarray Data for Disease Classification","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652c629.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08136S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6722202","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6722207,"authors":[{"name":"Jair Cervantes","affiliation":["Posgrado de Investigaci\u00f3n, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma del Estado de M\u00e9xico, Texcoco, M\u00e9xico"],"firstName":"Jair","lastName":"Cervantes","id":"37586271700"},{"name":"Xiaoou Li","affiliation":["Departamento de Computaci\u00f3n, Centro de Investigaci\u00f3ny de Estudios Avanzados (CINVESTAV-IPN), M\u00e9xico, D.F., M\u00e9xico"],"firstName":"Xiaoou","lastName":"Li","id":"37280872700"},{"name":"Wen Yu","affiliation":["Departamento de Control Autom\u00e1tico, Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y de Estudios Avanzados (CINVESTAV-IPN), Mexico, D.F., M\u00e9xico"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Yu","id":"37279841300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0652-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6722207","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":299},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6722207","abstract":"Many real data sets are imbalanced, which contain a large number of certain type objects and a very small number of opposite type objects.

Finally, SVM is used again to find the best hyper plane from the generated data points.

In order to reduce the motor damage and let train motions more convenient, a robotics simulator system for humanoid robots is designed. This robotics simulator system is established by an open source software-Open Dynamics Engine (ODE). The model of David developed by aiRobots laboratory is a combination of rigid bodies and joints. The humanoid robot is trained on the robotics simulator system with PSO method, which chooses the trajectory of robot's center of mass as the fitness value to learn faster and stable gait automatically. The results of the experiment show that the motions which play on the robotics simulator system are very similar to the real motions, so it can be utilized as the motion training platform. The result of the PSO gait learning method has great performance on the robotics simulator system. The humanoid robot learns gait pattern from marking time to moving center of mass and swing its legs. Finally, this gait let the real humanoid robot walk forward at 14.5 cm/s.","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2013.457","startPage":"2683","endPage":"2688","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689802/6721750/06722211.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of Humanoid Robot Simulator for Gait Learning by Using Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Legged locomotion","Joints","Humanoid robots","Hip","Solid modeling","Particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","gait analysis","humanoid robots","mobile robots","motion control","particle swarm optimisation","public domain software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["humanoid robot simulator","gait learning","particle swarm optimization","PSO","adult-sized humanoid robots","motor damage","robotics simulator system","open source software","open dynamics engine","ODE","aiRobots laboratory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["humanoid robot","simulator","gait learning","particle swarm optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722211/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Development of Humanoid Robot Simulator for Gait Learning by Using Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6722211/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14067554","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of Humanoid Robot Simulator for Gait Learning by Using Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652c683.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071523S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6722211","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6722274,"authors":[{"name":"Antonin Novak","affiliation":["Department of Cybernetics, Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Antonin","lastName":"Novak","id":"38243137400"},{"name":"Jan Sedivy","affiliation":["Department of Cybernetics, Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Sedivy","id":"37282769500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0652-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6722274","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Noise measurement","Internet","Encyclopedias","Electronic publishing","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","learning (artificial intelligence)","query processing","spelling aids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pairwise learning","search query correction rank","search query spelling correction system","noisy channel model","Czech Internet search query set","feature vector structure","feature vector signals","learning to rank model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["query correction","machine learning","feature vector","noisy channel model","learning to rank"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6722274","abstract":"This article introduces a new algorithm for a Search Query Spelling Correction System.

In the present work, we propose a method for classifying single-trial ERPs using a combination of the Lifting Wavelet Transform (LWT), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). In particular, the LWT filters, the set of EEG channels and SVM parameters that maximize the classification accuracy are searched using PSO. We evaluate the method's performance through offline analyses on the datasets from the BCI Competitions II and III. The proposed method achieved in most cases a similar or higher classification accuracy than that achieved by other methods, and adapted wavelet basis functions and channel sets that match the time-frequency and spatial properties of the P300 ERP.","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2013.527","startPage":"3089","endPage":"3094","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689802/6721750/06722280.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards the Classification of Single-Trial Event-Related Potentials Using Adapted Wavelets and Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Classification algorithms","Accuracy","Feature extraction","Wavelet transforms","Electroencephalography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain-computer interfaces","electroencephalography","filtering theory","medical signal processing","particle swarm optimisation","support vector machines","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-trial event-related potential classification","adapted wavelets","particle swarm optimization","ERP","brain-machine interfaces","BMI","dense-array EEG signals","lifting wavelet transform","support vector machines","SVM","PSO","LWT filters","EEG channels","BCI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Brain-machine interface","event-related potentials","support vector machines","lifting scheme","particle swarm optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722280/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Towards the Classification of Single-Trial Event-Related Potentials Using Adapted Wavelets and Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6722280/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14067573","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards the Classification of Single-Trial Event-Related Potentials Using Adapted Wavelets and Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652d089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071334S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6722280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":6722293,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Qiang","affiliation":["Dept. of Control Science and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Qiang","id":"37339500500"},{"name":"Yingying Li","affiliation":["Dept. of Control Science and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yingying","lastName":"Li","id":"37086789314"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0652-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6722293","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":279},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switching circuits","Circuit faults","Inverters","Neural networks","Brushless DC motors","Fault diagnosis","Wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brushless DC motors","fault diagnosis","invertors","power engineering computing","power transistors","radial basis function networks","waveform analysis","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RBF neural network","brushless DC drive system","torque waveforms","speed waveforms","current waveforms","wavelet transform","short circuit switch","power transistor open switch","wavelets neural networks","motor inverter fault diagnosis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Inverter Fault diagnosis","Open switch","Short circuit switch","Wavelet transform","RBF neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6722293","abstract":"Diagnosis and location of the power transistor open switch and short circuit switch faults in inverter are studied.

However generalization in NN can be harmed by a number of factors including parameter's initialization, inappropriate network topology and setting parameters of the training process itself. Forecast combinations of NN models have the potential for improved generalization and lower training time. A weighted averaging based on Variance-Covariance method that assigns greater weight to the forecasts producing lower error, instead of equal weights is practiced in this paper. While implementing the method, combination of forecasts is done with all candidate models in one experiment and with the best selected models in another experiment. It is observed during the empirical analysis that forecasting accuracy is improved by combining the best individual NN models. Another finding of this study is that reducing the number of NN models increases the diversity and, hence, accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2013.548","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689802/6721750/06722301.pdf","startPage":"3214","endPage":"3219","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variance-Covariance Based Weighing for Neural Network Ensembles","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Variance-Covariance Based Weighing for Neural Network Ensembles","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14067446","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6722301/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variance-Covariance Based Weighing for Neural Network Ensembles","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652d214.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072302S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6722301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6722313,"authors":[{"name":"Vidya Bhushan Singh","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, USA"],"firstName":"Vidya Bhushan","lastName":"Singh","id":"38666534600"},{"name":"Snehasis Mukhopadhyay","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, USA"],"firstName":"Snehasis","lastName":"Mukhopadhyay","id":"37335567900"},{"name":"Meghna Babbar-Sebens","affiliation":["School of Civil and Construction Engineering, Oregon State University, Oregon, USA"],"firstName":"Meghna","lastName":"Babbar-Sebens","id":"38273103400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0652-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6722313","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Computational modeling","Optimization","Computers","Search problems","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["environmental science computing","fuzzy logic","human factors","information retrieval","neural nets","optimisation","parallel processing","user modelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["environmental resource optimization problem","fuzzy logic technique","nonlinear user modelling technique","HPC based framework","training data","user rating criteria","human fatigue","algorithmic search","human intuition","automated search","human participation","NP hard problems","environmental planning systems","multiobjective optimization problem","user search criteria","user preferences","information retrieval systems","neural network","interactive optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["user modelling","genetic algorithm","neural network","collaborative search","interactive algorithm","environmental planning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6722313","abstract":"User modelling is one of the prominent research fields in information retrieval systems.

However, even humans have some limitations for participation in that they cannot participate in search completely because of human fatigue. To overcome this, in our approach, an NN tries to model the user's rating criteria and preferences to help the user in rating large set of designs. Although training an NN with limited data is not always feasible, there are many situations where a simple modelling technique (e.g., linear/quadratic mapping) works better if the learning data set is small. In this paper we attempt to get more accuracy of the NN by generating data using other linear/non-linear techniques that fills the gap created by lack of sufficient training data. Also, we provided the architectural design of an HPC based framework we have proposed and compared the performance of the NN with fuzzy logic and other linear/non-linear user modelling techniques for the environmental resources optimization problem.","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2013.560","startPage":"3288","endPage":"3293","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721750","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689802/6721750/06722313.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User Modelling for Interactive Optimization Using Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722313/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"User Modelling for Interactive Optimization Using Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6722313/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14067518","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User Modelling for Interactive Optimization Using Neural Network","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652d288.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059631S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6722313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6722355,"authors":[{"name":"Takashi Okamoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Okamoto","id":"37587552100"},{"name":"Hironori Hirata","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Hironori","lastName":"Hirata","id":"37347039400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0652-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6722355","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"abstract":"The chaotic optimization method is a global optimization method to solve unconstrained optimization problems. Its superior search capability has been confirmed through applications to optimization problems which have high dimensional and multi-peaked objective functions. However, the chaotic optimization method has a drawback in that a parameter called initial sampling parameter has to be tuned on each optimization problem. In this study, we consider two approaches to perform the chaotic optimization method without the initial sampling parameter tuning. One is the initial sampling estimation method based on the characteristics of the chaotic optimization method. In this method, the sampling parameter at which the search trajectory bifurcates from the fixed point convergence to the two periodic solution trajectory, which is called the first bifurcating parameter, is computed from the approximation matrix to Hessian obtained by the quasi-Newton method. Then, suitable initial sampling parameter is estimated using this information. The other is the descent sign vector method. In this method, a descent sign vector extracted from a gradient vector is used as a search direction of a search point. Then, its moving distance is determined so that its search process shifts from the global search to the local search. We compare two methods and their hybrid method through numerical experiments for various optimization problems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization methods","Trajectory","Vectors","Search problems","Tuning","Chaos"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","convergence","Hessian matrices","Newton method","optimisation","parameter estimation","search problems","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local search method","global search method","moving distance","gradient vector","descent sign vector method","quasiNewton method","Hessian matrix","approximation matrix","first bifurcating parameter","two periodic solution trajectory","fixed point convergence","search trajectory","sampling parameter estimation","initial sampling estimation method","unconstrained optimization problems","global optimization method","chaotic optimization method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Globa Optimization","Nonlinear Optimization","Chaos","Parameter Tuning","Linear Stability Theory"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SMC.2013.602","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689802/6721750/06722355.pdf","startPage":"3529","endPage":"3536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721750","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chaotic Optimization Method without Initial Sampling Parameter Tuning - Empirical Comparisons of Two Approaches in Various Problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6722355","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Chaotic Optimization Method without Initial Sampling Parameter Tuning - Empirical Comparisons of Two Approaches in Various Problems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722355/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6722355/","accessionNumber":"14067163","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chaotic Optimization Method without Initial Sampling Parameter Tuning - Empirical Comparisons of Two Approaches in Various Problems","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652d529.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065762S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6722355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6722375,"authors":[{"name":"Chen-Chien Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Applied Electronics Technology, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chen-Chien","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37308458400"},{"name":"Chia-Jui Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Applied Electronics Technology, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Jui","lastName":"Kuo","id":"37086725336"},{"name":"Wen-Chung Kao","affiliation":["Department of Applied Electronics Technology, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Chung","lastName":"Kao","id":"37294891400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0652-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6722375","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":226},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6722375","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Robot kinematics","Monte Carlo methods","Estimation","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","Monte Carlo methods","path planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Monte Carlo localization algorithm","robust orientation estimation","mobile robots","IMCLROE","weight calculation mechanism","particle optimal orientation","tournament selection","position tracking","computational efficiency","localization accuracy","localization failure rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Monte Carlo Localization","Orientation Estimation","Particle Filter","Robot Localization","Position Tracking"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes an improved Monte Carlo Localization algorithm with robust orientation estimation (IMCLROE) by incorporating an orientation estimate and weight calculation mechanism to determine an optimal orientation for particles and a tournament selection to reduce the number of particles for position tracking.

Therefore, new approaches were developed, supported by the modern manufacturing paradigms bio-inspired background. However, somehow along the way the physical and logical nature of the system was partially lost, leading to the convergence of approaches towards more traditional systems, 'neglecting' their bio-inspired principles. With the present work the authors aim to introduce and analyse two new different self-organising approaches that try to bring the focus of manufacturing systems, again to the bio-inspired principles. For this purpose, in the context of this work, manufacturing systems are approached from a bottom-up perspective, in an attempt to reduce the specification of the production processes to the minimum and foster the production emergence.

One of the principle reasons for these developments has been to enhance the recongurability of a manufacturing system, allowing it to readily adapt to changes over time. However, to date, recongurability assessment has been limited. Hence, the efficacy of these design approaches remains quantitatively inconclusive. More recently, a systematic approach to reconfigurability measurement based upon the concepts of reconfiguration \"potential\" and reconfiguration \"ease\" has been developed using axiomatic design and design structure matrices respectively. The measures of reconfiguration potential called production degrees of freedom were specifically used to calculate production paths of a product line through a reconfigurable manufacturing system. This paper rearticulates the previous scalar-based calculation in terms of a axiomatic design matrix-based development founded in graph theory for three major benefits. First, this approach establishes a link between the RMS literature and graph theory where path enumeration has long been associated with network reliability and resilience. Second, the approach bases its measures strictly on the evolving system architecture variables in both function and form. In so doing, it roots itself in the established engineering design concept of the axiomatic design knowledge base for large flexible systems. Finally, the formulaic expressions lend themselves to significant computational savings.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722412/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14067080","htmlLink":"/document/6722412/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Axiomatic Design Approach to Production Path Enumeration in Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Axiomatic Design Approach to Production Path Enumeration in Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652d862.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105158S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6722412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6722484,"authors":[{"name":"Lan Wang","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Lan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086665154"},{"name":"Pingyang Dai","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Pingyang","lastName":"Dai","id":"37665914000"},{"name":"Yanlong Luo","affiliation":["Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, CN"],"firstName":"Yanlong","lastName":"Luo"},{"name":"Cuihua Li","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Cuihua","lastName":"Li","id":"37403927300"},{"name":"Yi Xie","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Xie","id":"37594157200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0652-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6722484","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Feature extraction","Visualization","Proposals","Markov processes","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","computer vision","feature extraction","image classification","Markov processes","Monte Carlo methods","object tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual tracking","compressive sensing MCMC sampling","real-time tracking method","computer vision","feature extraction","nonadaptive random projections","sparse random measurement matrix","image feature space","Bayesian classifier","Markov chain Monte Carlo acceptance mechanism","two-stage tracking scheme","drift problem","public benchmark sequences"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive Sensing","MCMC Sampling","Bayesian Classifier"]}],"abstract":"Real time visual tracking is a challenge problem in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a real-time tracking method based on compressive sensing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. To extract the features of objects, non-adaptive random projections are employed in the object appearance model which adopts a very sparse random measurement matrix using compress sensing. These projection preserve the structure of objects in the image feature space. A Bayesian classifier is learnt from the object appearance model and the scores of this classifier are integrated into Markov Chain Monte Carlo acceptance mechanism. Furthermore, a two-stage tracking scheme is used to alleviate the drift problem. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is real time and outperforms some start-of-the-art algorithms on public benchmark sequences in terms of accuracy and robustness.","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2013.731","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689802/6721750/06722484.pdf","startPage":"4288","endPage":"4293","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual Tracking Based on Compressive Sensing MCMC Sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6722484","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722484/","displayDocTitle":"Visual Tracking Based on Compressive Sensing MCMC Sampling","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14067213","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6722484/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual Tracking Based on Compressive Sensing MCMC Sampling","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652e288.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05147S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6722484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6722488,"authors":[{"name":"Basabi Chakraborty","affiliation":["Faculty of Software and Information Science, Iwate Prefectural University, Takizawamura, Iwate, Japan"],"firstName":"Basabi","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"37282469600"},{"name":"Goutam Chakraborty","affiliation":["Faculty of Software and Information Science, Iwate Prefectural University, Takizawamura, Iwate, Japan"],"firstName":"Goutam","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"37328979200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0652-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6722488","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy Consistency Measure with Particle Swarm Optimization for Feature Selection","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689802/6721750/06722488.pdf","startPage":"4311","endPage":"4315","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721750","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2013.735","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Atmospheric measurements","Particle measurements","Particle swarm optimization","Sociology","Statistics","Measurement uncertainty","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","evolutionary computation","fuzzy set theory","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal feature subset","evolutionary computational technique","machine learning problem","data mining","pattern recognition","dimensionality reduction","feature selection","particle swarm optimization","fuzzy consistency based evaluation measure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Consistency measure","Fuzzy consistency measure","feature subset selection","particle swarm optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6722488","abstract":"Feature selection or dimensionality reduction is an important task for any pattern recognition, data mining or machine learning problem. For selection of the optimal subset of relevant features, two steps are needed. In the first step a measure is designed for the evaluation of a candidate feature subset and in the second step, search through the feature space is done for selecting the optimal one. Existing feature selection methodologies use combinations of various evaluation measures and search strategies for selecting optimal feature subset. Though a large number of effective methodologies are already developed, none of them is perfect. Research is still going on to find better algorithm with lesser computational cost. In this work a fuzzy consistency based evaluation measure has been proposed. Consequently a feature selection algorithm using the proposed fuzzy consistency measure with particle swarm optimization, an evolutionary computational technique widely used for optimization problems, is developed for selecting optimal feature subset. Simple simulation experiments with bench mark data sets have been done and the simulation results provide evidence that the proposed algorithm might be a good candidate for selecting optimal feature subset.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722488/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14067441","htmlLink":"/document/6722488/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy Consistency Measure with Particle Swarm Optimization for Feature Selection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy Consistency Measure with Particle Swarm Optimization for Feature Selection","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652e311.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051155S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6722488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6722503,"authors":[{"name":"Soodamani Ramalingam","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Technology, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, Herts, UK"],"firstName":"Soodamani","lastName":"Ramalingam","id":"37603417300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0652-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6722503","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"abstract":"In this paper, the author presents a work on i) range data and ii) stereo-vision system based disparity map profiling that are used as signatures for 3D face recognition.

The pantograph overhead system is monitored by using a digital camera. A general framework for anomaly detection for pantograph-catenary system consists of two key components. The first component is based on mean-shift tracking of contact wire. Therefore, the contact point between pantograph and catenary can be continuously monitored and anomaly contact to some points will be detected. The second component uses Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for foreground detection. When the foreground of the current frame has been detected, the mean-shift tracking and GMM combines trajectory-based and region-based information for detection any anomaly in pantograph-catenary interaction. The experimental results show that proposed method is useful to detect burst of arcing, and irregular positioning of contact line.","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2013.757","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689802/6721750/06722511.pdf","startPage":"4444","endPage":"4449","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Robust Anomaly Detection in Pantograph-Catenary System Based on Mean-Shift Tracking and Foreground Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6722511","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722511/","displayDocTitle":"A Robust Anomaly Detection in Pantograph-Catenary System Based on Mean-Shift Tracking and Foreground Detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14067498","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6722511/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust Anomaly Detection in Pantograph-Catenary System Based on Mean-Shift Tracking and Foreground Detection","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652e444.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0973S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6722511","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6722516,"authors":[{"name":"Velin Dimitrov","affiliation":["Robotics Engineering Program, Worcester Polytechnic Institute"],"firstName":"Velin","lastName":"Dimitrov","id":"37085413974"},{"name":"Mathew DeDonato","affiliation":["Robotics Engineering Program, Worcester Polytechnic Institute"],"firstName":"Mathew","lastName":"DeDonato","id":"37085765526"},{"name":"Adam Panzica","affiliation":["Robotics Engineering Program, Worcester Polytechnic Institute"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Panzica","id":"37071125300"},{"name":"Samir Zutshi","affiliation":["Robotics Engineering Program, Worcester Polytechnic Institute"],"firstName":"Samir","lastName":"Zutshi","id":"37086650851"},{"name":"Mitchell Wills","affiliation":["Robotics Engineering Program, Worcester Polytechnic Institute"],"firstName":"Mitchell","lastName":"Wills","id":"37085512145"},{"name":"Taskin Padir","affiliation":["Robotics Engineering Program, Worcester Polytechnic Institute"],"firstName":"Taskin","lastName":"Padir","id":"38496444600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0652-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6722516","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Navigation","Manipulators","Robot sensing systems","Planning","Robot kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace robotics","aircraft navigation","manipulators","mobile robots","planetary rovers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robotic arm controller","sample return rover","cascade classifier","space exploration rover","tier navigation architecture","inverse Jacobian based robot arm controller","AERO","autonomous exploration rover","NASA sample return robot centennial challenge"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sample return rover","driving with tentacles","histogram of gradients","inverse jacobian"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6722516","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical Navigation Architecture and Robotic Arm Controller for a Sample Return Rover","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2013.761","startPage":"4476","endPage":"4481","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689802/6721750/06722516.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721750","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.761","abstract":"This work presents a hierarchical navigation architecture and cascade classifier for sample search and identification on a space exploration rover.

However, the passive degree of freedom poses an added challenge to the controls problem. This paper presents a controller design to increase the accuracy of straight line trajectories for rovers with passive suspension on rough terrain. The chosen approach uses only proprioceptive sensors, a 3D kinematic model, and a trivial ground plane estimator algorithm to adjust individual wheel velocities based on estimates of terrain slope. This has distinct advantages to other techniques that use global position sensors and dynamic models which inevitably lead to more complex and computationally intensive solutions. The proposed controller is simulated in Matlab and found to be successful through experiments conducted with ORYX 2.0, a planetary rover research platform. This paper presents the feed forward velocity controller design, simulations, and experimental results for validation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wheels","Kinematics","Suspensions","Three-dimensional displays","Trajectory","MATLAB","Feedforward neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","kinematics","planetary rovers","suspensions (mechanical components)","trajectory control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ORYX 2.0","3D kinematic model","straight line trajectories","controller design","ground compliance","mobility","passive averaging suspensions","rough terrain","planetary exploration rover","kinematic control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SMC.2013.763","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689802/6721750/06722518.pdf","startPage":"4488","endPage":"4493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721750","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.763","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kinematic Control of a Planetary Exploration Rover over Rough Terrain","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6722518","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Kinematic Control of a Planetary Exploration Rover over Rough Terrain","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722518/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6722518/","accessionNumber":"14067265","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kinematic Control of a Planetary Exploration Rover over Rough Terrain","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652e488.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06167S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6722518","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6722578,"authors":[{"name":"Junhai Zhai","affiliation":["Key Lab. of Machine Learning & Comput.

The communication topology of the multi-agent system that describes completely unknown nonlinear dynamics and unmeasured states is described by a directed graph. The proposed decentralized control algorithm is developed based on high-gain observer theory and fuzzy adaptive control algorithm. The high-gain observer is introduced to estimate the agents' unmeasured states. The fuzzy logic systems are used as the approximator to deal with the nonlinear unknown dynamics. By the Lyapunov theory and consensus analysis, we can prove the consensus errors and the observer errors can be reduced as small as desired by choosing the appropriate design parameters. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by the simulation example.","doi":"10.1109/SMC.2013.843","startPage":"4935","endPage":"4940","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689802/6721750/06722594.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.843","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized Control for Second-Order Uncertain Nonlinear Multi-agent Systems Consensus Problem Based on Fuzzy Adaptive High-Gain Observer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multi-agent systems","Observers","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Decentralized control","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","control system synthesis","decentralised control","directed graphs","fuzzy control","Lyapunov methods","multi-robot systems","nonlinear control systems","nonlinear dynamical systems","observers","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design parameters","observer errors","consensus errors","consensus analysis","Lyapunov theory","fuzzy logic systems","agents unmeasured states estimation","fuzzy adaptive control algorithm","directed graph","unknown nonlinear dynamics","communication topology","second-order uncertain nonlinear multiagent systems consensus problem","decentralized control approach","fuzzy adaptive high-gain observer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multi-agent systems; high-gain state observer; adaptive decentralized control; consensus control; nonlinear unknown dynamics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722594/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Control for Second-Order Uncertain Nonlinear Multi-agent Systems Consensus Problem Based on Fuzzy Adaptive High-Gain Observer","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6722594/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14067699","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Control for Second-Order Uncertain Nonlinear Multi-agent Systems Consensus Problem Based on Fuzzy Adaptive High-Gain Observer","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"0652e935.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110543S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689802","isNumber":"6721750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689802","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6721750","articleId":"6722594","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6722610,"authors":[{"name":"Gokce Gurun","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/6722598/6722610/6722610-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gokce Gurun received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2006.

Integration of capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) arrays with front-end electronics in single-chip configuration allows for implementation of such catheter probes with reduced interconnect complexity, miniaturization, and high mechanical flexibility. We implemented a single-chip forward-looking (FL) ultrasound imaging system by fabricating a 1.4-mm-diameter dual-ring CMUT array using CMUT-on-CMOS technology on a front-end IC implemented in 0.35-\u03bcm CMOS process. The dual-ring array has 56 transmit elements and 48 receive elements on two separate concentric annular rings. The IC incorporates a 25-V pulser for each transmitter and a low-noise capacitive transimpedance amplifier (TIA) for each receiver, along with digital control and smart power management. The final shape of the silicon chip is a 1.5-mm-diameter donut with a 430-\u03bcm center hole for a guide wire. The overall front-end system requires only 13 external connections and provides 4 parallel RF outputs while consuming an average power of 20 mW. We measured RF A-scans from the integrated single- chip array which show full functionality at 20.1 MHz with 43% fractional bandwidth. We also tested and demonstrated the image quality of the system on a wire phantom and an ex vivo chicken heart sample. The measured axial and lateral point resolutions are 92 \u03bcm and 251 \u03bcm, respectively. We successfully acquired volumetric imaging data from the ex vivo chicken heart at 60 frames per second without any signal averaging. These demonstrative results indicate that single-chip CMUT-on-CMOS systems have the potential to produce realtime volumetric images with image quality and speed suitable for catheter-based clinical applications.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2014.6722610","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/58/6722598/06722610.pdf","startPage":"239","endPage":"250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2014.6722610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6722598","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-chip CMUT-on-CMOS front-end system for real-time volumetric IVUS and ICE imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6722610","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722610/","displayDocTitle":"Single-chip CMUT-on-CMOS front-end system for real-time volumetric IVUS and ICE imaging","volume":"61","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2014","accessionNumber":"14056158","pubMedId":"24474131","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6722610/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-chip CMUT-on-CMOS front-end system for real-time volumetric IVUS and ICE imaging","sourcePdf":"t1420239.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138147S","chronDate":"February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"6722598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"6722598","articleId":"6722610","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6722611,"authors":[{"name":"Kuang-Wei Lin","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/6722598/6722611/6722611-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kuang-Wei Lin was born and raised in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

Conventional histotripsy treatments have used longer pulses from 3 to 10 cycles, wherein the lesionproducing bubble cloud generation depends on the pressurerelease scattering of very high peak positive shock fronts from previously initiated, sparsely distributed bubbles (the shockscattering mechanism). In our recent work, the peak negative pressure (P-) for generation of dense bubble clouds directly by a single negative half cycle, the intrinsic threshold, was measured. In this paper, the dense bubble clouds and resulting lesions (in red blood cell phantoms and canine tissues) generated by these supra-intrinsic threshold pulses were studied. A 32-element, PZT-8, 500-kHz therapy transducer was used to generate very short (<;2 cycles) histotripsy pulses at a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 1 Hz and P- from 24.5 to 80.7 MPa. The results showed that the spatial extent of the histotripsy-induced lesions increased as the applied P- increased, and the sizes of these lesions corresponded well to the estimates of the focal regions above the intrinsic cavitation threshold, at least in the lower pressure regime (P- = 26 to 35 MPa). The average sizes for the smallest reproducible lesions were approximately 0.9 - 1.7 mm (lateral - axial), significantly smaller than the -6-dB beamwidth of the transducer (1.8 - 4.0 mm). These results suggest that, using the intrinsic threshold mechanism, well-confined and microscopic lesions can be precisely generated and their spatial extent can be estimated based on the fraction of the focal region exceeding the intrinsic cavitation threshold. Because the supra-threshold portion of the negative half cycle can be precisely controlled, lesions considerably less than a wavelength are easily produced, hence the term microtripsy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Histotripsy beyond the intrinsic cavitation threshold using very short ultrasound pulses: microtripsy","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2014.6722611","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/58/6722598/06722611.pdf","startPage":"251","endPage":"265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2014.6722611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6722598","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6722611","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722611/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2014","displayDocTitle":"Histotripsy beyond the intrinsic cavitation threshold using very short ultrasound pulses: microtripsy","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6722611/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","publicationDate":"February 2014","accessionNumber":"14056170","pubMedId":"24474132","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Histotripsy beyond the intrinsic cavitation threshold using very short ultrasound pulses: microtripsy","sourcePdf":"t1420251.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073338S","chronDate":"February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"6722598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"6722598","articleId":"6722611","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6722612,"authors":[{"name":"Alex Sampaleanu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/6722598/6722612/6722612-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alex Sampaleanu received his B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering with a specialization in nano engineering in 2011 and his M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering with a specialization in microsystems and nanodevices in 2013 from the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.","He has been working since 2011 as a research and teaching assistant under the supervision of Dr. Roger Zemp at the University of Alberta, where his work included designing, fabricating, testing, and simulating capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducers.","In 2011, he received the NSERC Alexander Graham Bell Canada Graduate Scholarship, and the APEGGA Past President's medal in Electrical Engineering.

Capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducers offer a promising solution for such 2-D array applications, but channel routing is still non-trivial. A top-orthogonal-to-bottom-electrode (TOBE) 2-D CMUT array architecture is presented along with row-column addressing schemes for low-channel-count 3-D ultrasound imaging. An N \u00d7 N TOBE array is capable of obtaining 3-D images using only 2N channels. An interfacing scheme is presented in which transmit-receive signals are routed along rows while bias voltages are applied along columns, effectively allowing for single-element transmit/receive control. Simulations demonstrated potentially finer resolution and improved side lobe suppression over a previously published row-column-based imaging method. Laser vibrometer testing was done to measure membrane displacement in air and confirmed that single-element air-coupled actuation in transmit mode could be achieved using our proposed interfacing scheme. Acoustic testing was also performed in both transmit and receive modes to characterize the ability of the proposed interfacing scheme to achieve dominant-element transmission and reception in immersion operation. It was seen that membrane displacement in both modes was indeed largely confined to the active area.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722612/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"61","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"February 2014","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14056169","htmlLink":"/document/6722612/","pubMedId":"24474133","displayDocTitle":"Top-orthogonal-to-bottom-electrode (TOBE) CMUT arrays for 3-D ultrasound imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Top-orthogonal-to-bottom-electrode (TOBE) CMUT arrays for 3-D ultrasound imaging","sourcePdf":"t1420266.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105156S","chronDate":"February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"6722598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6722598","articleId":"6722612","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6722614,"authors":[{"name":"Clement Papadacci","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot-Paris 7, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/6722598/6722614/6722614-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Clement Papadacci was born in February 1988 in Paris, France.

In this paper, we propose ultrafast imaging of the heart with adapted sector size by coherently compounding diverging waves emitted from a standard transthoracic cardiac phased-array probe. As in ultrafast imaging with plane wave coherent compounding, diverging waves can be summed coherently to obtain high-quality images of the entire heart at high frame rate in a full field of view. To image the propagation of shear waves with a large SNR, the field of view can be adapted by changing the angular aperture of the transmitted wave. Backscattered echoes from successive circular wave acquisitions are coherently summed at every location in the image to improve the image quality while maintaining very high frame rates. The transmitted diverging waves, angular apertures, and subaperture sizes were tested in simulation, and ultrafast coherent compounding was implemented in a commercial scanner. The improvement of the imaging quality was quantified in phantoms and in one human heart, in vivo. Imaging shear wave propagation at 2500 frames/s using 5 diverging waves provided a large increase of the SNR of the tissue velocity estimates while maintaining a high frame rate. Finally, ultrafast imaging with 1 to 5 diverging waves was used to image the human heart at a frame rate of 4500 to 900 frames/s over an entire cardiac cycle. Spatial coherent compounding provided a strong improvement of the imaging quality, even with a small number of transmitted diverging waves and a high frame rate, which allows imaging of the propagation of electromechanical and shear waves with good image quality.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2014.6722614","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/58/6722598/06722614.pdf","startPage":"288","endPage":"301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2014.6722614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6722598","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-contrast ultrafast imaging of the heart","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6722614","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722614/","displayDocTitle":"High-contrast ultrafast imaging of the heart","volume":"61","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2014","accessionNumber":"14056160","pubMedId":"24474135","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6722614/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-contrast ultrafast imaging of the heart","sourcePdf":"t1420288.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093367S","chronDate":"February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"6722598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"144","xplore-issue":"6722598","articleId":"6722614","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6722615,"authors":[{"name":"Kerstin Rohde","affiliation":["Sektion Biomedizinische Bildgebung, Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/6722598/6722615/6722615-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kerstin Rohde was born in Hannover, Germany, on November 7, 1977.

The cortical shell is thought to be the major contributor to the mechanical competence of the femoral neck, but its microstructural parameters are not sufficiently accessible under in vivo conditions with current X-ray-based methods. To systematically investigate the influences of pore size, porosity, and thickness of the femoral neck cortex on the propagation of ultrasound, we developed 96 different bone models (combining 6 different pore sizes with 4 different porosities and 4 different thicknesses) and simulated the ultrasound propagation using a finite-difference time-domain algorithm. The simulated singleelement emitter and receiver array consisting of 16 elements (8 inferior and 8 superior) were placed at anterior and posterior sides of the bone, respectively (transverse transmission). From each simulation, we analyzed the waveform collected by each of the inferior receiver elements for the one with the shortest time of flight. The first arriving signal of this waveform, which is associated with the wave traveling through the cortical shell, was then evaluated for its three different waveform characteristics (TOF: time point of the first point of inflection of the received signal, \u0394t: difference between the time point at which the signal first crosses the zero baseline and TOF, and A: amplitude of the first extreme of the first arriving signal). From the analyses of these waveform characteristics, we were able to develop multivariate models to predict pore size, porosity, and cortical thickness, corresponding to the 96 different bone models, with remaining errors in the range of 50 \u03bcm for pore size, 1.5% for porosity, and 0.17 mm for cortical thickness.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of porosity, pore size, and cortical thickness on the propagation of ultrasonic waves guided through the femoral neck cortex: a simulation study","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2014.6722615","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/58/6722598/06722615.pdf","startPage":"302","endPage":"313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2014.6722615","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6722598","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6722615","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722615/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2014","displayDocTitle":"Influence of porosity, pore size, and cortical thickness on the propagation of ultrasonic waves guided through the femoral neck cortex: a simulation study","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6722615/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","publicationDate":"February 2014","accessionNumber":"14056164","pubMedId":"24474136","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of porosity, pore size, and cortical thickness on the propagation of ultrasonic waves guided through the femoral neck cortex: a simulation study","sourcePdf":"t1420302.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145942S","chronDate":"February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"6722598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6722598","articleId":"6722615","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6722616,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Ricci","affiliation":["Information Engineering Department, Florence University, Firenze, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/6722598/6722616/6722616-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefano Ricci (M'07) received a degree in electronic engineering in 1997, and the Ph.D. degree in electronic systems engineering in 2001, both from the University of Florence.

However, the real-time implementation in US scanners is heavily hampered by the high calculation power required. In this work, we report a real-time vector Doppler imaging method which has been integrated in an open research system. The proposed approach exploits the plane waves transmitted from two sub-arrays of a linear probe to estimate the velocity vectors in 512 sample volumes aligned along the probe axis. The method has been tested for accuracy and reproducibility through simulations and in vitro experiments. Simulations over a 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 angle range of a 0.5 m/s peak parabolic flow have yielded 0.75\u00b0 bias and 1.1\u00b0 standard deviation for direction measurement, and 0.6 cm/s bias with 3.1% coefficient of variation for velocity assessment. In vitro tests have supported the simulation results. Preliminary measurements on the carotid artery of a volunteer have highlighted the real-time system capability of imaging complex flow configurations in an intuitive, easy, and quick way, as shown in a sample supplementary movie.

This paper studies how tissue properties impact the pressure threshold to initiate the cavitation bubble cloud. Our previous study showed that shock scattering off one or more initial bubbles, expanded to sufficient size in the focus, plays an important role in initiating a dense cavitation cloud. In this process, the shock scattering causes the positive pressure phase to be inverted, resulting in a scattered wave that has the opposite polarity of the incident shock. The inverted shock is superimposed on the incident negative pressure phase to form extremely high negative pressures, resulting in a dense cavitation cloud growing toward the transducer. We hypothesize that increased tissue stiffness impedes the expansion of initial bubbles, reducing the scattered tensile pressure, and thus requiring higher initial intensities for cloud initiation. To test this hypothesis, 5-cycle histotripsy pulses at pulse repetition frequencies (PRFs) of 10, 100, or 1000 Hz were applied by a 1-MHz transducer focused inside mechanically tunable tissue-mimicking agarose phantoms and various ex vivo porcine tissues covering a range of Young's moduli. The threshold to initiate a cavitation cloud and resulting bubble expansion were recorded using acoustic backscatter detection and optical imaging. In both phantoms and ex vivo tissue, results demonstrated a higher cavitation cloud initiation threshold for tissues of higher Young's modulus.

By assuming known transmitter pulse shaping filter, synchronous and asynchronous receiver scenarios have been considered. For each of these scenarios, the proposed algorithm is explained as follows: First, by introducing a combiner vector, an over-sampled signal of total duration equal to the symbol period is combined linearly. Second, for this combined signal, the Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) maximization and minimization problems are formulated as Rayleigh quotient optimization problems. Third, by using the solutions of these problems, the ratio of the signal energy corresponding to the maximum and minimum SNRs are proposed as a test statistics.

This paper describes a robust optimization (RO) model for wind power look-ahead dispatch. The model calculates allowable interval solutions for wind power generation and provides optimal economic solutions for conventional power generation to mitigate the uncertainty inherent to wind power.

A comprehensive anomaly detection approach not only should be able to detect and identify the emerging anomalies but has to characterize the essence of these anomalies by visualizing the structures revealed within data in a way that is understandable to the end-user as well. In this paper, we consider fuzzy c-means (FCM) as a conceptual and algorithmic setting to deal with the problem of anomaly detection. Using a sliding window, the time series are divided into a number of subsequences, and the available spatiotemporal structure within each time window is discovered using the FCM method. In the sequel, an anomaly score is assigned to each cluster, and using a fuzzy relation formed between revealed structures, a propagation of anomalies occurring in consecutive time intervals is visualized. To illustrate the proposed method, several datasets (synthetic data, a simulated disease outbreak scenario, and Alberta temperature data) have been investigated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/6963534/06722892.pdf","startPage":"1612","endPage":"1624","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2014.2302456","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2014.2302456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6963534","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6722892","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection and Characterization in Spatial Time Series Data: A Cluster-Centric Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time series analysis","Spatial databases","Data visualization","Hidden Markov models","Time measurement","Data models","Computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","pattern clustering","security of data","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","anomaly characterization","spatial time series data","cluster-centric approach","spatiotemporal data","fuzzy c-means","FCM method","sliding window","anomaly score","fuzzy relation","synthetic data","simulated disease outbreak scenario","Alberta temperature data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly detection","anomaly propagation","fuzzy c-means (FCM)","fuzzy relation","reconstruction criterion","spatial time series data"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722892/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection and Characterization in Spatial Time Series Data: A Cluster-Centric Approach","volume":"22","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6722892/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14778329","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection and Characterization in Spatial Time Series Data: A Cluster-Centric Approach","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-pedrycz-2302456-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094561S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"6963534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6963534","articleId":"6722892","onlineDate":"24 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6722915,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Elbanhawi","affiliation":["RMIT University, School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, Melbourne, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/6705689/6722915/6722915-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohamed Elbanhawi received the B.Eng. degree in advanced manufacturing and mechatronics from RMIT University, Australia, in 2012, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

Sampling-based methods offer an efficient solution for what is otherwise a rather challenging dilemma of path planning. Consequently, these methods have been extended further away from basic robot planning into further difficult scenarios and diverse applications. A comprehensive survey of the growing body of work in sampling-based planning is given here. Simulations are executed to evaluate some of the proposed planners and highlight some of the implementation details that are often left unspecified. An emphasis is placed on contemporary research directions in this field. We address planners that tackle current issues in robotics. For instance, real-life kinodynamic planning, optimal planning, replanning in dynamic environments, and planning under uncertainty are discussed. The aim of this paper is to survey the state of the art in motion planning and to assess selected planners, examine implementation details and above all shed a light on the current challenges in motion planning and the promising approaches that will potentially overcome those problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722915/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"2014","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"2014","accessionNumber":"14066429","htmlLink":"/document/6722915/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Sampling-Based Robot Motion Planning: A Review","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Sampling-Based Robot Motion Planning: A Review","sourcePdf":"access-elbanhawi-2302442-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.381006S","chronDate":"2014","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"6705689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"299","xplore-issue":"6705689","articleId":"6722915","onlineDate":"24 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6722929,"authors":[{"name":"Huan-Ting Chen","affiliation":["Minnan Normal University, Zhangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6877756/6722929/6722929-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huan-Ting Chen (M\u201913) received the Ph.D. degree in radio physics from Xiamen University, Xiamen, China, in 2010.

The temperature distribution and light output of the LED systems have been measured using an infrared imaging system and a spectrophotocolorimeter with an integrating sphere.

The polynomial and the lookup table (LUT) predistortion schemes are two commonly used approaches. Both approaches require time to find the inverse characteristics of the PA to be predistorted. However, for DPD to be actually implemented in real-world scenarios, fast convergence is highly desirable. A low-complexity joint-polynomial/LUT predistortion PA linearizer is proposed to obtain fast linearization. The algorithm utilizes quadratic interpolation of the LUT, which reduces the required LUT size and hence reduces convergence time without degradation of linearity. Simulation result shows that the proposed method can achieve up to 500% improvement in convergence speed compared with the conventional linear interpolation approach for the wideband code-division multiple access application.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722931/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6722931/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14159360","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Quadratic-Interpolated LUT-Based Digital Predistortion Technique for Cellular Power Amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Quadratic-Interpolated LUT-Based Digital Predistortion Technique for Cellular Power Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"tcsii-liang-2296194-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06533S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"6766668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6766668","articleId":"6722931","onlineDate":"24 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6722934,"authors":[{"name":"Mikhail Simonov","affiliation":["Department of Energy, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/6819870/6722934/simon-2260676-small.gif","p":["\nMikhail Simonov received the M.Sc. degree (computer science,\nartificial-intelligence related) from Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia, and the Ph.D. degree (smart-grid related)\nfrom the Department of Energy, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.","He is currently with Istituto Superiore Mario Boella, Torino, Italy, and the Department of Energy, Politecnico di\nMilano.

The complex-exponential basis expansion model (CE-BEM) is utilized to approximate the channel of each individual hop and results in a coefficient vector with much smaller size, called in-BEM-CV. The channel estimation of the individual channel is then converted into the estimation of in-BEM-CVs. We develop an estimation algorithm with three steps: the standard least squares (LS) estimator, the time domain or the fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based decoupler, and the iterative LS-based refiner. We also optimize the training parameters, including the number, the position, and the power allocation of the pilot clusters by minimizing the estimation mean square error (MSE), and derive one performance lower bound for the proposed algorithm.

comprising four integrated on-chip sensors and a smart wireless acquisition system is realized in standard CMOS process for the first time. To intelligently process different types (C, R, I, and V) of sensor signals, a linear (R-square is 0.999) and reconfigurable sensor readout is proposed based on switched-capacitor circuit technology. In addition, a dual-input energy harvesting interface with conversion efficiency of 73% is also integrated to pick up light energy and RF power, which potentiates long-term use without battery replacement. The entire SoC occupies die area of 11.25 mm 2 and consumes only 942.9 \u03bcW. Experimental results show that four physiological parameters (temperature, glucose and protein concentration, and pH value) can be simultaneously monitored using this chip. This system can be seen as a universal sensor platform. Different types of sensors can be easily integrated into it for convenient use, which dramatically reduces time consuming of building a new sensor system.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2013.2297392","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/6777594/06722970.pdf","startPage":"851","endPage":"866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777594","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2013.2297392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Self-Powered CMOS Reconfigurable Multi-Sensor SoC for Biomedical Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6722970","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"A Self-Powered CMOS Reconfigurable Multi-Sensor SoC for Biomedical Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6722970/","publicationDate":"April 2014","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14196345","volume":"49","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 January 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Self-Powered CMOS Reconfigurable Multi-Sensor SoC for Biomedical Applications","sourcePdf":"jssc-huang-2297392-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146822S","chronDate":"April  2014","isNumber":"6777594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"75","articleId":"6722970","onlineDate":"24 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6722973,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Ali Akbar","affiliation":["College of Elect&Info Engineering, COMPUTER SYSTEM Lab., Dong-gu, Gwangju, South Korea, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Muhammad Ali","lastName":"Akbar","id":"37076506700"},{"name":"Jeong-A Lee","affiliation":["College of Elect&Info Engineering, COMPUTER SYSTEM Lab., Dong-gu, Gwangju, South Korea, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jeong-A","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086624524"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-8328"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0806"}],"articleNumber":"6722973","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":804},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6722973","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Transistors","Encoding","Digital arithmetic","Fault detection","Logic design"]}],"abstract":"We first show that self-checking presented in the above paper (ibid., vol. 54, no. 12, pp. 2696-2705, Dec. 2007) does not work for carry-select adder with input bits higher than 2.

Fabricated in 0.13 \u03bcm CMOS technology, the transceiver is optimized for sensor-gateway communications within a star-shaped network, and supports both the sensor and gateway operation modes. Binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation with high data rate (DR) of 1 to 8 Mbps is used in the uplink from sensor to gateway, while on-off keying (OOK) modulation with low DR of 100 kbps is adopted in the downlink. A fully integrated Class-E PA with moderate output power has also been proposed and achieves power efficiency of 53%. To minimize area usage, inductor reuse is adopted between PA and LNA, and eliminates the need of lossy T/R switch in the RF signal path. When used as sensor, the transceiver with frequency locked phase-locked loop (PLL) achieves TX (BPSK) power efficiency of 28% @ 0 dBm output power, and RX (OOK) sensitivity of -80 dBm @ 100 kbps while consuming only 780 \u03bcW. When configured as gateway, the transceiver achieves sensitivity levels of -92, -84.5, and -77 dBm for 1, 5, and 8 Mbps BPSK, respectively.

The GA is a global optimization method that can avoid the local minimum during the training in MLP and is implemented in binary and real number calculations. We have experiments on 31 simulated well log data and real data application. In the supervised training step, the input of the network is the apparent conductivity (Ca) and the desired output is the true formation conductivity (Ct). The best size of two-layer MLP is chosen as 10-9-10 by theorem and experiments. And we get the best parameters of binary GA and real number GA by sequential method. After getting the best MLP network in training, the corresponding true formation conductivity can be inverted for each input Ca pattern in testing process. From comparison of errors in experiments of simulated data, the real number GA has less error than that of binary GA. That is because the bit string in binary GA limits the range of weighting coefficient and has higher error. We also apply the best 10-9-10 MLP model to the inversion of real field well log data. It shows that this method can work on well log data inversion and is feasible.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6723082","startPage":"1544","endPage":"1547","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium - IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/6704876/6721065/06723082.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium - IGARSS","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6723082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilayer perceptron with genetic algorithm for well log data inversion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Genetic algorithms","Testing","Conductivity","Equations","Mathematical model","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data handling","genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","multilayer perceptrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Multilayer perceptron","genetic algorithm","well log data inversion","two-layer multilayer perceptron","MLP learning","nonlinear mapping","global optimization method","real data application","supervised training step","conductivity","sequential method","binary GA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multilayer perceptron","genetic algorithm","sequential method","well log data inversion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6723082/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-26 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Multilayer perceptron with genetic algorithm for well log data inversion","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6723082/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"21-26 July 2013","accessionNumber":"14058607","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilayer perceptron with genetic algorithm for well log data inversion","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"0001544.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09108S","chronDate":"21-26 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6704876","isNumber":"6721065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6704876","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6721065","articleId":"6723082","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6723164,"authors":[{"name":"Nico Adam","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center (DLR), Remote Sensing Technology Institute (IMF), Oberpfaffenhofen, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Nico","lastName":"Adam","id":"38505870100"},{"name":"Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center (DLR), Remote Sensing Technology Institute (IMF), Oberpfaffenhofen, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Fernando Rodriguez","lastName":"Gonzalez","id":"38255932500"},{"name":"Alessandro Parizzi","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center (DLR), Remote Sensing Technology Institute (IMF), Oberpfaffenhofen, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Parizzi","id":"37596648100"},{"name":"Ramon Brcic","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center (DLR), Remote Sensing Technology Institute (IMF), Oberpfaffenhofen, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Ramon","lastName":"Brcic","id":"37285065300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1114-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"6723164","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":274},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6723164","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless application protocol","Interferometry","Calibration","Coherence","Monitoring","Terrestrial atmosphere","Global Positioning System"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geomorphology","radar interferometry","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar","terrain mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wide area PSI","persistent scatterer interferometry","PSI algorithms","ESA Sentinel-1 mission","Earth surface global mapping","Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans","TOPS","PSI processing","volcanic area subsidence monitoring","seismogenic area subsidence monitoring","costal lowland","mountainous area landslides","mining regulation","groundwater regulation","wide area product","WAP processing results","seismogenic areas","Greece","Turkey"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI)","Wide Area Product (WAP) for PSI","troposphere stratification correction","GPS calibration"]}],"abstract":"In recent years, Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) [1], [2] has been widely used for scientific applications and has developed into an operational and commercially rewarding remote sensing technology. Now, ESA's upcoming Sentinel-1 mission allows a continuous, repeated without gap and global mapping of the Earth's surface based on Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS). The idea at ESA is to also extend PSI processing to such large coverages, mapping countries and continents. This will support users in subsidence monitoring of volcanic and seismogenic areas, of costal lowland, of landslides in mountainous areas and of mining and ground water regulation on a small scale. For this reason, a wide area product (WAP) for PSI monitoring has been developed at DLR. The paper has three specific objectives. The first objective is to list and describe the updated algorithms. In this context, we illustrate the improvement with respective processing examples. Our second objective is to explain the characteristics of the WAP. The last objective is to provide WAP processing results for seismogenic areas. The test cases of Greece and of Turkey demonstrate WAPs potential, its applicability and use.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6723164","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium - IGARSS","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium - IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/6704876/6721065/06723164.pdf","startPage":"1857","endPage":"1860","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6723164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wide area Persistent Scatterer Interferometry: Current developments, algorithms and examples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-26 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Wide area Persistent Scatterer Interferometry: Current developments, algorithms and examples","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-26 July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6723164/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14058938","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6723164/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide area Persistent Scatterer Interferometry: Current developments, algorithms and examples","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"0001857.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044468S","chronDate":"21-26 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6704876","isNumber":"6721065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6704876","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6721065","articleId":"6723164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6723204,"authors":[{"name":"Timo Balz","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Timo","lastName":"Balz","id":"37568732500"},{"name":"Lu Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37578529100"},{"name":"Mingsheng Liao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Mingsheng","lastName":"Liao","id":"37409065600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1114-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"6723204","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6723204","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing units","Abstracts","Indexes","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","graphics processing units","image coding","parallel architectures","radar imaging","stereo image processing","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient high-performance SAR image geocoding","graphics processing unit","GPU","floating-point operation","ARM architecture","CUDA","flexible SAR stereo-radargrammetry approach","NVIDIA Tesla C2070","CARMA DevKit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SAR","radargrammetry","geo-coding","GPU"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6723204","endPage":"2014","startPage":"2011","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium - IGARSS","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium - IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/6704876/6721065/06723204.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6723204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient high-performance SAR image geocoding with NVIDIA CARMA and its application in stereo radargrammetry","abstract":"Energy is the major limiting factor for high-performance computing.

However, minimizing the representation error by NMF is not sufficient for SMA since the unmixing results of NMF are not unique. Therefore, in this paper, a neighborhood preserving regularization, which preserves the local structure of the hyperspectral data on a low-dimensional manifold, is proposed to constrain NMF for unique solution in SMA. As a result, a Neighborhood Preserving constrained NMF (NP-NMF) algorithm is proposed for SMA of highly mixed hyperspectral data.

The search landscape is defined via a spatial accuracy metric observing both over and under segmentation.

Such images have information about materials on earth's surface expressed in many wavelengths that allow us to identify and classify those materials with more accuracy. In this work we used a combination of several classification methods in order to produce an accurate thematic map based on the remote sensed hyperspectral image classification. To perform the combination, three types of feature representation and two learning algorithms (Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Backpropagation Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP)) were used yielding six classification methods. Our approach proposal is based onWeighted Linear Combination (WLC), in which weights are found using Linear Programming (LP) - WLC-LP. Experiments are carried out using two well-known databases: Indian Pines, acquired by AVIRIS sensor; and Pavia University, acquired by ROSIS sensor. Results show the efficiency of our proposed approach which significantly reduces the time required to found optimal weights for the combiner compared to a previous approach based on Genetic Algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium - IGARSS","pdfPath":"/iel7/6704876/6721065/06723730.pdf","startPage":"4082","endPage":"4085","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium - IGARSS","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6723730","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6723730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6721065","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6723730","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ensemble of classifiers for remote sensed hyperspectral land cover analysis: An approach based on Linear Programming and Weighted Linear Combination","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Support vector machines","Accuracy","Genetic algorithms","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","geophysical image processing","hyperspectral imaging","image classification","land cover","multilayer perceptrons","remote sensing","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["classifiers ensemble","remote sensed hyperspectral land cover analysis","linear programming","weighted linear combination","hyperspectral images","thematic map","hyperspectral image classification","Support Vector Machines","Backpropagation Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network","Weighted Linear Combination","Linear Programming","Indian Pines","AVIRIS sensor","Pavia University","ROSIS sensor","Genetic Algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ensemble of classifiers","conscious combiners","hyperspectral images","classification","linear programming solver","cplex"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6723730/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-26 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Ensemble of classifiers for remote sensed hyperspectral land cover analysis: An approach based on Linear Programming and Weighted Linear Combination","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6723730/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14058693","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"21-26 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ensemble of classifiers for remote sensed hyperspectral land cover analysis: An approach based on Linear Programming and Weighted Linear Combination","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"0004082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070318S","chronDate":"21-26 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6704876","isNumber":"6721065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6704876","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6721065","articleId":"6723730","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6723731,"authors":[{"name":"Naoto Yokoya","affiliation":["Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoto","lastName":"Yokoya","id":"37588926500"},{"name":"Akira Iwasaki","affiliation":["Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Iwasaki","id":"37567246200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1114-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"6723731","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":300},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Data integration","Spatial resolution","PSNR"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","geophysical image processing","hyperspectral imaging","image fusion","image resolution","image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-calibration","HISUI higher-order product","high-spatial-resolution hyperspectral data","unmixing-based fusion","multispectral imager","Japanese next-generation earth-observing sensor","hyperspectral imager suite","multispectral data fusion mission","hyperspectral data fusion mission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hyperspectral and multispectral data fusion","unmixing","hyperspectral imager suite (HISUI)"]}],"abstract":"Hyperspectral imager suite (HISUI) is the Japanese next-generation earth-observing sensor composed of hyperspectral and multispectral imagers.

Femtocells tend to be densely deployed in populated areas such as the dormitories. However, the inter-tier interference seriously exists in the co-channel Densely Deployed Femtocell Network (DDFN). Since the Femtocell Access Points (FAPs) are randomly deployed by their customers, the interference cannot be predicted in advance. Meanwhile, new characteristics such as the short radius of femtocell and the small number of users lead to the inefficiency of the traditional frequency reuse algorithms such as Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR). Aiming for the downlink interference coordination in the DDFN, in this paper, we propose a User-oriented Graph based Frequency Allocation (UGFA) algorithm. Firstly, we construct the interference graph for users in the network. Secondly, we study the conventional graph based resources allocation algorithm. Then an improved two steps graph based frequency allocation mechanism is proposed. Simulation results show that UGFA has a high frequency reuse ratio mean while guarantees a better throughput.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User-oriented graph based frequency allocation algorithm for densely deployed femtocell network","publicationTitle":"China Communications","doi":"10.1109/CC.2013.6723879","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/6723867/06723879.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"65","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2013.6723879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6723867","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6723879","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6723879/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","displayDocTitle":"User-oriented graph based frequency allocation algorithm for densely deployed femtocell network","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14056183","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User-oriented graph based frequency allocation algorithm for densely deployed femtocell network","sourcePdf":"6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035617S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","isNumber":"6723867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","citationCount":"9","articleId":"6723879","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":6723882,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Yifei","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Yifei"},{"name":"Teng Yinglei","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Teng","lastName":"Yinglei"},{"name":"Wang Li","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Song Mei","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Mei"},{"name":"Wang Xiaojun","affiliation":["Dublin City University, Dublin, IE"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Xiaojun"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"6723882","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":317},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Sensors","Markov processes","Cognitive radio","Signal to noise ratio","Wireless sensor networks","Radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","hidden Markov models","linear programming","overlay networks","quality of service","radio spectrum management","stochastic processes","time-varying channels","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QoS provisioning energy saving dynamic access policy","overlay cognitive radio networks","hidden Markov channels","dynamic spectrum access policy","spectrum sensing","spectrum utilization","stochastic control theory","time varying characteristics","wireless channels","channel state","frame error rate","energy consumption","Markov decision process","linear programming","primal dual index heuristic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["energy saving","dynamic access","cognitive radio","hidden Markov model"]}],"abstract":"Dynamic spectrum access policy is crucial in improving the performance of overlay cognitive radio networks. Most of the previous works on spectrum sensing and dynamic spectrum access consider the sensing effectiveness and spectrum utilization as the design criteria, while ignoring the energy related issues and QoS constraints. In this article, we propose a QoS provisioning energy saving dynamic access policy using stochastic control theory considering the time-varying characteristics of wireless channels because of fading and mobility. The proposed scheme determines the sensing action and selects the optimal spectrum using the corresponding power setting in each decision epoch according to the channel state with the objective being to minimise both the frame error rate and energy consumption. We use the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to model a wireless channel, since the channel state is not directly observable at the receiver, but is instead embedded in the received signal. The procedure of dynamic spectrum access is formulated as a Markov decision process which can be solved using linear programming and the primal-dual index heuristic algorithm, and the obtained policy has an index-ability property that can be easily implemented in real systems. Simulation results are presented to show the performance improvement caused by the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/CC.2013.6723882","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/6723867/06723882.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6723867","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2013.6723882","publicationTitle":"China Communications","startPage":"92","endPage":"101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS provisioning energy saving dynamic access policy for overlay cognitive radio networks with hidden Markov channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6723882","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2013","displayDocTitle":"QoS provisioning energy saving dynamic access policy for overlay cognitive radio networks with hidden Markov channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6723882/","volume":"10","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14056173","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS provisioning energy saving dynamic access policy for overlay cognitive radio networks with hidden Markov channels","sourcePdf":"9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035593S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","isNumber":"6723867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6723882","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6723883,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang Jianjun","affiliation":["Peking University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Jianjun"},{"name":"Dong Mingke","affiliation":["Peking University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Mingke"},{"name":"Wang Da","affiliation":["Peking University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Da"},{"name":"Jin Ye","affiliation":["Peking University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Ye"},{"name":"Xiang Haige","affiliation":["Peking University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Haige"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"6723883","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":203},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6723883","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Complexity theory","Switches","Wires","Interleaved codes","Multiplexing","Parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic codes","decoding","error statistics","hypercube networks","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DVB-S2","WiMAX","error performance","shift values","SOSN-BPEG algorithm","simplified offset shuffle network block progressive edge-growth algorithm","CPM","circulant permutation matrix","QC-LDPC codes","quasicyclic low-density parity-check codes","BRLD","block row-layered decoder","a-posterior probability messages"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["QC-LDPC codes","construction algorithm","PEG algorithm","row-layered decoder","shuffle network"]}],"abstract":"Offset Shuffle Networks (OSNs) interleave a-posterior probability messages in the Block Row-Layered Decoder (BRLD) of Quasi-Cyclic Low-Density Parity-Check (QC-LDPC) codes. However, OSNs usually consume a significant amount of computational resources and limit the clock frequency, particularly when the size of the Circulant Permutation Matrix (CPM) is large. To simplify the architecture of the OSN, we propose a Simplified Offset Shuffle Network Block Progressive Edge-Growth (SOSN-BPEG) algorithm to construct a class of QC-LDPC codes. The SOSN-BPEG algorithm constrains the shift values of CPMs and the difference of the shift values in the same column by progressively appending check nodes. Simulation results indicate that the error performance of the SOSN-BPEG codes is the same as that of the codes in WiMAX and DVB-S2. The SOSN-BPEG codes can reduce the complexity of the OSNs by up to 54.3%, and can improve the maximum frequency by up to 21.7% for various code lengths and rates.","doi":"10.1109/CC.2013.6723883","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2013.6723883","startPage":"102","endPage":"113","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/6723867/06723883.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6723867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Construction of quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check codes for simplifying shuffle networks in layered decoder","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6723883/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Construction of quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check codes for simplifying shuffle networks in layered decoder","volume":"10","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14056180","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Construction of quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check codes for simplifying shuffle networks in layered decoder","sourcePdf":"10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02538S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","isNumber":"6723867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"6723883","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6723905,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-yi Pan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Complex Electromagnetic Environment Effects on Electronics and Information System, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Xiao-yi","lastName":"Pan","id":"37085345109"},{"name":"Qi-xiang Fu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Complex Electromagnetic Environment Effects on Electronics and Information System, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Qi-xiang","lastName":"Fu","id":"37085791408"},{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Complex Electromagnetic Environment Effects on Electronics and Information System, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37068253900"},{"name":"De-jun Feng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Complex Electromagnetic Environment Effects on Electronics and Information System, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"De-jun","lastName":"Feng","id":"37593628800"},{"name":"Guo-yu Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Complex Electromagnetic Environment Effects on Electronics and Information System, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Guo-yu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37694715500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1319-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6723905","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Radar imaging","Image resolution","Spaceborne radar","Imaging","Doppler effect"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sampling","jamming","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple false-target image","countering ISAR","subNyquist sampling","scatter-wave jamming","SWJ","repeater jamming","fake point scatterers","radar pulses","deceptive false-target images","jamming signal","bistatic ISAR configuration","simulated telecommunication satellite model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ISAR","scatter-wave jamming","sub-Nyquist sampling","bistatic ISAR","ISAR jamming"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6723905","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2013.6723905","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2013.6723905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6723891","publicationTitle":"2013, 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013, 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6713792/6723891/06723905.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple false-targets for countering ISAR based on sub-Nyquist sampling","abstract":"The scatter-wave jamming (SWJ) can form false-target images and the repeater jamming based on sub-Nyquist sampling can produce fake point scatterers in the down-range.

The key aspect is an inherent channel estimation that is enabled by an appropriate choice of possible transmitted sequences. Due to its principle the new transmission concept is called Detection by Inherent Channel Estimation (DICE). We do not follow a classical maximum likelihood approach to derive a receiver metric that is used to directly estimate the transmitted sequence. In contrast, we analyze the consequences of the correlation of consecutive channel coefficients and find a heuristic receiver metric that is supposed to represent the plausibility of the channel's changes. Afterwards, a design rule and a recursive construction algorithm for transmitted sequences are derived that guarantee highly distinguishable blocks of estimated consecutive channel coefficients at the receiver. Using this strategy, a transmission technique is established that outperforms the differential M-ary Orthogonal Keying (DMOK) technique at a similar receiver and transmitter complexity. We identify the key parameter that influences the irreducible error floor, which is typical of incoherent detection in the DICE system and show that this error floor can be pushed to practically irrelevant levels by the presented design of the transmitted sequences, even in extreme time variant channels with normalized Doppler frequencies greater than 0.1.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2013.6723909","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6723891","publicationTitle":"2013, 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013, 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6713792/6723891/06723909.pdf","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection by Inherent Channel Estimation in rapidly fading channels","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2013.6723909","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6723909","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Detection by Inherent Channel Estimation in rapidly fading channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6723909/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14061210","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6723909/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection by Inherent Channel Estimation in rapidly fading channels","confLoc":"Carrara, Australia","sourcePdf":"p16lewandowsky.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074702S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6713792","isNumber":"6723891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713792","xplore-issue":"6723891","articleId":"6723909","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6723915,"authors":[{"name":"Tinale Liu","affiliation":["University of Wollongong"],"firstName":"Tinale","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086186633"},{"name":"David Stirling","affiliation":["University of Wollongong"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Stirling","id":"37320908000"},{"name":"Le Chung Tran","affiliation":["University of Wollongong"],"lastName":"Le Chung Tran","id":"37087202145"},{"name":"Tad Wysocki","affiliation":["University of Nebraska-Lincoln"],"firstName":"Tad","lastName":"Wysocki","id":"37280338700"},{"name":"Beata Wysocki","affiliation":["University of Nebraska-Lincoln"],"firstName":"Beata","lastName":"Wysocki","id":"37268902300"},{"name":"Prashan Dissanayake Mudiyanselage","affiliation":["University of Wollongong"],"firstName":"Prashan Dissanayake","lastName":"Mudiyanselage","id":"37086679125"},{"name":"Peter James Vial","affiliation":["University of Wollongong"],"firstName":"Peter James","lastName":"Vial","id":"37268903500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1319-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6723915","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"abstract":"In this paper, we develop a Software Defined Radio (SDR) test bed to evaluate the Multiple Access Interference (MAI) effects over SISO and 2\u00d7MIMO systems.

Since the nonconvex structure of the problem is highly complicated, the existing approaches to relax the design problem into a convex program do not appear to be applicable. To solve this challenging nonconvex optimization problem, we introduce auxiliary variables and cast the design problem into a d.c.(difference of convex functions) program.

A cognitive radio performs communication by selecting a channel on an opportunistic basis. Thus the implementation of a cognitive radio for real-time application faces the challenge of sharing of a constantly varying sporadically available channel among multiple users. To this end we propose an energy efficient medium access control scheme for single-hop cognitive radio network (QCR-MAC) which provides four levels of QoS support with complexity equivalent to that of a single transceiver node. The scheme imparts QoS through the usage of different interframe spaces, which allows different priorities of winning a contention by packets from different applications. Two different channel access etiquettes are used according to the type of channel and data traffic. One spectrum etiquette favours stream based real-time data transfer while another favours bursty traffic. The protocol utilizes a beacon based structure for information interchange and thus allows contentions to be distributed on different channels whilst mitigating the control channel saturation problem. Simulation results shows the effectiveness of the proposed scheme over an existing similar work.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2013.6723917","displayPublicationTitle":"2013, 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6713792/6723891/06723917.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6723891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2013.6723917","publicationTitle":"2013, 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A QoS provisioning MAC protocol for Cognitive Radio Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6723917","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A QoS provisioning MAC protocol for Cognitive Radio Network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6723917/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6723917/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14061216","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A QoS provisioning MAC protocol for Cognitive Radio Network","confLoc":"Carrara, Australia","sourcePdf":"p23mishra.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082555S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6713792","isNumber":"6723891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713792","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6723891","articleId":"6723917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6723924,"authors":[{"name":"Hiromi Katayama","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science"],"firstName":"Hiromi","lastName":"Katayama","id":"37085467355"},{"name":"Yoshihisa Kishiyama","affiliation":["Kabushiki Kaisha NTT DoCoMo, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, JP"],"firstName":"Yoshihisa","lastName":"Kishiyama","id":"37299879400"},{"name":"Kenichi Higuchi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science"],"firstName":"Kenichi","lastName":"Higuchi","id":"37269866000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1319-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6723924","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":184},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Interference","Throughput","Frequency division multiplexing","Uplink","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","scheduling","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication systems","3.9 mobile communication systems","nonorthogonal user multiplexing","multiuser diversity gain","fractional frequency reuse","frequency block-dependent parameter","MMSE-SIC","successive interference canceller","linear filtering","minimum mean squared error","cellular uplink","nonorthogonal access","proportional fair scheduling","PF scheduling","transmission power control","ICIC method","intercell interference coordination method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6723924","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2013.6723924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2013.6723924","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6723891","publicationTitle":"2013, 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013, 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6713792/6723891/06723924.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inter-cell interference coordination using frequency block dependent transmission power control and PF scheduling in non-orthogonal access with SIC for cellular uplink","abstract":"This paper proposes an inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) method using frequency block-dependent transmission power control (TPC) and proportional fair (PF) scheduling in non-orthogonal access with minimum mean squared error-based linear filtering followed by a successive interference canceller (MMSE-SIC) in the cellular uplink. The proposed method uses TPC coordinated among neighboring cells based on frequency block-dependent parameters. Under this transmission power setting, the use of PF scheduling achieves the ICIC effect. In conventional fractional frequency reuse (FFR) for ICIC in the uplink, users within a cell are categorized into cell-interior and cell-edge user groups and each user group can access only a portion of the frequency blocks. This degrades the multiuser diversity gain and the throughput gain due to non-orthogonal user multiplexing, which is in general increased when the users with largely different channel conditions are multiplexed into the same frequency block. Since all the users within a cell can access all frequency blocks in the proposed method, the method abates the drawbacks of conventional FFR. Simulation results show that non-orthogonal access employing an MMSE-SIC using the proposed ICIC method significantly enhances the system-level throughput performance compared to conventional FFR. We also show the performance gain of non-orthogonal access employing the MMSE-SIC compared to orthogonal access, which is widely used in 3.9 and 4G mobile communication systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6723924/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6723924/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14067741","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Inter-cell interference coordination using frequency block dependent transmission power control and PF scheduling in non-orthogonal access with SIC for cellular uplink","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inter-cell interference coordination using frequency block dependent transmission power control and PF scheduling in non-orthogonal access with SIC for cellular uplink","confLoc":"Carrara, Australia","sourcePdf":"p3katayama.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045976S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6713792","isNumber":"6723891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713792","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6723891","articleId":"6723924","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6723928,"authors":[{"name":"P.

We consider an iterative receiver that can be regarded as a modified turbo equalizer implemented in the frequency-domain where, within each iteration of the equalizer, a decision-directed estimation of the phase noise and its corresponding compensation is performed. The phase noise is modeled considering both its white noise and flicker noise components, thus describing more accurately the phase noise process. Furthermore, regarding the phase noise estimation operation and since it follows the received signal equalization step, the samples at the output of the equalizer can be described by means of an equivalent additive channel allowing us to combine the use of solutions initially proposed for the additive white Gaussian channel (AWGN) with iterative frequency-domain equalization (IFDE) which supports inter-symbol interference (ISI). Consequently, the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator of the phase noise will be adopted, though other solutions could be of choice. Finally, our simulation results show that the proposed scheme performs well even for highly-dispersive channels and moderate phase noise.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase noise","Receivers","Equalizers","Frequency-domain analysis","Bit error rate","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","equalisers","intersymbol interference","maximum likelihood estimation","phase noise","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision directed estimation","phase noise estimation","iterative frequency-domain equalization schemes","phase noise compensation","iterative receiver","modified turbo equalizer","received signal equalization","equivalent additive channel","additive white Gaussian channel","AWGN","iterative frequency domain equalization","IFDE","intersymbol interference","ISI","maximum likelihood estimator","highly dispersive channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SC-FDE","iterative frequency-domain equalization","phase noise","ML estimator"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2013.6723928","publicationTitle":"2013, 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013, 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6713792/6723891/06723928.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6723891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2013.6723928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decision-directed estimation of phase noise in iterative frequency-domain equalization schemes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6723928","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Decision-directed estimation of phase noise in iterative frequency-domain equalization schemes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6723928/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6723928/","accessionNumber":"14061230","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decision-directed estimation of phase noise in iterative frequency-domain equalization schemes","confLoc":"Carrara, Australia","sourcePdf":"p33pedrosa.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051386S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6713792","isNumber":"6723891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713792","xplore-issue":"6723891","articleId":"6723928","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6723929,"authors":[{"name":"Steffen Riess","affiliation":["Institute for Electronics Engineering, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Steffen","lastName":"Riess","id":"38527757500"},{"name":"Johannes Brendel","affiliation":["Institute for Electronics Engineering, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Brendel","id":"38232407400"},{"name":"Georg Fischer","affiliation":["Institute for Electronics Engineering, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Fischer","id":"37288289900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1319-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6723929","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Field programmable gate arrays","Software","Hardware","Generators","Signal processing","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","fast Fourier transforms","field programmable gate arrays","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model-based implementation","power spectral density","FPGA system","cognitive radio","CR systems","spectrum sensing unit","radio frequency spectrum","PSD","spectrum scanner","signal processing","control unit","selectable window functions","fast Fourier transformation","logarithmic representation"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive Radio (CR) systems equipped with a spectrum sensing unit are able to access the radio frequency spectrum in a dynamic manner.

We consider a low priority stream modulated on top of a high priority stream with a constellation ratio a and analyze the resulting BER performance. Since the BER depends in a complex way on the particular precoding matrix used, it is difficult for one to gain direct insight into the performance of the hierarchically modulated system. We overcome this difficulty by resorting to the framework of large system analysis [1] in order to derive the asymptotic expression of the BER of the Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) receiver. Assuming that the entries of the precoding matrix are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) random variables, we derive the limit BER for the 4QAM and the 16QAM low priority stream cases. The limit BER is obtained by assuming that the number of OFDM sub-carriers and the number of OFDM symbols tend to infinity at the same rate. We show that the limit BER is independent of the particular realizations of the precoding matrix. Simulation results show that the asymptotic expression perfectly matches the empirical results obtained for FFT sizes as low as 256 in different channel conditions. We then use the asymptotic expression to gain useful insights into the effect of the different configuration parameters on the system performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic analysis of precoded OFDM with hierarchical modulation","publicationTitle":"2013, 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2013.6723931","displayPublicationTitle":"2013, 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6713792/6723891/06723931.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2013.6723931","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6723891","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6723931","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6723931/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic analysis of precoded OFDM with hierarchical modulation","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6723931/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14061186","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic analysis of precoded OFDM with hierarchical modulation","confLoc":"Carrara, Australia","sourcePdf":"p36mouhouche.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073202S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6713792","isNumber":"6723891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713792","xplore-issue":"6723891","articleId":"6723931","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6723935,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Bluemm","affiliation":["EADS Innovation Works, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Bluemm","id":"37598788000"},{"name":"Christoph Heller","affiliation":["EADS Innovation Works, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Heller","id":"37604283400"},{"name":"Bertille Fourestie","affiliation":["Airbus, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Bertille","lastName":"Fourestie","id":"37086657558"},{"name":"Robert Weigel","affiliation":["University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Weigel","id":"37266288900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1319-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6723935","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":264},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Chirp","Delays","Doppler effect","Equations","Fading","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","optimisation","radio networks","space telemetry","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air-to-ground channel characterization","OFDM communication","C-Band","propagation channel","wireless communication systems","data link development","air-to-ground telemetry","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","channel sounding technique","subcarrier spacing","cyclic prefix"]}],"abstract":"Knowledge of the propagation channel is essential for the design and optimization of wireless communication systems.

This relation is known as the Beam Deviation Factor (BDF). Previously, an equation for the BDF was derived from an aperture phase distribution of a parabolic reflector antenna for feed displacements in the perpendicular plane to the antenna axis. Therefore, the equation gave information for one dimensional feed displacement. In this paper, ray tracings are performed in focal region of a parabolic reflector antenna for incident plane waves. The best feed positions are shown by caustics, which are the concentrated points of all rays. A set of caustic points form a line called locus of caustics. Based on the locus of caustics, the best feed positions are numerically clarified in two dimensional displacements.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2013.6723939","publicationTitle":"2013, 7th International

fuzzy logic movement model in WSN using particle swarm optimization","abstract":"In contrast to adding new nodes, relocation of deployed nodes in mobile wireless sensor networks seems to be an effective solution to cope with undesirable, unpredictable and uncontrolled network topology changes due to nodes' drift and failure. At the price of less global control, there is a trend in recent years towards giving nodes more autonomy and devising localized relocation algorithms to address challenges of network topology control in harsh and hostile environments in the absence of centralized control. Inspired by laws of nature, a large variety of distributed node relocation algorithms have been designed to alleviate undesirable oscillations caused by local interactions and uncertainties among autonomous nodes as they reach their desired formations. Force-based distributed relocation algorithms governed by virtual push-pull forces among autonomous nodes are among such aforesaid algorithms. Adapting fuzzy logic model in exerting proper amount of forces to reduce node movement oscillation seems to be promising as its conforms well with uncertainties and interactions of autonomous nodes. However, parameters of fuzzy logic relocation model should be tuned so to enable nodes to exert proper amount of forces among their in-range neighbours. In this paper, by using particle swarm optimization, parameters of fuzzy relocation model are obtained based on the desired combinations of performance metrics within nodes' range in each movement iteration. The result shows that our model either outperforms or matches DSSA movement model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6723941/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14061209","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6723941/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An iteratively tuned fuzzy logic movement model in WSN using particle swarm optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An iteratively tuned fuzzy logic movement model in WSN using particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Carrara, Australia","sourcePdf":"p445rafiei.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.152341S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6713792","isNumber":"6723891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713792","xplore-issue":"6723891","articleId":"6723941","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6723942,"authors":[{"name":"Arnav Mohan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Arnav","lastName":"Mohan","id":"37086772051"},{"name":"Shankar Prakriya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Shankar","lastName":"Prakriya","id":"37281591400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1319-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6723942","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antennas","Signal to noise ratio","Interference cancellation","Relays","Dynamic spectrum access","Symbiosis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","probability","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic selection mechanisms","DSA system","outage probability","SNR","interference cancellation","secondary users","peak interference control","peak power constraint","secondary systems","user-selection","antenna-selection","symbiotic framework","primary system","SRBS","multiple-antenna secondary base-stations","dynamic spectrum access system"]}],"abstract":"Performance of a dynamic spectrum access system is analyzed for the realistic case when several multiple-antenna secondary base-stations (SRBS) serving their own users exist in the operating region of the primary system. The primary and the secondary systems co-exist in a symbiotic frame-work so that one SRBS opportunistically shares the spectrum with the primary, while another relays the primary signal. The SRBSs employ antenna-selection and user-selection. The secondary systems are assumed to have a peak power constraint, and use peak interference control to limit interference to the PR. The secondary users may employ interference cancellation. It is demonstrated that increasing number of users improves performance at all SNRs, while increasing number of SRBSs improves performance at high SNRs. Interference cancellation is shown to improve performance at low SNR. Expressions are derived for the outage probability of the DSA system. Performance obtained by computer simulations matches with that predicted by the derived expressions.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2013.6723942","displayPublicationTitle":"2013, 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6713792/6723891/06723942.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6723891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2013.6723942","publicationTitle":"2013, 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of dynamic spectrum access with opportunistic selection mechanisms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6723942","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Performance of dynamic spectrum access with opportunistic selection mechanisms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6723942/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6723942/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14067735","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of dynamic spectrum access with opportunistic selection mechanisms","confLoc":"Carrara, Australia","sourcePdf":"p46mohan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055296S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6713792","isNumber":"6723891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713792","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6723891","articleId":"6723942","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6723943,"authors":[{"name":"Ibrahim Khalil Sileh","affiliation":["University of Tikrit, Iraq"],"firstName":"Ibrahim Khalil","lastName":"Sileh","id":"38232978100"},{"name":"Wei Xiang","affiliation":["University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37396484300"},{"name":"Andrew Maxwell","affiliation":["University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Maxwell","id":"37086554018"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1319-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6723943","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","OFDM","Resource management","Protocols","Fading","Signal to noise ratio","Broadband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","codes","cooperative communication","error statistics","OFDM modulation","protocols","relay networks (telecommunication)","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power allocation","distributed space-frequency coding","DSFC","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","hybrid relay selection protocol","cooperative communications","multipath fading mitigation","spectral efficiency","broadband wireless communications systems","resource allocation","relay nodes","channel power gain","bit error rate","BER","capacity performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alamouti code","DSFC","hybrid relay protocol","OFDM","power allocation"]}],"abstract":"Cooperative communications in conjunction with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has recently emerged as a promising technique to mitigate multi-path fading and provides high spectral efficiency in broadband wireless communications systems. In this paper, we investigate resource allocation of an OFDM modulation scheme combined with distributed space-frequency codes (DSFC) based upon a hybrid relay selection protocol. The optimum problem is divided into two suboptimal problems. The first one is to optimize the power allocation between the source and relay nodes under a sum power constraint.

The likelihood ratio test (LRT) statistic, the maximum likelihood (ML) estimates and Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for this problem are all derived and asymptotic analyses of them are carried out for both high and low SNR regimes. These show that in both regimes the ML estimates are naturally approximated by estimators based on sample moments. While the high SNR results confirm standard practice, the low SNR results demonstrate unexpectedly high sensitivity: for an SNR \u03c1 close to zero the analyses of the LRT statistic and CRLB show O(\u03c1\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-4</sup>\n) samples are needed to either reliably detect the presence of a signal or to accurately estimate its parameters. The paper also reviews the iterative method proposed by Li, DiFazio and Zeira (IEEE Commun. Lett. 6(11), pp. 469-471, 2002) for calculating the true ML estimate of SNR: it shows the method to be an instance of the standard bisection algorithm for root finding, and it derives a condition on the sample moments that guarantees existence of a solution and convergence of the algorithm. Finally the paper presents some simulations that compare the iterative scheme with the two standard moment-based estimators and the CRLB: these indicate the widely used M2-M4 estimator based on second and fourth order moments is a good practical choice in many situations.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2013.6723946","publicationTitle":"2013, 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013, 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6713792/6723891/06723946.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2013.6723946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6723891","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-decision-aided detection and SNR estimation of weak BPSK signals in AWGN","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6723946","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Non-decision-aided detection and SNR estimation of weak BPSK signals in AWGN","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6723946/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14061236","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6723946/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-decision-aided detection and SNR estimation of weak BPSK signals in AWGN","confLoc":"Carrara, Australia","sourcePdf":"p50newsam.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076495S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6713792","isNumber":"6723891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713792","xplore-issue":"6723891","articleId":"6723946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6723948,"authors":[{"name":"Ramoni O.

On the other hand, iterative block decision feedback equalization (IB-DFE) based receivers can efficiently exploit the inherent space-frequency diversity of the MIMO MC-CDMA systems. In this paper we combine IA precoding at the transmitter with IB-DFE based processing at the receiver for MC-CDMA systems. The IA precoding is applied at chip level instead of the data symbols level. The receiver is designed in two steps: first an equalizer based on zero forcing (ZF) is used to remove the aligned users' interference, then and after a whitening noise process, an IB-DFE based equalizer is designed to remove the residual inter-carrier interference. Our proposed scheme achieves the maximum degrees of freedom provided by the IA precoding, while allowing a close-to-optimum diversity gain, with performance close to the matched filter bound (MFB).","displayPublicationTitle":"2013, 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6713792/6723891/06723951.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2013, 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2013.6723951","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2013.6723951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6723891","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6723951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint interference alignment and IB-DFE scheme for MC-CDMA systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Equalizers","MIMO","Transmitters","Interference channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","code division multiple access","decision feedback equalisers","MIMO communication","precoding","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference alignment technique","IB-DFE scheme","iterative block decision feedback equalization","IB-DFE based receiver","space-frequency diversity","MIMO MC-CDMA systems","IA precoding","zero forcing","whitening noise process","IB-DFE based equalizer","residual inter-carrier interference","close to optimum diversity gain","matched filter bound"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MC-CDMA systems","interference alignment","precoding","IB-DFE"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6723951/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Joint interference alignment and IB-DFE scheme for MC-CDMA systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6723951/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14061217","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint interference alignment and IB-DFE scheme for MC-CDMA systems","confLoc":"Carrara, Australia","sourcePdf":"p55silva.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047134S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6713792","isNumber":"6723891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713792","xplore-issue":"6723891","articleId":"6723951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6723952,"authors":[{"name":"F\u00e1bio Silva","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"F\u00e1bio","lastName":"Silva","id":"38237645800"},{"name":"Rui Dinis","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Dinis","id":"37269209500"},{"name":"Paulo Montezuma","affiliation":["DEE, FCT-UNL, Portugal"],"firstName":"Paulo","lastName":"Montezuma","id":"37348727400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1319-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6723952","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6723952","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Receivers","Channel estimation","OFDM","Local oscillators","Frequency-domain analysis","Broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast communication","channel estimation","equalisers","modulation","radio networks","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient channel estimation","tracking technique","SC-FDE modulation","single carrier frequency domain equalization","single frequency network broadcasting systems","carrier frequency offset","CFO","local oscillator","receiver structure","equivalent channel variation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we consider the use of Single Carrier Frequency-Domain Equalization (SC-FDE) scheme in Single Frequency Network (SFN) broadcasting systems, with the objective of studying the impact of distinct Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) between the local oscillator at each transmitter and the local oscillator at the receiver.

In the first phase, the relay-to-destination channel is estimated. In the second phase, the destination estimate the far-end channel, i.e., the source-to-relay link, based on the source pilots, relay precoder, and the estimated channel in the first phase. This work aims to conduct a robust design by deriving the optimum source pilots and relay precoder according to the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) criterion. Although the optimization problem can be formulated mathematically; however, the problem is not convex and difficult to be solved. Thus, we replace the objective function with its lower bound, and simplify the matrix optimization problem as a scalar-convex optimization. We show that the optimum solution of the optimization with the lower bound equals to that of the original problem when the channel correlation matrices satisfy certain structures. Simulations show that our proposed method outperforms existing non-robust methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2013.6723954","publicationTitle":"2013, 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013, 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6713792/6723891/06723954.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2013.6723954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6723891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust far-end channel estimation design for MIMO relay systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6723954","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6723954/","displayDocTitle":"Robust far-end channel estimation design for MIMO relay systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14061256","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6723954/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust far-end channel estimation design for MIMO relay systems","confLoc":"Carrara, Australia","sourcePdf":"p58tseng.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121737S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6713792","isNumber":"6723891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713792","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6723891","articleId":"6723954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6723959,"authors":[{"name":"yun-Ho Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"lastName":"yun-Ho Lee","id":"37538532300"},{"name":"oung-Chai Ko","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"lastName":"oung-Chai Ko","id":"37279007700"},{"name":"un Heo","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"lastName":"un Heo","id":"37306786300"},{"name":"oo-Won Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"lastName":"oo-Won Kim"},{"name":"hulwoo Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"lastName":"hulwoo Kim"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1319-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6723959","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Robustness","MIMO","Uncertainty","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","MIMO communication","radio transceivers","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust transceiver","worst-case SINR optimization","MIMO interfering broadcast channels","imperfect channel knowledge","base station","worst-case transceiver design","worst user rate performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO interfering broadcast channels","robust transceiver","imperfect channel knowledge"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a robust transceiver design for MIMO interfering broadcast channels taking imperfect channel knowledge at each base station into consideration.

Extensive experiments have been carried out and iterative decoding thresholds of QC-LDPC codes with the same degree distribution pair but base matrices having different structures and different dimensions have been obtained and compared. Experimental results show that 1) the base matrix structure affects not only the waterfall performance but also the error floor performance; base matrices having good waterfall performance may exhibit rather poor error floor performance. 2) by increasing the dimensions of base matrices for a given degree distribution, the threshold means are reduced while the ranges of threshold distributions are increased. 3) similar to the case of detailed represented LDPC codes, base matrices with sufficiently large dimensions may have thresholds surpassing the conventional ensemble threshold with the same degree distribution pair.

The purpose of this paper is to survey the existing hardware implementations of a face recognition system, particularly those who used for developing an embedded door access control system. This includes a brief discussion about face recognition algorithms and the hardware platforms outlining the importance of using a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device, which can be used to design an embedded door access control system. It is found that the success of any door access control system depends on the type of face recognition algorithm in the feature extraction phase of the face recognition system and the selected hardware device. Based on a comparison between different feature extraction algorithms, the use of a hybrid feature extraction technique can improve the accuracy of face recognition system. An efficient door access control system can be obtained using a FPGA device, which is preferable because of its technical characteristics of parallelism, re-programmability and very high speed, in the implementation of a face recognition system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Embedded door access control systems based on face recognition: A survey","publicationTitle":"2013, 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2013.6723968","displayPublicationTitle":"2013, 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6713792/6723891/06723968.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2013.6723968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6723891","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6723968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6723968/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Embedded door access control systems based on face recognition: A survey","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6723968/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14061192","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embedded door access control systems based on face recognition: A survey","confLoc":"Carrara, Australia","sourcePdf":"p70alshebani.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066223S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6713792","isNumber":"6723891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713792","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6723891","articleId":"6723968","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6723982,"authors":[{"name":"Agur Adams","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, United States of America"],"firstName":"Agur","lastName":"Adams","id":"38064657900"},{"name":"Murali Tummala","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, United States of America"],"firstName":"Murali","lastName":"Tummala","id":"37266477400"},{"name":"John McEachen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, United States of America"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"McEachen","id":"37269349700"},{"name":"James Scrofani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, United States of America"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Scrofani","id":"37424171400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1319-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6723982","dbTime":"33 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Sensors","Kalman filters","Mobile communication","Cognitive radio","Trajectory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","Kalman filters","least mean squares methods","mobility management (mobile radio)","radio tracking","recursive estimation","sensor placement","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["source localization scheme","cognitive radio environment","spatial mobility","source tracking scheme","dynamic opportunistic behavior","extended semirange-based localization scheme","ESRB","communication overhead","wireless sensor network","WSN","nonlinear least squares method","NLSM","mobile CR tracking","brute force","positioning technique","position estimates","Kalman filter","recursive estimator","Matlab programming language"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Source localization and tracking in a Cognitive Radio environment consisting of frequency and spatial mobility","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2013.6723982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6723891","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2013, 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013, 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6713792/6723891/06723982.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2013.6723982","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6723982","abstract":"Source localization and tracking of a Cognitive Radio (CR) is a significant challenge because of the dynamic opportunistic behavior of the radio across the spatial, frequency, and temporal domains. For any localization or tracking scheme to be effective, it must be able to adapt as a CR adapts to its surroundings. The extended semi range-based (ESRB) localization scheme was proposed as a solution to the aforementioned problem, but resulted in considerable communication overhead and storage requirements within the wireless sensor network (WSN) as well as poor reliability due to frequent divergence of the non-linear least squares method (NLSM) in the localization process. Furthermore, tracking a mobile CR was accomplished in a brute force manner by repeating the same positioning technique without taking advantage of prior position estimates. In this paper, the ESRB localization scheme is modified to incorporate the Kalman filter as a recursive estimator to reduce the burden placed on the WSN and integrate an efficient means to estimate the position and velocity of a mobile CR over time. The proposed modification is modeled in the MATLAB programming language, and its efficacy is demonstrated through simulation. It is shown that the Kalman filter is an appropriate recursive estimator for use in the ESRB localization scheme, while accounting for both frequency and spatial mobility inherent in the CR environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6723982/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14061254","htmlLink":"/document/6723982/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Source localization and tracking in a Cognitive Radio environment consisting of frequency and spatial mobility","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Source localization and tracking in a Cognitive Radio environment consisting of frequency and spatial mobility","confLoc":"Carrara, Australia","sourcePdf":"p84adams.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064408S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6713792","isNumber":"6723891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713792","xplore-issue":"6723891","articleId":"6723982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6723990,"authors":[{"name":"Tatsuji Miyamoto","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering Mie University, Tsu-city, Japan"],"firstName":"Tatsuji","lastName":"Miyamoto","id":"37086791246"},{"name":"Katsuhiro Naito","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering Mie University, Tsu-city, Japan"],"firstName":"Katsuhiro","lastName":"Naito","id":"37562415100"},{"name":"Kazuo Mori","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering Mie University, Tsu-city, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuo","lastName":"Mori","id":"37276437300"},{"name":"Hideo Kobayashi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering Mie University, Tsu-city, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideo","lastName":"Kobayashi","id":"37279510000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1319-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6723990","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":491},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Estimation","Doppler effect","Frequency estimation","Accuracy","Correlation","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bessel functions","computational complexity","equalisers","intercarrier interference","least squares approximations","OFDM modulation","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency channel response","OFDM systems","Doppler frequency spread estimation method","autocorrelation function","least squares method","zero order Bessel function","power series","frequency domain equalization","OFDM receiver","carrier-to-noise power ratio","computation complexity","adaptive region selection method","Bessel function approximation","estimation method","inter-carrier interference","ICI noise","Doppler frequency spread estimation methods","CNR estimation method","computation complexity","computer simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Doppler frequency","channel frequency response","autocorrelation","CNR estimation"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a new Doppler frequency spread estimation method based on the time autocorrelation function of channel frequency response (CFR) for OFDM systems. The feature of proposed method is to employ the least squares (LS) method between the zero order Bessel function approximated by the expansion of power series and the estimated time autocorrelation function of using CFR which is indispensable to the frequency domain equalization in the OFDM receiver. In the previously proposed method by the authors, the wider range of approximation for the Bessel function is required to achieve the accurate Doppler frequency estimation especially in the lower carrier-to-noise power ratio (CNR) which leads higher computation complexity for solving the LS equation. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new Doppler estimation method of using an adaptive region selection method for the approximation of Bessel function based on the received CNR. This paper also proposes the estimation method of CNR to be used in the proposed Doppler estimation method. The proposed method can achieve the accurate estimation of noise power at the receiver even when the received signal includes larger inter-carrier interference (ICI) noise due to the higher Doppler frequency spread. The proposed Doppler frequency spread estimation methods in conjunction with the CNR estimation method can achieve the higher estimation accuracy even under the lower CNR with lower computation complexity. This paper presents various computer simulation results to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proposal of Doppler estimation method of using frequency channel response for OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"2013, 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS.2013.6723990","displayPublicationTitle":"2013, 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6713792/6723891/06723990.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS.2013.6723990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6723891","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6723990","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6723990/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Proposal of Doppler estimation method of using frequency channel response for OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6723990/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14061193","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proposal of Doppler estimation method of using frequency channel response for OFDM systems","confLoc":"Carrara, Australia","sourcePdf":"p92miyamoto.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088426S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6713792","isNumber":"6723891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713792","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6723891","articleId":"6723990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6723993,"authors":[{"name":"Aiping Huang","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technology, The Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Aiping","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086212664"},{"name":"Jinhong Yuan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"lastName":"Jinhong Yuan","id":"37087170337"},{"name":"Yangyu Fan","affiliation":["Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Yangyu","lastName":"Fan","id":"37088012782"},{"name":"Linwei Tao","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technology, The Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Linwei Tao","id":"37088015024"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1319-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6723993","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6723993","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Optical pulses","Adaptive optics","Optical modulation","Fading","Optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric turbulence","error statistics","fading channels","optical links","pulse position modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flag dual amplitude pulse position modulation","atmospheric FSO communication","FDAPPM","free space optical system","atmospheric turbulence","fading channel","receiver complexity","built-in symbol synchronization","symbol structure","transmission rate","conditional pairwise error probability","gamma-gamma turbulence","Meijer G-function","asymptotic bit error probability"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel flag dual amplitude pulse position modulation (FDAPPM) for free space optical (FSO) systems in atmospheric turbulence-induced fading channels.

However, these two aspects are contradicting and quite impossible to solve the placement problem with a single optimal decision. Thus, a Multi-objective Optimization (MOO) approach is needed to facilitate this. This paper studies the performance of a WSN sensor node placement problem solved with a new biologically inspired optimization technique that imitates the behavior of territorial predators in marking their territories with their odours known as Territorial Predator Scent Marking Algorithm (TPSMA). The simulation study is done for a single objective and multi-objective approaches. The MOO approach of TPSMA (MOTPSMA) deployed in this paper uses the minimum energy consumption and maximum coverage as the objective functions while the single objective approach TPSMA only considers maximum coverage. The performance of both approaches is then compared in terms of coverage ratio and total energy consumption. Simulation results show that the WSN deployed with the MOTPSMA is able to reduce the energy consumption although the coverage ratio is slightly lower than single approach TPSMA which only focuses on maximizing the coverage.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6723994/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14061222","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6723994/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective Optimization (MOO) approach for sensor node placement in WSN","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective Optimization (MOO) approach for sensor node placement in WSN","confLoc":"Carrara, Australia","sourcePdf":"p96zainolabidin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06413S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6713792","isNumber":"6723891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713792","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6723891","articleId":"6723994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6724004,"authors":[{"name":"Ken-ichi Kitayama","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Ken-ichi Kitayama received the M.E. and Dr. Eng. degrees in communication engineering all from Osaka University, Osaka, Japan, in 1976 and 1981, respectively.","In 1976, he joined the NTT Electrical Communication Laboratory.

The architecture is based on on-chip wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) that, in conjunction with the frequency-periodic response of optical ring resonator (ORR) filters, dramatically reduces the network complexity and, in turn, its area occupation on the wafer. This allows the integration of an unprecedented number of delay channels on a single chip, overcoming the main limitation of current integrated beamformers, that is, the limited capability to feed very large arrays when using a single chip.

In addition to the signal fading due to fiber dispersion, another cyclic variation of signal amplitude that depends on the modulation depth has been theoretically predicted in the literature (Reference [2]). To confirm the prediction experimentally, we set up a RoF link transmitting a 16-QAM microwave signal, and observed the change in the constellation map of the QAM signal. The optical signal was prepared by modulating the output of a distributed feedback-laser diode using a lithium-niobate intensity modulator. When the modulation depth was small, the constellation maps after the transmission experienced degradation in their signal-to-noise ratio, but any other significant change was not observed. If we employed a large modulation depth, however, outer symbols in the constellation map moved slightly outwards as the signal propagated down the fiber. If we eliminated harmonic sidebands using an optical filter, the movement of the outer symbols is relaxed compared with the unfiltered case. From these results, we could confirm the prediction in the literature that the movement of the outer symbols was due to the beat between the fundamental and the second-harmonic sidebands, the relative phases between which were shifted due to fiber dispersion.","doi":"10.1109/MWP.2013.6724040","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWP.2013.6724040","startPage":"142","endPage":"145","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Topical Meeting on Microwave Photonics (MWP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6712976/6723996/06724040.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Topical Meeting on Microwave Photonics (MWP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6723996","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evidence of modulation-dependent fading of signal amplitude due to fiber dispersion in radio-over-fiber transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Evidence of modulation-dependent fading of signal amplitude due to fiber dispersion in radio-over-fiber transmission","conferenceDate":"28-31 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6724040/","accessionNumber":"14060799","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724040/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evidence of modulation-dependent fading of signal amplitude due to fiber dispersion in radio-over-fiber transmission","confLoc":"Alexandria, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"038048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044487S","chronDate":"28-31 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6712976","isNumber":"6723996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6712976","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6723996","articleId":"6724040","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6724058,"authors":[{"name":"Tongyun Li","affiliation":["Electrical Division, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, U.K."],"firstName":"Tongyun","lastName":"Li","id":"37677512900"},{"name":"Michael Crisp","affiliation":["Electrical Division, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, U.K."],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Crisp","id":"37318727600"},{"name":"Richard V.

Specifically, phase-shift-only transmit beamforming and antenna selection are compared. It is found that for two typical indoor propagation scenarios, both strategies offer double the capacity gain that non-precoding MIMO DAS offers over traditional MIMO collocated antenna systems (CAS), with capacity improvements of 3.2-4.2 bit/s/Hz. Further, antenna selection shows similar performance to phase-only beamforming, differing by <;0.5% and offering median capacities of 94 bit/s/Hz and 82 bit/s/Hz in the two propagation scenarios respectively. Because optical DASs enable precise, centralized control of remote antennas, they are well suited for implementing these beamforming schemes. Antenna selection, in particular, is a simple and effective means of increasing MIMO DAS capacity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724084/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14060812","htmlLink":"/document/6724084/","conferenceDate":"28-31 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Experimental investigation of antenna selection and transmit beamforming for capacity enhancement in 3\u00d73 MIMO-enabled radio-over-fiber DAS","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental investigation of antenna selection and transmit beamforming for capacity enhancement in 3\u00d73 MIMO-enabled radio-over-fiber DAS","confLoc":"Alexandria, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"082135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064758S","chronDate":"28-31 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6712976","isNumber":"6723996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6712976","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6723996","articleId":"6724084","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6724102,"authors":[{"name":"Yifeng Cai","affiliation":["Huazhong University of Science and Technology"],"bio":{"p":["Yifeng Cai (cyf@hust.edu.cn) received his B.S degree from Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China in 2009.

To achieve higher sensing accuracy, cognitive radio systems often require cooperation among secondary users. One of the most important aspects in collaborative spectrum sensing is the data fusion algorithm which combines the sensing results from secondary users to produce the final channel status hypothesis. However, plenty of factors may affect the performance of certain data fusion rule, for example, the individual sensing node's sensing accuracy, the number of involved nodes, and the like. If Spectrum Sensing Data Falsification (SSDF) attack exists, it will become more challenging to make proper data fusion. In this article, we first introduce framework, and then evaluate the data fusion rules in different scenarios through simulation examples. Finally, a Genetic Algorithm based optimal scheme is proposed to achieve better performance in all scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/MNET.2014.6724102","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","pdfPath":"/iel7/65/6724095/06724102.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MNET.2014.6724102","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","startPage":"17","endPage":"23","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal data fusion of collaborative spectrum sensing under attack in cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724102","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"January-February  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Optimal data fusion of collaborative spectrum sensing under attack in cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724102/","volume":"28","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6724102/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January-February 2014","accessionNumber":"14057382","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal data fusion of collaborative spectrum sensing under attack in cognitive radio networks","sourcePdf":"007MO_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085206S","chronDate":"January-February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"65","isNumber":"6724095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6724095","articleId":"6724102","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6724103,"authors":[{"name":"Weixiao Meng","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology"],"bio":{"p":["Weixiao Meng (wxmeng@hit.edu.cn) received his B.

It identifies the IVR substrates (e.g. key detector, voice recorder and dialog manager) on which the IVR applications rely and proposes at the IaaS level an IVR substrate virtualization infrastructure. Substrates' virtualization enables a more efficient resource usage, a key benefit inherent to cloud computing. The article also proposes at the PaaS level an accompanying platform to develop and manage the IVR applications which use the identified virtualized substrates. A few typical IVR applications are also developed and managed to illustrate the SaaS facet of cloud computing.

This work proposes a methodology to overcome all the weakness of single layer intrusion detection. In this work, a layered approach for intrusion detection is proposed which is based on genetic algorithm. In this model, the four layers correspond to four attack groups. They are Probe, DOS, R2L and U2R attacks. But in this approach, there is no mathematical method for calculating filter parameters for DOS, R2L, U2R attacks. So, we present a new approach which is genetic algorithm based, for calculating those parameters to make the system more secure. This efficiently detect R2L attack and 90 % accuracy detected.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIC.2013.6724120","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIC.2013.6724120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724108","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research","pdfPath":"/iel7/6713383/6724108/06724120.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Layered approach for intrusion detection systems based genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724120/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Layered approach for intrusion detection systems based genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6724120/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14060994","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"26-28 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Dec. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Layered approach for intrusion detection systems based genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Enathi, India","sourcePdf":"ICCIC1300070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083963S","chronDate":"26-28 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6713383","isNumber":"6724108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713383","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6724108","articleId":"6724120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6724122,"authors":[{"name":"Tushar V.

In this brief, we propose high speed and area efficient 64 point FFT processor using Vedic algorithm. To reduce computational complexity and area, we develop FFT architecture by devising a radix-4 algorithm and optimizing the realization by Vedic algorithm. Furthermore, it can be used in decimation in frequency (DIF) and decimation in time (DIT) decompositions. Moreover, the design can achieve very high speed, which makes them suitable for the most demanding applications of FFT. Indeed, the proposed radix-4 Vedic algorithm based architecture requires fewer hardware resources. The synthesis results are same as that of theoretical analysis and it is observed that more than 15% reduction can be achieved in terms of slices count. In addition, the dynamic power consumption can be reduced and speed can be increased by as much as 16% using Vedic algorithm.","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research","pdfPath":"/iel7/6713383/6724108/06724122.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIC.2013.6724122","doi":"10.1109/ICCIC.2013.6724122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of FFT processor using vedic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of FFT processor using vedic algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724122/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6724122/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14061033","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Dec. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of FFT processor using vedic algorithm","confLoc":"Enathi, India","sourcePdf":"ICCIC1300076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080928S","chronDate":"26-28 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6713383","isNumber":"6724108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713383","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6724108","articleId":"6724122","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6724124,"authors":[{"name":"J.

However area and speed are two most important constraints. So improving speed results always in larger area. So here we try to find out the best solution among the both of them. In order to reduce the hardware which ultimately reduces an area and power, Energy Efficient full adders plays an important role in Wallace tree multiplier. Reduced Complexity Wallace multiplier (RCWM) will have fewer adders than Standard Wallace multiplier (SWM). A Reduced Complexity Wallace multiplier presented in this paper is having the same delay as that of Standard Wallace multipliers. In both multipliers, at the last stage Carry Propagating Adder (CPA) is used. This paper proposes use of Energy Efficient CMOS full adder in reduced complexity Wallace Multiplier at the place of Full adder of standard Wallace Multiplier in order to reduce Area, Power and improvement in speed. The Reduced complexity reduction method smartly reduces the number of half adders with 70-80% reduction in an area of half adders than standard Wallace multipliers.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Energy efficiency","CMOS integrated circuits","Logic gates","Complexity theory","Standards","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","CMOS integrated circuits","digital signal processing chips","FIR filters","multiplying circuits","trees (mathematics)","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS full adder","VLSI implementation","microprocessors","FIR filter","digital signal processors","Wallace tree multiplier","reduced complexity Wallace multiplier","RCWM","carry propagating adder","CPA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy Efficient full adders","CMOS full adder","Wallace Multiplier","High speed multiplier"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724141","doi":"10.1109/ICCIC.2013.6724141","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research","pdfPath":"/iel7/6713383/6724108/06724141.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIC.2013.6724141","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724141/","displayDocTitle":"VLSI implementation of reduced complexity wallace multiplier using energy efficient CMOS full adder","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14061041","htmlLink":"/document/6724141/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Dec. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI implementation of reduced complexity wallace multiplier using energy efficient CMOS full adder","confLoc":"Enathi, India","sourcePdf":"ICCIC1300134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052698S","chronDate":"26-28 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6713383","isNumber":"6724108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713383","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6724108","articleId":"6724141","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6724151,"authors":[{"name":"Saurabh Kumar","affiliation":["University College of Engineering, Rajasthan Technical University, Kota, India"],"firstName":"Saurabh","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37086655749"},{"name":"Rajesh Bhatt","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University College of Engineering, Kota, India"],"firstName":"Rajesh","lastName":"Bhatt","id":"37086068414"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1597-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1594-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1595-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6724151","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":218},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724151","abstract":"In this paper, design method for closed-loop auto-tuning of a PID controller based on the Multi-Objective Ant Algorithm (MOAA) is proposed.

Congestion management becomes the major issue for the Independent System Operator to handle as the transmission corridor will be exploited by both the buyers and sellers for their own interests. Generation from different power utility will be contracted to flow in the transmission network as per different buyers' requirements, which may create overloading of some of the transmission resources. Congestion thus created or created while planning for any contingency is mitigated by generation rescheduling or load curtailment or both.

This computing utility will offer the basic level of computing service that can be considered essential to meet the everyday needs of the general community. A new model of computing called cloud computing is transforming computing to a model consisting of services that are treated as commodities and delivered in a manner like the traditional utilities. In this model, the services are accessed by the user based on their requirements without the knowledge of the place where these services are hosted or how these services are delivered. The data mining when offered in cloud computing environment allows e-commerce organizations a centralised management of software and data storage, with assurance of efficient, reliable and secure services for their users thus achieving maximized profit and cutting costs in different possible ways. In this paper we discuss how cloud computing is changing the computing scenario and how Web data mining can be used in cloud computing by the e-commerce organizations to reduce setup costs and maximize return on investments.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIC.2013.6724234","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research","pdfPath":"/iel7/6713383/6724108/06724234.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIC.2013.6724234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mining the E-commerce cloud: A survey on emerging relationship between web mining, E-commerce and cloud computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724234","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724234/","displayDocTitle":"Mining the E-commerce cloud: A survey on emerging relationship between web mining, E-commerce and cloud computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14061025","conferenceDate":"26-28 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mining the E-commerce cloud: A survey on emerging relationship between web mining, E-commerce and cloud computing","confLoc":"Enathi, India","sourcePdf":"ICCIC1300346.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065494S","chronDate":"26-28 Dec. 2013","isNumber":"6724108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713383","citationCount":"5","articleId":"6724234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6724239,"authors":[{"name":"B.

It also improves the communication bandwidth and thereby decreases the reconfiguration time in FPGA. Existing research in this field has explored two directions: efficient compression with slow decompression or fast decompression at the cost of compression efficiency. There are two major challenges in bit stream compression. They are, compressing the bit stream as much as possible and efficiently decompressing the bit stream without affecting the reconfiguration time. The three major contributions of this project are:1) Smart placement of compressed bit streams that can significantly decrease the overhead of decompression engine, 2) Selection of profitable parameters for bit stream compression, 3) Efficient combination of bitmask-based compression and Golomb encoding of non-repetitive patterns. The decompression hardware for variable-length coding is capable of operating at the speed closest to the best known field-programmable gate array-based decoder for fixed-length coding.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIC.2013.6724256","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research","pdfPath":"/iel7/6713383/6724108/06724256.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIC.2013.6724256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724108","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit stream compression used for FPGA using Golomb coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724256","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bit stream compression used for FPGA using Golomb coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724256/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14061059","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6724256/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit stream compression used for FPGA using Golomb coding","confLoc":"Enathi, India","sourcePdf":"ICCIC1300391.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033162S","chronDate":"26-28 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6713383","isNumber":"6724108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713383","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6724108","articleId":"6724256","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6724257,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Cognitive Radio is an intelligent wireless communication technique in order to increase the spectrum efficiency and fairness issues. Cognitive radio is proposed as promising solutions for increasing spectrum utilization. Cross layer design recently become the new hype in wireless communication system. It is cooperation between multiple layers to combine the resources. Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) is a potential solution to minimize the co channel interference where cognitive radio operating in coexisting environment. However two algorithms are proposed to improve spectrum sensing capability in cognitive radio network that is energy detection and cyclostationary algorithms. Both detection methods are used to determine the presence of primary signals over a range of frequencies has been found based on the energy levels of various frequencies crossing the threshold. Cyclostationary detection exploits the periodicity in the received primary signal to identify the presence of PUs.

In our paper, top-ten classification algorithms namely J48, BayesNet, Logistic, SGD, IBK, JRip, PART, Random Forest, Random Tree and REPTree were selected after experimenting with more than twenty most widely used classification algorithms. The comparison of these top-ten classification algorithms is presented in this paper based upon their performance metrics to find out the best suitable algorithm available. Performance of the classification models is measured using 10-fold cross validation. Experiments and assessments of these methods are performed in WEKA environment using NSL-KDD dataset.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparative Study of Classification Techniques for Intrusion Detection","publicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Computational and Business Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/ISCBI.2013.16","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Computational and Business Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/6657191/6724301/06724320.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"43","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCBI.2013.16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724301","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724320","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724320/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Comparative Study of Classification Techniques for Intrusion Detection","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6724320/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14057484","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparative Study of Classification Techniques for Intrusion Detection","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"5066a040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058271S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6657191","isNumber":"6724301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6657191","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6724301","articleId":"6724320","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6724328,"authors":[{"name":"Varun Kumar Ojha","affiliation":["Department of Computer & System Sciences, Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan, India"],"firstName":"Varun Kumar","lastName":"Ojha","id":"37085373546"},{"name":"Paramartha Dutta","affiliation":["Department of Computer & System Sciences, Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan, India"],"firstName":"Paramartha","lastName":"Dutta","id":"37429446600"},{"name":"Atal Chaudhuri","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata"],"firstName":"Atal","lastName":"Chaudhuri","id":"37348544500"},{"name":"Hiranmay Saha","affiliation":["Center of Excellence for Green Energy and Sensors System, Bengal Engineering & Science University, Shibpur, India"],"firstName":"Hiranmay","lastName":"Saha","id":"37296132500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5066-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6724328","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of Various Conjugate Gradient Based ANN Training Methods for Designing Intelligent Manhole Gas Detection System","abstract":"Human fatality occurs due to presence of excessive proportion of toxic gases such as Ammonia (NH3), Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S), Methane (CH4), and Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) in manholes.

Video on demand (VoD) is a very popular present day service. It is a well-known fact, that video on demand internet service needs a large amount of bandwidth. CR WMNs is envisaged to provide the much needed bandwidth for video streaming as CR WMNs has the ability to access a large part of the under-utilized licensed spectrum. In CR WMNs interference is a critical issue which degrades cognitive radio wireless mesh networks (CR WMNs) performance. As the number of users rises, interference also increases resulting in low throughput. In this paper first an analytical model for CR WMNs has been presented. We have also presented an efficient VoD model and an optimizing approach which minimizes interference to provide a much needed higher network capacity to VoD services. Simulation results show effectiveness of our proposed approach as there is an increase in the number of concurrent VoD sessions.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCBI.2013.53","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724301","startPage":"231","endPage":"234","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Computational and Business Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/6657191/6724301/06724358.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Video on Demand System over Cognitive Radio Wireless Mesh Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724358/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6724358/","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Video on Demand System over Cognitive Radio Wireless Mesh Networks","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14057483","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Video on Demand System over Cognitive Radio Wireless Mesh Networks","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"5066a231.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070628S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6657191","isNumber":"6724301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6657191","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6724301","articleId":"6724358","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6724367,"authors":[{"name":"K.V.

The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a general purpose stochastic algorithm mimicking the behaviors of particles self-organizing a system. The size of solution space is very large in the 3D component placement problem and it is afraid that the objective function value will be degraded. The Clustering Algorithm (CA) is an efficient initial placement algorithm and this algorithm is used for partitioning the placement problem into clusters with the total pseudo wire-length minimization. PSO is applied to each of the clusters for determining the detailed placement of components with the acceleration as well as the objective function optimization. This hybrid PSO (CA-PSO) is experimentally evaluated against a component placement problem of actual printed wiring board consisting of 217 components and 462 nets and the results show its feasibility.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724391/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14061274","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6724391/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"12-15 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A hybrid particle swarm optimization for component placement in 3D IC design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid particle swarm optimization for component placement in 3D IC design","confLoc":"Nara, Japan","sourcePdf":"OS13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073167S","chronDate":"12-15 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6713793","isNumber":"6724381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713793","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6724381","articleId":"6724391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6724397,"authors":[{"name":"Yoh Iijima","affiliation":["Shibaura Institute of Technology, Koto-ku, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoh","lastName":"Iijima","id":"37086796206"},{"name":"Toshio Sudo","affiliation":["Shibaura Institute of Technology, Koto-ku, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshio","lastName":"Sudo","id":"38551667600"},{"name":"Tomohiro Kinoshita","affiliation":["R&D Division, Panasonic Corporation"],"firstName":"Tomohiro","lastName":"Kinoshita","id":"37086667306"},{"name":"Kazuhide Uriu","affiliation":["Panasonic Corporation, Automotive & Industrial Systems Company"],"firstName":"Kazuhide","lastName":"Uriu","id":"38557103800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2311-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2313-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2151-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-1233"}],"articleNumber":"6724397","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":201},"abstract":"Simultaneous switching noise (SSN) is a serious design issue to stabilize power supply integrity and logic operation in advanced CMOS circuits and systems.

paper. Due to the prohibitive cost of solving a dense algebraic system formed by MoM, linear complexity fast solver algorithms have been developed in the past to expedite the matrix-vector product computation in a Krylov sub-space based iterative solver framework. However, as the number of conductors in a system increases leading to a corresponding increase in the number of right-hand-side (RHS) vectors, the computational cost for multiple matrix-vector products present a time bottleneck, especially for ill-conditioned system matrices. In this work, an FPGA based hardware implementation is proposed to parallelize the iterative matrix solution for multiple RHS vectors in a low-rank compression based fast solver scheme. The method is applied to accelerate electrostatic parasitic capacitance extraction of multiple conductors in a Ball Grid Array (BGA) package. Speed-ups up to 13\u00d7 over equivalent software implementation on an Intel Core i5 processor for dense matrix-vector products and 12\u00d7 for QR compressed matrix-vector products is achieved using a Virtex-6 XC6VLX240T FPGA on Xilinx's ML605 board.","doi":"10.1109/EDAPS.2013.6724399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDAPS.2013.6724399","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Electrical Design of Advanced Packaging Systems Symposium (EDAPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Electrical Design of Advanced Packaging Systems Symposium (EDAPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6713793/6724381/06724399.pdf","startPage":"100","endPage":"103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724381","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724399/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Hardware accelerator for 3D method of moments based parasitic extraction","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14126340","htmlLink":"/document/6724399/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware accelerator for 3D method of moments based parasitic extraction","confLoc":"Nara, Japan","sourcePdf":"OS32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050521S","chronDate":"12-15 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6713793","isNumber":"6724381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713793","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6724381","articleId":"6724399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6724405,"authors":[{"name":"Yuta Inoue","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electronics, Shizuoka University, Hamamatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuta","lastName":"Inoue","id":"37404527400"},{"name":"Hideki Asai","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electronics, Shizuoka University, Hamamatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideki","lastName":"Asai","id":"37283278100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2311-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2313-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2151-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-1233"}],"articleNumber":"6724405","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Graphics processing units","Mathematical model","Equations","Time-domain analysis","Data communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic fields","finite difference time-domain analysis","graphics processing units"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiGPU hybrid implicit-explicit finite-difference time-domain","multiGPU HIE-FDTD method","large-scale electromagnetic problems","time step size","parallel computing","local matrix operations","electromagnetic field simulation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, Multi-GPU hybrid implicit-explicit finite-difference time-domain (HIE-FDTD) method is proposed for the solution of large-scale electromagnetic problems.

The cooling effect of this structure with the Peltier module is investigated with thermal simulation.","doi":"10.1109/EDAPS.2013.6724409","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Electrical Design of Advanced Packaging Systems Symposium (EDAPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Electrical Design of Advanced Packaging Systems Symposium (EDAPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6713793/6724381/06724409.pdf","startPage":"142","endPage":"145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDAPS.2013.6724409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal analysis of a cooling module for an image sensor with thermally isolated pixel area","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724409","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724409/","displayDocTitle":"Thermal analysis of a cooling module for an image sensor with thermally isolated pixel area","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14061316","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6724409/","conferenceDate":"12-15 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal analysis of a cooling module for an image sensor with thermally isolated pixel area","confLoc":"Nara, Japan","sourcePdf":"OS53.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072758S","chronDate":"12-15 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6713793","isNumber":"6724381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713793","xplore-issue":"6724381","articleId":"6724409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6724416,"authors":[{"name":"Yuya Shirahashi","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Shizuoka University, Shizuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuya","lastName":"Shirahashi","id":"37086782216"},{"name":"Minoru Watanabeu","affiliation":["Shizuoka Daigaku, Shizuoka, JP"],"firstName":"Minoru","lastName":"Watanabeu"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2311-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2313-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2151-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-1233"}],"articleNumber":"6724416","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Many-module redundancy implementation of mono instruction set computers for 3D optical FPGAs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724416","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Packaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","instruction sets","reconfigurable architectures","redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["programmable devices","space applications","hardware repair functions","hardware update functions","hardware acceleration","optically reconfigurable gate array","ORGA","robust multicontext field programmable gate array","corrupt configuration data","nanosecond-order reconfiguration speed","monoinstruction set computer architecture","highspeed dynamic reconfiguration","many-module redundancy","triple module redundancy","TMR"]}],"abstract":"Demand for programmable devices for space applications is increasing day-by-day to support hardware repair functions, hardware update functions, and hardware acceleration for space systems. An optically reconfigurable gate array (ORGA) has been developed as a robust multi-context field programmable gate array that is quite suitable for such space applications. The ORGA can be reconfigured using corrupt configuration data with nanosecond-order reconfiguration speed. Currently, we also propose a mono-instruction set computer architecture exploiting the high-speed dynamic reconfiguration. Using the mono-instruction set computer architecture, many-module redundancy over triple module redundancy (TMR) can be realized.

At the same time, a computational domain without the ESD generator is analyzed by means of the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The results from the SPICE-like and FDTD simulations are exchanged for each other by using analogy between the circuit theory and electromagnetics. The proposed method can reduce the computational cost significantly because we perform the FDTD simulation only for the reduced domain, which is much smaller than the whole domain. The adequacy of the proposed method is verified by comparing simulation results with measurement results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Electrical Design of Advanced Packaging Systems Symposium (EDAPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6713793/6724381/06724423.pdf","startPage":"197","endPage":"200","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Electrical Design of Advanced Packaging Systems Symposium (EDAPS)","doi":"10.1109/EDAPS.2013.6724423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDAPS.2013.6724423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724381","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid simulation of ESD events by SPICE-like and finite-difference time-domain methods","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","Electrostatic discharges","Generators","Finite difference methods","Computational modeling","Time-domain analysis","Discharges (electric)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit simulation","electrostatic discharge","equivalent circuits","finite difference time-domain analysis","printed circuits","SPICE"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid simulation","electrostatic discharge","ESD events","SPICE-like method","finite difference time-domain method","electromagnetic simulation","transient simulation","equivalent circuit","circuit theory","electromagnetics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["contact discharge mode","electrostatic discharge (ESD)","finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method","hybrid simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724423/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid simulation of ESD events by SPICE-like and finite-difference time-domain methods","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6724423/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14061319","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"12-15 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid simulation of ESD events by SPICE-like and finite-difference time-domain methods","confLoc":"Nara, Japan","sourcePdf":"P1P12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059781S","chronDate":"12-15 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6713793","isNumber":"6724381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713793","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6724381","articleId":"6724423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6724430,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuma Shibasaka","affiliation":["Graduate school of Systems and Information Engineering, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Janan"],"firstName":"Kazuma","lastName":"Shibasaka","id":"37086706255"},{"name":"Kenji Kanazawa","affiliation":["Graduate school of Systems and Information Engineering, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Janan"],"firstName":"Kenji","lastName":"Kanazawa","id":"37299279800"},{"name":"Montoshi Yasunaga","affiliation":["Graduate school of Systems and Information Engineering, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Janan"],"firstName":"Montoshi","lastName":"Yasunaga","id":"37281962000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2311-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2313-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2151-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-1233"}],"articleNumber":"6724430","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Packaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","genetic algorithms","integrated circuit modelling","large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoupling capacitor allocation problem","genetic algorithm","LSI","power integrity","power distribution network","PDN","power plane","allocation target area","power voltage standing waves","combinatorial explosion problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decoupling capacitor","power plane","genetic algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724430","abstract":"Decoupling capacitors allocated closely to LSIs work well in order to increase PI (power integrity) in PDNs (power distribution networks).

This allocation problem becomes a combinatorial explosion problem, which has no deterministic solving approach. We apply the GA to this problem, and also propose a novel chromosome suits to the power plain structure.

optimization based feature selection in mammogram mass classification","abstract":"Mammography is currently the most effective method for early detection of breast cancer. This paper proposes an effective technique to classify regions of interests (ROIs) of digitized mammograms into mass and normal tissue regions by first finding the significant texture features of ROI using binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO). The data set used consisted of sixty-nine ROIs from the MIAS Mini-Mammographic database. Eighteen texture features were derived from the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) of each ROI. Significant features are found by a feature selection technique based on BPSO. The decision tree classifier is then used to classify the test set using these significant features. Experimental results show that the significant texture features found by the BPSO based feature selection technique can have better classification accuracy when compared to the full set of features. The BPSO feature selection technique also has similar or better performance in classification accuracy when compared to other widely used existing techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-18 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724487/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14057410","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6724487/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","conferenceDate":"17-18 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Particle swarm optimization based feature selection in mammogram mass classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle swarm optimization based feature selection in mammogram mass classification","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"PID2609103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07619S","chronDate":"17-18 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6595335","isNumber":"6724457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6595335","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6724457","articleId":"6724487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6724501,"authors":[{"name":"Irfan Simsek","affiliation":["Computer Networking Technology Group, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany"],"firstName":"Irfan","lastName":"Simsek","id":"37085485863"},{"name":"Martin Becke","affiliation":["Computer Networking Technology Group, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Becke","id":"37946012900"},{"name":"Yves Igor Jerschow","affiliation":["Computer Networking Technology Group, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany"],"firstName":"Yves Igor","lastName":"Jerschow","id":"37888175300"},{"name":"Erwin P.

In these approaches in-network services require access to various control data signalled in different ways to utilise the complete functionality of the orchestrated network. The diversity and amount of required control data rises progressively so that the communication endpoints have to allow more and more access to information about themselves. To ensure information confidentiality and integrity for two communicating end points, the de facto method applied so far is end-to-end encryption of information transferred between the two end points. However, in-network services have then no longer access to the encrypted control data and they cannot accomplish their tasks anymore. Thus, we can either ensure information security or establish smart in-network services. Our paper focuses on this dilemma and introduces an approach where we redesign the smart in-network services to blind but still smart ones that can still correctly process masked control data by using a new kind of cryptographic algorithms. The feasibility of our approach is demonstrated by redesigning the packet forwarding service to a blind one. Additionally, we present our prototype implementation of the blind packet forwarding and evaluate it.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724495","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NOF.2013.6724501","publicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on the Network of the Future (NoF)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on the Network of the Future (NoF)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6708498/6724495/06724501.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/NOF.2013.6724501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A clean-slate security vision for future networks: Simultaneously ensuring information security and establishing smart in-network services using the example of blind packet forwarding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A clean-slate security vision for future networks: Simultaneously ensuring information security and establishing smart in-network services using the example of blind packet forwarding","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6724501/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14067706","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724501/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A clean-slate security vision for future networks: Simultaneously ensuring information security and establishing smart in-network services using the example of blind packet forwarding","confLoc":"Pohang, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"TS13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060321S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6708498","isNumber":"6724495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6708498","xplore-issue":"6724495","articleId":"6724501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6724540,"authors":[{"name":"Geoffrey Yeap","affiliation":["Qualcomm Technologies Inc., San Diego, CA"],"firstName":"Geoffrey","lastName":"Yeap","id":"37331032700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2306-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-017X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0163-1918"}],"articleNumber":"6724540","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1780},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724540","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","System-on-chip","Radio frequency","Silicon","Transistors","Smart phones","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","mobile handsets","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["production ramp","mobile system-on-chips","smart mobile wireless devices","technology trend","semiconductor industry","smart mobile SoC","reduced form factor","system partitioning","multidie integration","RFFE system integration","energy-efficient interconnects","energy-efficient memories","energy-efficient transistors","mobile heterogeneous computing","orthogonal system scaling","battery life","silicon technology scaling","size 28 nm","size 20 nm","size 16 nm","size 14 nm","size 10 nm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IEDM.2013.6724540","endPage":"1.3.8","startPage":"1.3.1","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/6709840/6724533/06724540.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.2013.6724540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart mobile SoCs driving the semiconductor industry: Technology trend, challenges and opportunities","abstract":"The explosive growth of smart mobile wireless devices in recent years has fundamentally transformed the semiconductor industry. Mobile system-on-chips (SoCs) has become the leading product driver for technology definition and manufacturing for the semiconductor industry. This trend was first observed in 28 nm and will continue for 20 nm, 16/14 nm, and 10 nm adoption and production ramp. Recent mobile SoC performance increase was achieved mainly through silicon technology scaling, and from single to dual- and quad-core. For mobile SoCs to continue offering new and exciting user-experiences, and longer battery life, a holistic approach in orthogonal system scaling to break out of the box of (speed*density/power/cost) constrains is mandated. Examples in the new paradigm of mobile heterogeneous computing are: energy-efficient transistors/memories/interconnects in expanding and boosting existing SoC functionalities (e.g., SiGe/III-V FinFET, GAA-FET, TFET, and RRAM/MRAM etc.), all-inclusive technology/design co-optimization to extract more values from silicon tech, RFFE system integration, and the multi-die integration by system partitioning that allows each component to be optimized and integrated closely together for lower cost and power, higher performance, and reduced form factor. Numerous challenges are ahead yet tremendous opportunities exist for collaborative and multiplicative innovations in the industry to enable the continued growth of mobile SoCs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724540/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6724540/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14062140","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Smart mobile SoCs driving the semiconductor industry: Technology trend, challenges and opportunities","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart mobile SoCs driving the semiconductor industry: Technology trend, challenges and opportunities","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"s01p03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060304S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6709840","isNumber":"6724533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6709840","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6724533","articleId":"6724540","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6724549,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In the proposed p-MTJ structure, all tunnel barriers and free layers lie under a thick pinned layer, which enables good resistance control and large coercivity due to the effect of small film roughness. We also developed a new CoFeB-based free layer and writing scheme to control the stray field and spin-transfer torque. As a result, four stable and well-separated resistance states were obtained in resistance-voltage curves with a 65-nm top-pinned p-MTJ.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Highly manufacturable multi-level perpendicular MTJ with a single top-pinned layer and multiple barrier/free layers","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.2013.6724551","startPage":"3.3.1","endPage":"3.3.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.2013.6724551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724533","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/6709840/6724533/06724551.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724551","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724551/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Highly manufacturable multi-level perpendicular MTJ with a single top-pinned layer and multiple barrier/free layers","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6724551/","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14062139","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly manufacturable multi-level perpendicular MTJ with a single top-pinned layer and multiple barrier/free layers","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"s03p03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048966S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6709840","isNumber":"6724533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6709840","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6724533","articleId":"6724551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6724552,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The NAND is junction-free without dopant inside the array. Unlike the conventional 3D NAND, the drain side near SSL is N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">+</sup>\n doped junction, while source side near GSL is P\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">+</sup>\n junction. A positive pass-gate read voltage (Vpass, r) induces n-type virtual source/drain for the center WL's, giving an n-channel behavior. On the other hand, a negative Vpass, r induces p-type virtual source/drain, giving the p-channel behavior. Both n- and p-channel reads produce excellent Id-Vg characteristics with very small leakage current. The advantage of this device is that the carrier source of both +FN programming and -FN erasing can be readily provided by either N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">+</sup>\n drain or P\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">+</sup>\n source, respectively, without waiting for the GIDL generated minority carrier for the floating-body 3D NAND. This gives a much faster +/- FN speed than conventional 3D NAND. Moreover, both +FN and -FN can find suitable inhibit method, enabling a novel bit-alterable Flash memory. We have successfully compared, for the first time, two sensing methods (n- and p-channel read) and identified the trapped charge in the space between WL's. This not only provides characterization of charge lateral profile but also a new opportunity to create another storage node (in WL space) inside the array.","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/6709840/6724533/06724555.pdf","startPage":"3.7.1","endPage":"3.7.4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel dual-channel 3D NAND flash featuring both N-channel and P-channel NAND characteristics for bit-alterable Flash memory and a new opportunity in sensing the stored charge in the WL space","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.2013.6724555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.2013.6724555","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724555","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724555/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A novel dual-channel 3D NAND flash featuring both N-channel and P-channel NAND characteristics for bit-alterable Flash memory and a new opportunity in sensing the stored charge in the WL space","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14062228","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6724555/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel dual-channel 3D NAND flash featuring both N-channel and P-channel NAND characteristics for bit-alterable Flash memory and a new opportunity in sensing the stored charge in the WL space","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"s03p07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04033S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6709840","isNumber":"6724533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6709840","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6724533","articleId":"6724555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6724556,"authors":[{"name":"Wandong Kim","affiliation":["Inter-university Semiconductor Research Center (ISRC), Seoul National University, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Wandong","lastName":"Kim","id":"37577360100"},{"name":"Joo Yun Seo","affiliation":["Inter-university Semiconductor Research Center (ISRC), Seoul National University, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Joo Yun","lastName":"Seo","id":"38239912600"},{"name":"Yoon Kim","affiliation":["Inter-university Semiconductor Research Center (ISRC), Seoul National University, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Yoon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37311190900"},{"name":"Se Hwan Park","affiliation":["Inter-university Semiconductor Research Center (ISRC), Seoul National University, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Se Hwan","lastName":"Park","id":"38184515200"},{"name":"Sang Ho Lee","affiliation":["Inter-university Semiconductor Research Center (ISRC), Seoul National University, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Sang Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"38552181600"},{"name":"Myung Hyun Baek","affiliation":["Inter-university Semiconductor Research Center (ISRC), Seoul National University, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Myung Hyun","lastName":"Baek","id":"37085696243"},{"name":"Jong-Ho Lee","affiliation":["Inter-university Semiconductor Research Center (ISRC), Seoul National University, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085367913"},{"name":"Byung-Gook Park","affiliation":["Inter-university Semiconductor Research Center (ISRC), Seoul National University, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Byung-Gook","lastName":"Park","id":"37278999100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2306-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-017X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0163-1918"}],"articleNumber":"6724556","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":549},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724556","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Flash memories","Arrays","Microprocessors","Logic gates","Threshold voltage","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories","NAND circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["layer selection","multilevel operation","LSM architecture","string select transistor","SST","CSTAR","string select line bias","island-type SSL","bit lines","word lines","planar structure","channel stacked NAND flash memory array"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the channel stacked array (CSTAR) NAND flash memory with layer selection by multi-level operation (LSM) of string select transistor (SST) is proposed and investigated to solve problems of conventional channel stacked array. In case of LSM architecture, the stacked layers can be distinguished by combinations of multi-level states of SST and string select line (SSL) bias. Due to the layer selection performed by the bias of SSL, the placement of bit lines and word lines is similar to the conventional planar structure, and proposed CSTAR with LSM has no island-type SSLs.

In addition to understanding TFET's prospects for future technology nodes [3], we also need to assess if it enables continued scaling required for increasing transistor density. GaSb/InAs heterojunction TFET (Het-j TFET) is one of the leading TFET options due to its high drive-current [4]. In this paper, double-gate (DG) and nanowire (NW) Het-j TFETs (Fig. 1) are atomisticly modeled and compared to a MOSFET down to Lg~9nm, i.e. ITRS 2022 node [5]. To achieve TFET characteristics superior to a MOSFET, its DG body has to be extremely thin, so a NW TFET is therefore preferred due to its more relaxed thickness and better transistor characteristics. A new device - the Resonant-TFET (R-TFET), is proposed, with SS~25mV/dec over ~3.5 decades of current, enabling the scaling of tunneling transistors to sub-9nm gate-lengths (Lg).","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.2013.6724559","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/6709840/6724533/06724559.pdf","startPage":"4.3.1","endPage":"4.3.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.2013.6724559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heterojunction TFET Scaling and resonant-TFET for steep subthreshold slope at sub-9nm gate-length","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724559","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724559/","displayDocTitle":"Heterojunction TFET Scaling and resonant-TFET for steep subthreshold slope at sub-9nm gate-length","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14126468","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6724559/","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heterojunction TFET Scaling and resonant-TFET for steep subthreshold slope at sub-9nm gate-length","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"s04p03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033773S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6709840","isNumber":"6724533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6709840","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6724533","articleId":"6724559","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6724561,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Most of the retention studies so far focused on high switching current range. In this work, we investigate the retention degradation mechanism at low programming current range (10-40\u03bcA) and identify the key parameters that control retention in oxygen vacancy filamentary switching HfO<;sub>2<;/sub>/Hf 1T1R RRAM cells. Based on this understanding we demonstrated significant improvement in retention by adding an additional thermal budget into our process flow. The impact of the Forming process on retention property was also investigated and Forming/SET conditions were optimized to improve the retention without increasing the operation current.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.2013.6724598","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.2013.6724598","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/6709840/6724533/06724598.pdf","startPage":"10.1.1","endPage":"10.1.4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvement of data retention in HfO<inf>2</inf>/Hf 1T1R RRAM cell under low operating current","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724598/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improvement of data retention in HfO<inf>2</inf>/Hf 1T1R RRAM cell under low operating current","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14062135","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6724598/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvement of data retention in HfO<inf>2</inf>/Hf 1T1R RRAM cell under low operating current","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"s10p01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050951S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6709840","isNumber":"6724533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6709840","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6724533","articleId":"6724598","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6724599,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The 3D Via RRAM cell consists of a TaON-based resistive film, Cu Via as top electrode, and Cu metal as bottom electrode. The TaON-based RRAM film is a composite layer of backend metal glue layer of Ta and TaN in 28nm Cu damascene process. Moreover, in the compact 3D Via RRAM structure, the unit area of a single stacked cell-string is reduced to only 4 times of Via size by 28nm CMOS design rules. Since the cross-point 3D Via RRAM is fabricated without extra TMO film or process step, this excellent cell scalability and compatibility can provide a competitive low cost and high density embedded NVM solution in advanced CMOS logic nodes.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.2013.6724600","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/6709840/6724533/06724600.pdf","startPage":"10.3.1","endPage":"10.3.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.2013.6724600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra high density 3D via RRAM in pure 28nm CMOS process","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ultra high density 3D via RRAM in pure 28nm CMOS process","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14126483","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6724600/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724600/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra high density 3D via RRAM in pure 28nm CMOS process","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"s10p03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093288S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6709840","isNumber":"6724533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6709840","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6724533","articleId":"6724600","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6724601,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Wei Hsu","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, TW"],"firstName":"Chung-Wei","lastName":"Hsu"},{"name":"Chia-Chen Wan","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, TW"],"firstName":"Chia-Chen","lastName":"Wan"},{"name":"I-Ting Wang","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, TW"],"firstName":"I-Ting","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Mei-Chin Chen","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, TW"],"firstName":"Mei-Chin","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Chun-Li Lo","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, TW"],"firstName":"Chun-Li","lastName":"Lo"},{"name":"Yao-Jen Lee","affiliation":["National Applied Research Laboratories National Nano Device Laboratories, Hsinchu, TW"],"firstName":"Yao-Jen","lastName":"Lee"},{"name":"Wen-Yueh Jang","affiliation":["Winbond Electronics Corporation, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Yueh","lastName":"Jang"},{"name":"Chen-Hsi Lin","affiliation":["Winbond Electronics Corporation, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chen-Hsi","lastName":"Lin"},{"name":"Tuo-Hung Hou","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, TW"],"firstName":"Tuo-Hung","lastName":"Hou"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2306-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-017X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0163-1918"}],"articleNumber":"6724601","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1188},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724601","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Three-dimensional displays","Resistance","Switches","Very large scale integration","Electrodes","Transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random-access storage","rectifying circuits","tantalum","tantalum compounds","titanium","titanium compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D double-layer vertical RRAM","ultralow sub-\u03bcA operating current","high self-rectifying ratio","interfacial switching device","data storage","Ta-TaOx-TiO2-Ti"]}],"abstract":"The 3D double-layer vertical RRAM with ultralow sub-\u03bcA operating current and high self-rectifying ratio over 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n has been demonstrated for the first time.

Lowly-doped bulk-FF have worse electrostatics than SOI- and GeOI-FF. However, by introducing a 200 meV band offset/quantum barrier (QB) under the channel or a > 1e18 doped ground-plane (GP), the electrostatics of bulk-FF match those of SOI-and GeOI-FF for the 7 nm-node. For sufficient substrate isolation, the band offset must be positioned within 5 nm of the STI edge. The QB layer that provides the offset can be thinned down to 10 nm. A GP is more robust to variations in position, but thinning this layer requires doping levels that are undesired especially for Ge.

The final configuration of the filament in the OFF-state is bimodal with a finite non-zero probability of being in the QPC mode or entering the tunnel barrier (TUN) mode.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.2013.6724674","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/6709840/6724533/06724674.pdf","startPage":"21.1.1","endPage":"21.1.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.2013.6724674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic variability of vacancy filament configuration in ultra-thin dielectric RRAM and its impact on OFF-state reliability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724674/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic variability of vacancy filament configuration in ultra-thin dielectric RRAM and its impact on OFF-state reliability","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6724674/","accessionNumber":"14062184","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic variability of vacancy filament configuration in ultra-thin dielectric RRAM and its impact on OFF-state reliability","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"s21p01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094148S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6709840","isNumber":"6724533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6709840","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6724533","articleId":"6724674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6724675,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This architecture, however, faces critical reliability issues related to the highly defective channel (4-5). For instance, we recently showed that discrete current drops and fluctuations (RTN) are clearly observed in the transfer characteristics (I\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">D</sub>\n vs. V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">G</sub>\n) of these nanoscale vertical nFETs (Fig. 1). These instabilities were linked to single electron trapping/detrapping processes (6-7), which potentially may cause read errors during operation (4-5). The present paper therefore aims at characterizing these adverse switching traps to gain insight into their physical properties. A statistical comparison among different polysilicon channels is presented and benchmarked against monocrystalline planar nFETs. We reveal that a significant part of the switching traps reside in the poly-Si channel.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.2013.6724676","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.2013.6724676","startPage":"21.3.1","endPage":"21.3.4","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/6709840/6724533/06724676.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical spectroscopy of switching traps in deeply scaled vertical poly-Si channel for 3D memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724676/","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Statistical spectroscopy of switching traps in deeply scaled vertical poly-Si channel for 3D memories","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14062102","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6724676/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical spectroscopy of switching traps in deeply scaled vertical poly-Si channel for 3D memories","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"s21p03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.187119S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6709840","isNumber":"6724533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6709840","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6724533","articleId":"6724676","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6724678,"authors":[{"name":"G.

These innovative materials have been integrated in state-of-the-art memory cell prototypes. For the first time, a focus on the trade-off between SET stability (which is affected by resistance drift) and RESET HTDR is proposed. This aspect has been extensively characterized. Through physico-chemical analysis and electrical characterization we demonstrate the need for a specific \"programming-current-vs-time-profile\" to finally achieve an LRS stable at high-working temperature with programming times compatible with industrial applications. Finally, the reliability of the HRS and the LRS obtained with our optimized programming procedure has been demonstrated through Reflow Soldering Temperature Profile (RSTP) tests. The last result fully enables PCM for embedded applications, in which data integrity after the peak temperature of reflow soldering must be ensured.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.2013.6724678","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/6709840/6724533/06724678.pdf","startPage":"21.5.1","endPage":"21.5.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.2013.6724678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trade-off between SET and data retention performance thanks to innovative materials for phase-change memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724678/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Trade-off between SET and data retention performance thanks to innovative materials for phase-change memory","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14062236","htmlLink":"/document/6724678/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trade-off between SET and data retention performance thanks to innovative materials for phase-change memory","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"s21p05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064437S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6709840","isNumber":"6724533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6709840","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6724533","articleId":"6724678","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6724679,"authors":[{"name":"U.

To better assess the potential scaling and application as embedded memory [2], data retention and its statistics must be carefully understood and optimized. This work studies crystallization statistics in 1 Gb arrays of PCM devices. We evidence (i) retention stabilization by tuning of the programming conditions, and (ii) erratic retention due to crystallization variability. A new retention model is developed, which is capable of predicting cell-to-cell and cycle-to-cycle variability as a function of programming conditions.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.2013.6724680","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/6709840/6724533/06724680.pdf","startPage":"21.7.1","endPage":"21.7.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.2013.6724680","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intrinsic retention statistics in phase change memory (PCM) arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Intrinsic retention statistics in phase change memory (PCM) arrays","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14126478","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6724680/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intrinsic retention statistics in phase change memory (PCM) arrays","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"s21p07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099397S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6709840","isNumber":"6724533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6709840","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6724533","articleId":"6724680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6724681,"authors":[{"name":"N.

In addition to the driving force for atom diffusion coming from concentration gradient and electric field, the model also accounts for the effect of temperature gradient and phase segregation. This new diffusion model is coupled with a calibrated electro-thermal-phase change model, thus providing a unified framework for the self-consistent simulation of both the electro-thermal and the phase/material change problems.

The transport of charge and electron energy is self-consistently coupled to the Poisson and the Fourier heat equations, so that crystallization sites are found at the nanoscale. Results show how Ovonic switching and crystallization are both correlated to the formation of hot-carrier conduction paths, and the conditions for the occurrence of these phenomena are investigated. The model is then validated against data from ultra-scaled carbon-nanotube-contacted devices. Device-to-device variability of macroscopically identical devices is also analyzed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/6709840/6724533/06724686.pdf","startPage":"22.6.1","endPage":"22.6.4","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.2013.6724686","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.2013.6724686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724533","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724686","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel 3D random-network model for threshold switching of phase-change memories","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Crystallization","Switches","Scattering","Mathematical model","Phase change memory","Heating","Electric fields"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amorphous semiconductors","carbon nanotube field effect transistors","crystallisation","phase change memories","Poisson equation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D random network model","threshold switching","phase change memory devices","amorphous sample","charge transport","electron energy","Poisson equation","Fourier heat equations","crystallization sites","Ovonic switching","hot carrier conduction paths","ultrascaled carbon nanotube contacted devices","device to device variability","macroscopically identical devices"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724686/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Novel 3D random-network model for threshold switching of phase-change memories","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6724686/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14062247","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel 3D random-network model for threshold switching of phase-change memories","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"s22p06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071233S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6709840","isNumber":"6724533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6709840","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6724533","articleId":"6724686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6724690,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroki Noguchi","affiliation":["Corporate R&D Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroki","lastName":"Noguchi","id":"38569261900"},{"name":"Susumu Takeda","affiliation":["Corporate R&D Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Susumu","lastName":"Takeda","id":"37085369685"},{"name":"Kumiko Nomura","affiliation":["Corporate R&D Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Kumiko","lastName":"Nomura","id":"37299266100"},{"name":"Keiko Abe","affiliation":["Corporate R&D Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Keiko","lastName":"Abe","id":"37290923400"},{"name":"Kazutaka Ikegami","affiliation":["Corporate R&D Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazutaka","lastName":"Ikegami","id":"38018245600"},{"name":"Eiji Kitagawa","affiliation":["Corporate R&D Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Eiji","lastName":"Kitagawa","id":"37319741300"},{"name":"Naoharu Shimomura","affiliation":["Corporate R&D Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoharu","lastName":"Shimomura","id":"37412154000"},{"name":"Junichi Ito","affiliation":["Corporate R&D Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Junichi","lastName":"Ito","id":"38577800200"},{"name":"Shinobu Fujita","affiliation":["Corporate R&D Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinobu","lastName":"Fujita","id":"37275893200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2306-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-017X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0163-1918"}],"articleNumber":"6724690","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":461},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Nonvolatile memory","Registers","Arrays","Decoding","Magnetic tunneling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic storage","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonvolatile memory arrays","adaptive computing systems","magnetic RAM","memory capacity","variable circuit","1T-1MTJ","perpendicular STT-MRAM memory arrays","memory hierarchy","computing units","quadruple cell mode","circuit resources"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724690","abstract":"Magnetic RAM (MRAM) has a unique potential to change its memory capacity from small to large capacity.

In this work, we focus on hardware implementation of brain-like learning in a brain-inspired architecture.

Device and array-level studies using an experimental 10\u00d710 array of phase change synaptic devices have shown that pattern recognition is robust against synaptic resistance variations and large variations can be tolerated by increasing the number of training iterations.

The memory cell performance for a horizontal cross-point is shown experimentally to be essentially comparable to vertical pillar-around geometry. Array performances (read/write, energy, and speed) of different 3D architectures are investigated by SPICE simulation, showing horizontal stacked RRAM is superior but suffers from higher bit cost. Adopting a bi-layer pillar electrode structure is demonstrated to enlarge the array size in 3D vertical RRAM. Design guidelines are proposed for the 3D VRRAM: it shows that increasing the number of stacks of VRRAM while keeping the total bits the same, as well as scaling of feature size (F), are critical for

The dependency of the DC and AC performances of Si NW MOSFETs on NW diameter (D\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">NW</sub>\n) and gate oxide thickness has been investigated. A Si NW device with the scaled D\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">NW</sub>\n of 9 nm and thin equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) of 0.9 nm improved both on-current and electrostatic characteristics. Finally, a Nanowire-On-Insulator (NOI) structure has been proposed to enhance the AC performance of a multiple-stacked NWs structure, which improves DC performance but has the issue of high parasitic capacitance. As a result, the simulated AC performance of a triple-NOI structure was improved by around 20% compared to conventional triple NW structure.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724698/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14126469","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6724698/","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A practical Si nanowire technology with nanowire-on-insulator structure for beyond 10nm logic technologies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A practical Si nanowire technology with nanowire-on-insulator structure for beyond 10nm logic technologies","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"s26p05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090324S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6709840","isNumber":"6724533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6709840","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6724533","articleId":"6724698","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6724704,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In a PCM array, thermal crosstalk is referred to as a potential concern due to a temperature raise driven by the programming operation in a cell and its impact on data retention in the neighbor ones. In fact a programming operation in PCM induces a temperature raise in the cell surrounding environment [1]. Such issue has been already addressed in 54nm PCM [5] through an accurate tuning of the programming algorithm. Although effective, such an approach implies several constraints for further optimization of the PCM array performances. In this work we empirically investigate the thermal crosstalk in 45nm PCM arrays, clearly highlighting the key role of the interface thermal resistances engineering. PCM cell design rules for thermal crosstalk immune operation are discussed and implemented on silicon, leading to a fully disturb-immune qualified process.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.2013.6724724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.2013.6724724","endPage":"30.4.4","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/6709840/6724533/06724724.pdf","startPage":"30.4.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interface engineering for thermal disturb immune phase change memory technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724724/","displayDocTitle":"Interface engineering for thermal disturb immune phase change memory technology","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14126482","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6724724/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interface engineering for thermal disturb immune phase change memory technology","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"s30p04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073147S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6709840","isNumber":"6724533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6709840","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6724533","articleId":"6724724","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6724726,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This is because although GST-225 is a fast switching material it suffers large volume change when melting thus limited cycling endurance. Attempts to improve the endurance so far must sacrifice switching speed. This work explores new phase change material by atomic-level engineering the doping to GST. The resulting new phase-change material has demonstrated fast switching speed of 20 ns, long endurance of 1G cycles and low reset current of 150 \u03bcA in a 128 Mb test chip.

In non-critical consumer applications (cell phone, printer, gaming), a relatively high soft error rate (SER) is often tolerable. In contrast, a similar failure rate would be deemed unacceptably high in an arena where system reliability, accessibility, and serviceability are of paramount importance (networking, server, avionic, space), particularly where human life or safety is at risk (medical, automotive, transportation). Increasing number of industry segments are impacted due to growing amount of memory and logic components per circuit. Concurrently, sub-45nm downscaling has a profound impact on SER of bulk CMOS technologies. The enhanced resilience of latest SOI technologies helps to leverage existing robust design solutions.

The resolution of the ultrasound imaging systems is related with the sensitivity of the transducers so the high voltage output signals of the power amplifiers are required to be used to drive the transducers. Therefore, a linear power amplifier is more attractive choice because of its higher dynamic range of the output signals. The novel pre-distortion circuit using the passive resistor, capacitor and inductor components with a power MOSFET device was designed to enhance the dynamic range of the power amplifiers. The dynamic range of the power amplifiers is defined as the characteristic to amplify an input signal with less distortion.

The preferred frequency estimator is the Welch method, which is robust and fast, but requires at least 64-128 samples, gathered one per pulse repetition interval (PRIs), to guarantee adequate spectral resolution. The Blood Amplitude and Phase EStimator (BAPES) is an alternative technique that was recently proven suitable for producing good spectrograms using down to 16 PRIs per frame. This achievement allows a better time resolution and/or higher B-mode frame rates when working in Duplex mode, but unfortunately BAPES requires much more calculations than Welch, making its real-time employment quite challenging. In this work we present a BAPES implementation on a state-of-the-art fixed point DSP. This implementation, exploiting the Newton method for inverse matrix approximation, produces a 128 frequency-point frame in less than 5 ms. The error measured in a test on the common carotid artery of a volunteer was lower than 0.2% with respect to a floating-point reference implementation.","pdfPath":"/iel7/6708499/6724747/06724772.pdf","startPage":"899","endPage":"902","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0231","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0231","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724772","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital signal processing","Vectors","Doppler effect","Frequency estimation","Approximation methods","Covariance matrices","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","blood","blood flow measurement","blood vessels","cellular transport","digital signal processing chips","Doppler measurement","floating point arithmetic","inverse problems","medical signal processing","Newton method","real-time systems","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time BAPES implementation","fast spectral Doppler estimation","backscattered echoes","blood red cells","blood vessel","spectral analysis","sonogram","frequency estimator","Welch method","pulse repetition interval","PRI","spectral resolution","Blood Amplitude and Phase EStimator","spectrogram","time resolution","B-mode frame rates","Duplex mode","fixed point DSP","Newton method","inverse matrix approximation","frequency-point frame","common carotid artery","floating-point reference implementation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BAPES","Adaptive Spectral Analysis","Spectral Doppler"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724772/","displayDocTitle":"Real-time BAPES implementation for fast spectral Doppler estimation","accessionNumber":"14061747","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","publicationDate":"July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6724772/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2013","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time BAPES implementation for fast spectral Doppler estimation","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"UFFC2013000124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062342S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6708499","isNumber":"6724747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6708499","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6724747","articleId":"6724772","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6724779,"authors":[{"name":"Mun-Bo Shim","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Samsung Electronics, Co.

In case of multiple focusing, the shape and scan time of the single block which is a fundamental factor for planning the positions of the blocks depends on the sequence plan. In the previous study, new HIFU transducer architecture with sparse array (some of total elements), which can generate multiple-focus patterns simultaneously was designed and evaluated. Planning the sequence of multiple-focus scan for the block is a time consuming and monotonous task, but requires at the same time expertise and precision. Furthermore, due to the complex characteristics of HIFU treatment, it is difficult to optimize manually. Besides, the objectives of uniform high dose to the block and fast ablation are invariably in conflict, often requiring compromises to be made between them when selecting the best sequence plan for a particular condition. The multiobjective optimization problem used as the objectives of uniform high dose to the block and fast ablation was formulated in term of the scanning sequence of multiple-focus patterns. Pareto-based continuous evolutionary algorithms for multiobjective optimization (MOPCEAs) developed by the author was used to solve the sequence planning. In multiobjective sequence planning, we produced diverse Pareto-optimal solutions, and the treatment planner could navigate through them intuitively.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0237","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6708499/6724747/06724779.pdf","startPage":"922","endPage":"925","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724747","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective optimization technique for treatment planning in HIFU","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724779","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724779/","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective optimization technique for treatment planning in HIFU","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14061941","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6724779/","conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective optimization technique for treatment planning in HIFU","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"UFFC2013000139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050178S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6708499","isNumber":"6724747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6708499","xplore-issue":"6724747","articleId":"6724779","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6724782,"authors":[{"name":"Nobuo Goto","affiliation":["Dept.of Optical Science and Technology, The University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Nobuo","lastName":"Goto","id":"37301124500"},{"name":"Yasumitsu Miyazaki","affiliation":["Dept. of Media Informatics, Aichi University of Technology, Gamagori, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasumitsu","lastName":"Miyazaki","id":"37288598000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5686-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5684-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-0117"}],"articleNumber":"6724782","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":33},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical switches","Surface acoustic waves","Optical waveguides","Optical pulse shaping","Optical distortion","Adaptive optics","Optical filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acousto-optical devices","Butterworth filters","directional couplers","optical switches","quadrature phase shift keying","surface acoustic wave waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelength-selective switching","optical DQPSK pulse train","collinear acoustooptic devices","optical switching","sidelobe-suppressed device","surface-acoustic-wave waveguide","SAW","Butterworth-type filter device","directional coupler","quadrature phase-shift-keying"]}],"abstract":"Optical switching of high-bit-rate QPSK pulse trains using collinear acoustooptic (AO) devices is theoretically discussed.

Given an excitation in time and space, multiple eigen-modes derived from solving the PDE may propagate each with different dispersion characteristics and weight. Considering a broad-band pulse exciting from one side of a hollow cylindrical waveguide, the received signal at the other side consists of all propagating eigen-modes that can be considered approximately as the narrow band signals. The synchrosqueezed wavelet transform (SWT) is employed to sharpen the time-frequency representation (TFR) of the received waveguide signal. Using a ridge detection algorithm, we successively separate the synchrosqueezed TFR into several narrow band TFRs which can be identified as oscillatory components with time-varying frequency. Then those separated TFRs are reconstructed as narrow band signals using the inverse SWT. Based on an analytical model of the waveguide, we observe that the decomposed signals are similar to those dominant eigen-modes simulated above. Moreover, also the group delay and, therefore, the group velocity of each decomposed signal can be estimated well. This is of high interest when analyzing the characteristic of a given waveguide, such as acoustical property measurements or non-destructive testing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrasonic waveguide signal decomposition using the synchrosqueezed wavelet transform for modal group delay computation","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0173","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6708499/6724747/06724816.pdf","startPage":"671","endPage":"674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724747","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724816","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Ultrasonic waveguide signal decomposition using the synchrosqueezed wavelet transform for modal group delay computation","conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6724816/","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14061821","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrasonic waveguide signal decomposition using the synchrosqueezed wavelet transform for modal group delay computation","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"UFFC2013000321.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08691S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6708499","isNumber":"6724747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6708499","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6724747","articleId":"6724816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6724827,"authors":[{"name":"Ling Tong","affiliation":["Lab on Cardiovascular Imaging & Dynamics, Catholic University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Tong","id":"37071662500"},{"name":"Alejandra Ortega","affiliation":["Lab on Cardiovascular Imaging & Dynamics, Catholic University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Alejandra","lastName":"Ortega","id":"37085491247"},{"name":"Hang Gao","affiliation":["Lab on Cardiovascular Imaging & Dynamics, Catholic University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Gao","id":"37403295400"},{"name":"Jan D'hooge","affiliation":["Lab on Cardiovascular Imaging & Dynamics, Catholic University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"D'hooge","id":"37277201000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5686-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5684-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-0117"}],"articleNumber":"6724827","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":231},"abstract":"Current volumetric cardiac ultrasound systems suffer from relatively low spatiotemporal resolution limiting their applicability in clinical practice. We have previously demonstrated in 2D that a proper implementation of a 4 multi-line transmit (4MLT, i.e., 4 simultaneous transmits) system can increase frame rate without compromising spatial resolution or signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) significantly. The aim of the current study was to verify whether our 2D findings could be extrapolated to 3D in order to set up a system that would allow for fast volumetric imaging based on MLT beam forming. In this study, a 64\u00d748-element 2D phased array (2.5 MHz; 50% bandwidth) transmitting 16MLT beams was simulated using a GPU-based implementation of the impulse response method. Based on this transducer, the C-plane two-way beam profiles of a 16MLT system with different MLT transmit patterns were simulated and qualitatively compared to investigate their cross-talk level. In addition, based on our 2D findings, the effect of a (2D) Tukey (\u03b1=0.5) apodization was tested on transmit and receive to suppress the cross-talk. The results showed that properly aligning the 16MLT beams along directions close to the diagonal of the 2D transducer aperture resulted in a reduction of cross-talk under about - 50dB level. Similar to our findings in 2D, additional Tukey (\u03b1=0.5) apodization could also suppress cross-talk down to - 50dB. These findings show that the proposed 16MLT system may have the potential to generate good volumetric images at 16-fold volume rates without significantly compromising spatial resolution or SNR. In addition, given sufficient parallel beam forming capacity of the system, the proposed 16MLT could be combined with 4 parallel receive lines (4MLA) to increase frame rate by a factor of 64 allowing for dense high quality 90\u00d790 degree volumetric imaging at 30Hz.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium

Characters of CF and TAC for a point, homogeneous speckle, and a point and a cyst within homogeneous speckle environment under narrow and broad band were simulated.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724747","startPage":"809","endPage":"812","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6708499/6724747/06724828.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of signal coherence in ultrasound beamforming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724828/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6724828/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of signal coherence in ultrasound beamforming","conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14061930","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of signal coherence in ultrasound beamforming","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"UFFC2013000364.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086695S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6708499","isNumber":"6724747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6708499","xplore-issue":"6724747","articleId":"6724828","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6724847,"authors":[{"name":"Bakary Diarra","affiliation":["CREATIS, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon; CNRS UMR5220 INSERM U1044; Universit\u00e9 Lyon1; INSA-Lyon, Villeurbanne, France"],"firstName":"Bakary","lastName":"Diarra","id":"38469470900"},{"name":"Marc Robini","affiliation":["CREATIS, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon; CNRS UMR5220 INSERM U1044; Universit\u00e9 Lyon1; INSA-Lyon, Villeurbanne, France"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Robini","id":"37296511800"},{"name":"Herv\u00e9 Liebgott","affiliation":["CREATIS, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon; CNRS UMR5220 INSERM U1044; Universit\u00e9 Lyon1; INSA-Lyon, Villeurbanne, France"],"firstName":"Herv\u00e9","lastName":"Liebgott","id":"37298011200"},{"name":"Christian Cachard","affiliation":["CREATIS, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon; CNRS UMR5220 INSERM U1044; Universit\u00e9 Lyon1; INSA-Lyon, Villeurbanne, France"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Cachard","id":"37298009500"},{"name":"Piero Tortoli","affiliation":["Universita degli Studi di Firenze, Firenze, Toscana, IT"],"firstName":"Piero","lastName":"Tortoli","id":"37297991300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5686-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5684-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-0117"}],"articleNumber":"6724847","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":152},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724847","abstract":"The sparse array technique is an excellent approach to tackle the connection difficulties due to the huge number of elements of 2D matrix arrays. However, the reduction of the element number leads to significant performance reduction, especially in terms of energy loss. An efficient alternative to increase the array sensitivity is using elements wider than \u03bb/2 while non-grid positioning strategies are adopted. To further decrease the unwanted lobes of the array beam, the variable-size elements array is proposed. This new configuration, combining the randomness of elements position and of their size, leads to excellent beam patterns. In addition, the main lobe width can be controlled to change the array spatial resolution.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0132","startPage":"508","endPage":"511","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6708499/6724747/06724847.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724747","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable-size elements in 2D sparse arrays for 3D medical ultrasound","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic imaging","Standards","Finite element analysis","Acoustics","Imaging","Gratings","Simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","sensitivity","ultrasonic imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array spatial resolution","variable-size elements array","array beam lobes","nongrid positioning strategies","array sensitivity","energy loss","element number reduction","2D matrix arrays","sparse array technique","3D medical ultrasound","2D sparse arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ultrasound imaging","2D array","non-grid sparse array","simulated annealing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724847/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Variable-size elements in 2D sparse arrays for 3D medical ultrasound","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6724847/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2013","accessionNumber":"14068025","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable-size elements in 2D sparse arrays for 3D medical ultrasound","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"UFFC2013000410.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092251S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6708499","isNumber":"6724747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6708499","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6724747","articleId":"6724847","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6724855,"authors":[{"name":"Sevan Harput","affiliation":["Ultrasound Group, University of Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Sevan","lastName":"Harput","id":"37399486300"},{"name":"Muhammad Arif","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Mehran University of Engineering & Technology, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Arif","id":"38667063300"},{"name":"James McLaughlan","affiliation":["Ultrasound Group, University of Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"McLaughlan","id":"37294344200"},{"name":"Peter R.

In this study, the effectiveness of a combination of techniques: adaptive window selection, aberration correction, and Wiener post-filtering, was tested to enhance transcranial grayscale image quality in vivo.

In contrast to previous work, we propose a new approach based on the use of learned overcomplete dictionaries. Such dictionaries allow for much sparser representations of the signals since they are optimized for a particular class of images such as US images. In this study, the dictionary was learned using the K-SVD algorithm on patches extracted from the image to be reconstructed for an initial validation. Experiments were performed on experimental beamformed RF data acquired by imaging a general-purpose phantom. CS reconstruction was performed by removing 25% to 75% of the original samples according to a uniform law. Reconstructions using a K-SVD dictionary previously trained dictionary on experimental US images indicate minimal information loss, thus showing the potential of the overcomplete dictionaries.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0012","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6708499/6724747/06724903.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724747","startPage":"45","endPage":"48","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing ultrasound imaging using overcomplete dictionaries","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724903","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing ultrasound imaging using overcomplete dictionaries","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724903/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14061583","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6724903/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing ultrasound imaging using overcomplete dictionaries","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"UFFC2013000643.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058972S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6708499","isNumber":"6724747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6708499","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6724747","articleId":"6724903","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6724905,"authors":[{"name":"Martin F.

The imaging quality is compared to a conventionally fully addressed array using 1024 elements and 256 emissions. The main-lobe of the measured line spread function is almost identical, but the side-lobe levels are higher for the row-column addressed array. The cystic resolution sampled at a relative intensity difference of 20 dB shows a cyst size of 5.00mm for the row-column addressed array and 2.39mm for the fully sampled array. A simulation study is carried out which compares how the imaging quality of the two addressing methods scales with the number of beamforming channels used. It is shown that for any fixed number of active elements, a row-column addressed array achieves a better image quality than fully addressing the array.

Previous studies have shown DAX can improve contrast of images constructed using delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming, without worsening image resolution. However, artifactual black spots may arise in regions away from the transmit focus after DAX processing is performed. Beamforming by spatial matched filtering (SMF) is a novel method capable of focusing both transmit and receive beams throughout the field of view. In this method, instead DAS beamforming, echo signals from individual receive channels are passed through individual spatial matched filters built from the experimental impulse response of the imaging system. Then the filtered signals are summed up along the receive aperture. In this paper, we present our work on applying DAX to SMF beamforming to achieve enhanced image contrast at all imaging depths with minimum artifacts being introduced.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724747","startPage":"813","endPage":"816","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6708499/6724747/06724919.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image contrast enhancement using dual apodization with cross-correlation and beamforming by spatial matched filtering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724919/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6724919/","displayDocTitle":"Image contrast enhancement using dual apodization with cross-correlation and beamforming by spatial matched filtering","conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14061842","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image contrast enhancement using dual apodization with cross-correlation and beamforming by spatial matched filtering","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"UFFC2013000704.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059238S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6708499","isNumber":"6724747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6708499","xplore-issue":"6724747","articleId":"6724919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6724935,"authors":[{"name":"David M.

Using a phased array it is possible to ensure selectivity, both in terms of the mode and the direction of the wave.

The aim of this study is to improve the identification of cracks in thin plates and pipes. In this work, a novel adaptive beamforming technique for guided waves is developed. The method is based on a recursive feedback algorithm which optimizes the individual excitation waveforms to increase the total energy at a desired mode, and enhance a unidirectional propagation of the ultrasonic wave.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0043","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6708499/6724747/06724935.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0043","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","startPage":"166","endPage":"169","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Guided wave enhancement phased array beamforming scheme using recursive feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724935","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Guided wave enhancement phased array beamforming scheme using recursive feedback","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724935/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6724935/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14061724","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guided wave enhancement phased array beamforming scheme using recursive feedback","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"UFFC2013000782.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059738S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6708499","isNumber":"6724747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6708499","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6724747","articleId":"6724935","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6724957,"authors":[{"name":"Shigeaki Okumura","affiliation":["Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeaki","lastName":"Okumura","id":"37085589013"},{"name":"Hirofumi Taki","affiliation":["Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Hirofumi","lastName":"Taki","id":"37391025800"},{"name":"Toru Sato","affiliation":["Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Toru","lastName":"Sato","id":"37279017400"},{"name":"Aya Kita","affiliation":["Sakai Rumi Clinic, Hyogo, Japan"],"firstName":"Aya","lastName":"Kita","id":"37086797014"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5686-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5684-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-0117"}],"articleNumber":"6724957","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cranium","Blood flow","Interference","Estimation","Doppler effect","Ultrasonic imaging","Hemorrhaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","biomedical ultrasonics","blood flow measurement","cellular biophysics","covariance matrices","filtering theory","medical signal processing","velocity measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transcranial Doppler ultrasound","adaptive beamforming technique","high-intensity interferences","vasospasm","postoperative management","subarachnoid hemorrhage","diagnostic safety test","TCD","moving target indicator filter","suppress echoes","spatial domain interferometry","Capon method","MTI filtering","red blood cells","blood flow velocity estimation","signal intensity","cranium interference intensity","covariance matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Transcranial Doppler ultrasound","blood flow velocity estimation","spatial domain interferometry","adaptive beamforming","Capon method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724957","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0375","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","abstract":"The control of vasospasm is important in postoperative management after the occurrence of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) is a diagnostic safety test that measures the blood flow in the cranium; however, TCD has low reliability because of the high-intensity interference returned from the cranium. In this study, we employed two techniques to suppress interferences. First, we used a moving target indicator (MTI) filter that suppresses echoes from undesired stationary targets. Second, we applied spatial domain interferometry with the Capon method to the signal after MTI filtering. The desired signal from red blood cells is supposed to have a low correlation with the interferences from undesired stationary targets. We thus averaged the covariance matrix to range direction without averaging sub-matrices in the diagonal direction. In a simulation study, we succeeded in estimating blood flow velocity with an average estimation velocity error of 0.2 m/s, where the desired signal intensity from red blood cells is 60 dB lower than the cranium interference intensity. The center frequency of the pulse is 2.0 MHz and the pulse length is 5 \u03bcs. These results indicate the high potential of the proposed method for improving the estimation accuracy of blood flow velocity in the cranium.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724747","startPage":"1480","endPage":"1483","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6708499/6724747/06724957.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transcranial Doppler ultrasound using adaptive beamforming technique for the suppression of high-intensity interferences","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724957/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6724957/","displayDocTitle":"Transcranial Doppler ultrasound using adaptive beamforming technique for the suppression of high-intensity interferences","conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14062018","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transcranial Doppler ultrasound using adaptive beamforming technique for the suppression of high-intensity interferences","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"UFFC2013000869.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051788S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6708499","isNumber":"6724747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6708499","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6724747","articleId":"6724957","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6724960,"authors":[{"name":"Brett Byram","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina"],"firstName":"Brett","lastName":"Byram","id":"37396852900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5686-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5684-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-0117"}],"articleNumber":"6724960","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scattering","Clutter","Chirp","Transducers","Signal to noise ratio","Speckle","In vivo"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","biomedical ultrasonics","clutter","image enhancement","medical image processing","reverberation","ultrasonic scattering","ultrasonic transducer arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model based beamformer","spatial chirps","off-axis clutter suppression","near-field clutter suppression","in vivo ultrasonic imaging","transducer arrays","visualization degradation","fundamental beamforming limitations","media dependent limitations","sound speed variation effect","off-axis scattering effect","reverberation effect","degradation source suppression","radio frequency signal preservation","image contrast improvement","contrast to noise ratio"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724960","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0330","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","abstract":"In vivo ultrasonic imaging with transducer arrays suffers from degraded visualization caused by a number of sources including fundamental beamforming limitations and media dependent limitations such as sound speed variation, off-axis scattering and reverberation.

However, ultrasound simulation presents a computationally difficult problem, as simulation domains are very large compared with the acoustic wavelengths of interest. This becomes a greater problem when simulating high intensity focussed ultrasound since nonlinear effects increase the required resolution of computational grids. Two common methods for dealing with this difficulty include using spectral methods for solving the acoustic model equations and using an axisymmetric assumption for the system. In this paper, a full-wave nonlinear model similar to the Westervelt equation is solved using pseudospectral methods based on the discrete sine and cosine transforms. These methods can be used to apply homogeneous Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions (both of which are present in axisymmetric systems) while retaining the many established benefits of the Fourier spectral method. The accuracy of the model is established through comparison with analytical solutions to several nonlinear wave equations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full-wave nonlinear ultrasound simulation in an axisymmetric coordinate system using the discrete sine and cosine transforms","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0349","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6708499/6724747/06724970.pdf","startPage":"1374","endPage":"1377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724747","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724970","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724970/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Full-wave nonlinear ultrasound simulation in an axisymmetric coordinate system using the discrete sine and cosine transforms","conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6724970/","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14062004","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-wave nonlinear ultrasound simulation in an axisymmetric coordinate system using the discrete sine and cosine transforms","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"UFFC2013000920.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067293S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6708499","isNumber":"6724747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6708499","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6724747","articleId":"6724970","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6724975,"authors":[{"name":"He Yin","affiliation":["Dept.

On the contrary, parallel transmit beam forming can be more easily applied to harmonic imaging, as focusing may be utilized to increase the amplitude of the pressure wave fields. However, interbeam interference represents an issue. To overcome these shortcomings and exploit the benefit of combining harmonic imaging and a high data acquisition rate, a new approach has been recently presented which relies on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to perform parallel beamforming in transmission. Here, this technique is implemented for the first time on an advanced open platform for ultrasound research (ULA-OP) and the achievable resolution and interbeam interference have been investigated.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6708499/6724747/06724982.pdf","startPage":"1468","endPage":"1471","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0372","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724747","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel transmit beamforming by means of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing: Implementation on an open research platform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Imaging","Harmonic analysis","Interference","Array signal processing","Power harmonic filters","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","acoustic wave interference","array signal processing","OFDM modulation","ultrasonic imaging","ultrasonic transmission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interbeam interference","ultrasound research","OFDM","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","high data acquisition rate","pressure wave fields","focusing","parallel transmit beam forming","harmonic components","high-amplitude pressure wave fields","focused ultrasound beams","absolute pressure values","plane wave transmission","wide beam","harmonic imaging","parallel receive beam forming","open research platform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency multiplexing","Harmonic imaging","Parallel Beamforming","Parallel transmission","ULA-OP"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724982/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Parallel transmit beamforming by means of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing: Implementation on an open research platform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6724982/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14062080","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel transmit beamforming by means of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing: Implementation on an open research platform","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"UFFC2013000970.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050677S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6708499","isNumber":"6724747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6708499","xplore-issue":"6724747","articleId":"6724982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6724984,"authors":[{"name":"Hideyuki Hasegawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering;"],"firstName":"Hideyuki","lastName":"Hasegawa","id":"37274688100"},{"name":"Yuji Sato","affiliation":["School of Engineering Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuji","lastName":"Sato","id":"37086751997"},{"name":"Hiroshi Kanai","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering;"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Kanai","id":"37272134500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5686-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5684-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-0117"}],"articleNumber":"6724984","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":127},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724984","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Ultrasonic imaging","Acoustics","Radio frequency","Array signal processing","Echocardiography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blood","blood flow measurement","blood pressure measurement","echocardiography","image resolution","medical image processing","ultrasonic imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high frame rate ultrasonic imaging","heart","virtual point sources","front-of-array","high frame rate echocardiography","transmit beam","diverging beam","plane wave","sound pressure","conventional focused beam","synthetic aperture imaging","blood flow imaging","dynamic focusing","spherical focusing","multiple receiving beams","overlapping receiving beams","ultrasound imaging phantom","spatial resolutions","width-at-half maximum","parallel beamforming","B-mode images","distance 100 mm","distance 20 mm"]}],"abstract":"We previously developed a method for high frame rate echocardiography [frame rate (FR) > 300 Hz] using a transmit beam, which was spherically diverging from a virtual point source behind the array. Although such diverging beam illuminates a wider area compared with a focused beam or plane wave, sound pressure starts to decrease just after emission. Another type of a diverging beam, which is diverging from a focal point of a conventional focused beam, has already been proposed for synthetic aperture imaging. This type of beam can increase sound pressure around the focal point, and it would be useful for applications which require higher sound pressure, such as blood flow imaging. In the present study, the feasibility of high frame rate echocardiography using diverging beams from conventional focused beams was examined. In the present study, multiple focused receiving beams were created using diverging beams in front of focal points of conventional focused transmit beams. Smaller focal distance achieves a wider diverging angle and the number of transmissions can be reduced. In the proposed method, wave fronts were assumed to be spherical, and dynamic focusing was used in receive. Since multiple receiving beams were created for each transmission, overlapping receiving beams were averaged after beamforming. The proposed method was evaluated using an ultrasound imaging phantom. Spatial resolutions (width at half maximum) of parallel beamforming with plane wave and diverging beams from virtual point sources at distances of 100 mm behind array and 20 mm in front of array were 1.17, 1.04, and 1.08 mm (at 44 mm depth), respectively. B-mode images could be obtained with good spatial resolutions using transmit beams diverging in front of focal points.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0150","startPage":"581","endPage":"584","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6708499/6724747/06724984.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724747","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High frame rate ultrasonic imaging of the heart by placing virtual point sources in front of array","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724984/","conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"High frame rate ultrasonic imaging of the heart by placing virtual point sources in front of array","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14061982","publicationDate":"July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6724984/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High frame rate ultrasonic imaging of the heart by placing virtual point sources in front of array","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"UFFC2013000977.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080131S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6708499","isNumber":"6724747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6708499","xplore-issue":"6724747","articleId":"6724984","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6724991,"authors":[{"name":"Parag V.

A 532-nm laser beam was coaxially delivered through an 800-\u03bcm hole in the central element of the array. The assembly was raster-scanned to acquire co-registered, 3D HFU and PA image data. Two synthetic-focusing schemes were compared: delay-and-sum (DAS) and DAS-weighted with an inter-channel coherence factor (DAS+CF). Bench-top experiments that employed an 80-\u03bcm hair and a tissue-mimicking phantom embedded with 530-\u03bcm anechoic spheres were performed to compare the two schemes applied to PA and HFU data, respectively. The DAS+CF scheme increased the SNR by approximately 10 dB for both modalities. The dimension of the hair in DAS-only PA image with a 20-dB dynamic range was approximately twice that in the corresponding DAS+CF image. The DAS-only HFU image of the anechoic phantoms exhibited a depth-dependent contrast ratio (CR) of less than 0.7 beyond the depth of 14 mm (CR = 1 represents a perfect contrast), whereas the CR remained greater than 0.7 in the DAS+CF image. DAS+CF approach also improved visualization of brain ventricles and vasculature in a 12-day old mouse embryo.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0305","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6708499/6724747/06724991.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0305","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","startPage":"1193","endPage":"1196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coherence-weighted beamforming and automated vessel segmentation for improving photoacoustic imaging of embryonic vasculature using annular arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6724991","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Coherence-weighted beamforming and automated vessel segmentation for improving photoacoustic imaging of embryonic vasculature using annular arrays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6724991/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6724991/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14061846","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherence-weighted beamforming and automated vessel segmentation for improving photoacoustic imaging of embryonic vasculature using annular arrays","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"UFFC2013001011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082022S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6708499","isNumber":"6724747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6708499","xplore-issue":"6724747","articleId":"6724991","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6724994,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Piezoelectric substrates introduced over the past two decades, such as the langasite (LGS) family of crystals, gallium orthophosphate, and aluminum nitride have enabled the exploration of microwave acoustics sensing at temperatures above 500\u00b0C. However the ability of the substrate to withstand high temperatures is only one of the requirements for sensor operation in harsh environments. Other prerequisites are: the development of stable high-temperature device electrodes; appropriate packaging; and resilience of the entire system to thermal shock and thermal cycling. In this paper, the wireless operation of microwave acoustic wave sensors in harsh environments is reviewed, and recent achievements are highlighted. Particular focus is given to surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor technology because it has the advantage of being wireless, battery-free, and allows interrogation of arrays of multiple devices. During the last decade, wireless hostile environment microwave acoustic sensors that can detect gases and monitor temperature and pressure have transitioned from laboratory proof-of-concept to commercial devices and systems. Recent accomplishments in thin film technology and packaging are extending the technology to even higher temperatures, beyond 1000\u00b0C. These technological advances are enabling wireless microwave acoustic sensor applications in hostile environments including power plants, turbine engines, oil/gas refineries, and high temperature industrial processing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725012/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2013","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14061834","publicationDate":"July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6725012/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Wireless sensing in hostile environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless sensing in hostile environments","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"UFFC2013001102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092657S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6708499","isNumber":"6724747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6708499","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6724747","articleId":"6725012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":6725021,"authors":[{"name":"Spenser Gilliland","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Spenser","lastName":"Gilliland","id":"38469760600"},{"name":"Pramod Govindan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Pramod","lastName":"Govindan","id":"37071710500"},{"name":"Thomas Gonnot","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Gonnot","id":"37071370700"},{"name":"Jafar Saniie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Jafar","lastName":"Saniie","id":"37300151000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5686-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5684-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-0117"}],"articleNumber":"6725021","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":629},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustics","Field programmable gate arrays","Signal processing algorithms","Chirp","System-on-chip","Time-frequency analysis","Signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive moving average processes","field programmable gate arrays","Fourier transforms","hardware-software codesign","nondestructive testing","signal processing","ultrasonic imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded ARM processor","ultrasonic imaging","signal processing","nondestructive testing","hardware-software co-design","HW-SW co-design","split spectrum processing","chirplet signal decomposition","Wigner-Ville distributions","short time Fourier transform","Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA","MicroBlaze processor","Xilinx Zynq FPGA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725021","abstract":"This study evaluates the performance of an FPGA based embedded ARM processor system to implement signal processing for ultrasonic imaging and nondestructive testing applications.

Overall, the Xilinx Zynq FPGA significantly outperforms the Virtex-5 based system in software applications.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0135","startPage":"519","endPage":"522","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724747","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6708499/6724747/06725021.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of FPGA based embedded ARM processor for ultrasonic imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725021/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of FPGA based embedded ARM processor for ultrasonic imaging","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6725021/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14061940","publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of FPGA based embedded ARM processor for ultrasonic imaging","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"UFFC2013001122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035567S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6708499","isNumber":"6724747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6708499","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6724747","articleId":"6725021","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6725032,"authors":[{"name":"Yen Chuo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yen Chuo","id":"37086752674"},{"name":"Tsung-Han Chan","affiliation":["Advanced Digital Sciences Center, Singapore"],"lastName":"Tsung-Han Chan","id":"37086754236"},{"name":"Meng-Lin Li","affiliation":["Institute of Photonics Technologies, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Meng-Lin Li","id":"37278837300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5686-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5684-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-0117"}],"articleNumber":"6725032","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":199},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Biomedical imaging","Ultrasonic variables measurement","Monitoring","Biomedical monitoring","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","cancer","compressed sensing","feature extraction","image restoration","image sampling","mean square error methods","medical image processing","optimisation","phantoms","tumours","ultrasonic imaging","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrasound compressed sensing","ultrasound imaging data reconstruction","ultrasound post-beamformed data reconstruction","radiofrequency data","envelope data","log-converted data","signal distribution","sparse representation","sparsifying efficiency","restored image quality","field II simulation","speckle generating phantoms","hyperechoic cyst","resampled image data","original image reduction rate","convex optimization algorithm","sparse transformation","CDF 5/3 wavelet","feature recognition","log-converted data","mean-square-error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ultrasound imaging","compressed sensing","data acquisition time","sparse representation"]}],"abstract":"In this work, we investigate performance of reconstruction on different ultrasound (US) post-beamformed data when performing compressed sensing (CS) with fewer measurements. Three types of post-beamformed data - radio frequency (RF), envelope, and log-converted data are used. Each data type has its own signal distribution, which, given a typical sparse representation, affects sparsifying efficiency during CS reconstruction and hence further determines restored image quality. Field II simulation of a speckle generating phantoms with a hyperechoic cyst is performed. The re-sampled image data used for evaluation of reconstruction performance has 75% data reduction rate from the original image. Here reconstruction is performed using convex optimization algorithm along the lateral direction and sparse transformation with CDF 5/3 wavelet is typically chosen. The results show that for feature recognition, reconstructions on post-beamformed RF and envelope data have close performance, and are better than that on log-converted data.

Such technique, known as micro-beamforming, involves the application of a delay-and-sum beamforming to small groups of adjacent array elements using dedicated electronics. In this paper we show that, due to the electrostatic spring-softening effect, the phase response of Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers (CMUTs) can be controlled by varying the bias voltage. Based on this phenomenon, we propose a phase shift micro-beamforming method of CMUT arrays. We analyze the performance obtainable by applying this method to a typical phased array configuration for medical imaging. We show that, with relatively high quality factor CMUTs that still allow broadband immersion operation, it is possible to obtain up to 90\u00b0 phase shifts by varying the bias voltage. Further, by inverting the sign of the bias voltage, we show that it is possible to obtain an additional 180\u00b0 phase shift. Simulation results show that, with a 40% -3 dB one-way fractional bandwidth CMUT, the grating lobe level of the transmission radiation patterns, obtained with the proposed micro-beamforming technique, may be kept below -23 dB using broadband excitation signals for maximum steering angles of \u00b145\u00b0.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725090/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14061770","htmlLink":"/document/6725090/","conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Phase shift micro-beamforming of CMUT arrays using the spring-softening effect","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase shift micro-beamforming of CMUT arrays using the spring-softening effect","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"UFFC2013001431.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043884S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6708499","isNumber":"6724747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6708499","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6724747","articleId":"6725090","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6725091,"authors":[{"name":"Wentao Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland"],"lastName":"Wentao Jiang","id":"37087706783"},{"name":"William M.

Therefore, a lossless compression associated with fully parallel decoding scheme on graphics processing units (GPU) is proposed in this study to mitigate the transmission bandwidth of hardware interface, and is used to reduce the overall processing time of data transfers in a GPU. In our simulations, the compression ratio reached around 3 to 4 by combining demodulation, decimation and our proposed lossless compression.

It provides significant reductions in sampling rate with minimal loss in image quality. In this investigation, a CS-based sampling scheme is introduced for ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation (NDE) signals. The feasibility of parameter estimation based on the new sampling method is explored. Especially, a two-step compressed sensing with Gaussian chirplet model is proposed for data acquisition and echo parameter estimation. The CS framework is utilized to estimate the time-of-arrivals (TOAs) of chirplets. With the estimated TOAs, another iteration of data acquisition is performed to acquire the echo amplitude accurately. It has been shown that the two-step CS can estimate the TOAs of ultrasonic echoes with high accuracy in the presence of noise with SNR as low as -5 dB. Furthermore, the estimation is robust to inaccurate knowledge of the transducer bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0248","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6708499/6724747/06725157.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0248","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724747","startPage":"966","endPage":"969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Echo parameter estimation for ultrasonic NDE applications via a two-step compressed sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Echo parameter estimation for ultrasonic NDE applications via a two-step compressed sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725157/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14062064","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6725157/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Echo parameter estimation for ultrasonic NDE applications via a two-step compressed sensing","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"UFFC2013001716.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059189S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6708499","isNumber":"6724747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6708499","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6724747","articleId":"6725157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6725169,"authors":[{"name":"Hayong Jung","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA"],"firstName":"Hayong","lastName":"Jung","id":"37070955900"},{"name":"Hojong Choi","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA"],"firstName":"Hojong","lastName":"Choi","id":"37713701700"},{"name":"K.

The main objective is to improve both transmit and receive sensitivity by lowering the center-to-average displacement ratio, which for bending plate operated devices inherently is limited. In addition, for receive mode the force generated from the impinging sound pressure wave is concentrated to the center of the plate, resulting in larger signals and, in contrast to piston-shaped plates, the horn has the advantage of only moderately increasing the modal mass of the structure. By using finite element analysis and first sound pressure measurements of our modified CMUT, we demonstrate that this idea is feasible and promising for air-coupled CMUTs operating at frequencies below 150 kHz, as it has been been proven to be successful for commercially available piezoelectric-driven bending plate devices as well.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0074","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0074","startPage":"287","endPage":"290","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6708499/6724747/06725171.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724747","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite element analysis of mechanically amplified CMUTs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Finite element analysis of mechanically amplified CMUTs","conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6725171/","accessionNumber":"14062075","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725171/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite element analysis of mechanically amplified CMUTs","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"UFFC2013001757.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047185S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6708499","isNumber":"6724747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6708499","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6724747","articleId":"6725171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6725180,"authors":[{"name":"Suhyun Park","affiliation":["Medical System Lab, Samsung Electronics Co, Yong-in, South Korea"],"lastName":"Suhyun Park","id":"37071478400"},{"name":"Bae-Hyung Kim","affiliation":["Medical System Lab, Samsung Electronics Co, Yong-in, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bae-Hyung","lastName":"Kim","id":"38552255400"},{"name":"Seunghun Lee","affiliation":["Medical System Lab, Samsung Electronics Co, Yong-in, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seunghun","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086765836"},{"name":"Youngil Kim","affiliation":["Medical System Lab, Samsung Electronics Co, Yong-in, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youngil","lastName":"Kim","id":"38553093300"},{"name":"Kyungil Cho","affiliation":["Medical System Lab, Samsung Electronics Co, Yong-in, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyungil","lastName":"Cho","id":"38549951800"},{"name":"Taeho Jeon","affiliation":["Medical System Lab, Samsung Electronics Co, Yong-in, South Korea"],"firstName":"Taeho","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37086133977"},{"name":"Jongkeun Song","affiliation":["Medical System Lab, Samsung Electronics Co, Yong-in, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jongkeun","lastName":"Song","id":"38555233000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5686-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5684-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-0117"}],"articleNumber":"6725180","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":368},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Imaging","Arrays","Nickel","IEL","Hardware","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic imaging","array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beamforming","imageforming","3D ultrasound imaging system","2D CMUT-on-ASIC arrays","3D volume imaging methods","theoretical analysis","elevational synthetic focusing method","electric wobbling method","real-time volumetric imaging system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["2-D CMUT arrays","3-D ultrasound imaging system","2-D array design","3-D Beamforming","Front-end ASIC"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamforming and imageforming for 3D ultrasound imaging system using 2-D CMUT-on-ASIC arrays","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724747","endPage":"1451","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6708499/6724747/06725180.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0367","startPage":"1448","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725180","abstract":"For real-time volumetric imaging system using 2-D arrays, control of massive ultrasound data acquired from a large number of system channels is challenging.

Most of the coupling of mode models and P matrix models use parameters obtained from a single electrode periodic transducer analysis. In the case of complex electro acoustical cells (like HanmaHunsinger cells), it is sometimes necessary to obtain the COM parameters from the analysis of the entire electro acoustical cell, which means assuming that the filter contains an infinite array of identical electro acoustical cells the elementary cell of which is made of several electrodes. At the 2011 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium, an original coupled Finite Element Model/Boundary Integral Equation (FEM/BIE) was presented in order to simulate an infinite array of single metallic electrodes [1]. In this paper, a generalization of this model to elementary cells more complex than one electrode will be presented. Like in the 2011 publication, the Finite Element Method is used for the finite part of geometry (the electrodes, part of the dielectric, and part of the piezoelectric substrate), while the semi infinite part of the geometry (piezoelectric part, and dielectric part) are taken into account using a Boundary Integral Equation. The theoretical and the numerical parts of the model will be presented, as well as Coupling of Modes or P matrix parameters determination for Hanma-Hunsinger low loss cells with various substrate materials and orientations. Using the results of the FEM/BIE analysis, a simulation of a filter containing modified Hanma-Hunsinger electro acoustical cells is made and is compared with measurements.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of SAW transducer having aperiodic multi-electrode cells using a coupled FEM/BIE numerical model","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0270","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6708499/6724747/06725188.pdf","startPage":"1053","endPage":"1056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724747","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725188","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725188/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of SAW transducer having aperiodic multi-electrode cells using a coupled FEM/BIE numerical model","conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6725188/","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14061687","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of SAW transducer having aperiodic multi-electrode cells using a coupled FEM/BIE numerical model","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"UFFC2013001823.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048778S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6708499","isNumber":"6724747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6708499","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6724747","articleId":"6725188","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6725210,"authors":[{"name":"Mahdi Tabassian","affiliation":["Dep. of Electrical, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Tabassian","id":"38193742600"},{"name":"Francesca Galluzzo","affiliation":["Dep. of Electrical, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesca","lastName":"Galluzzo","id":"37704747000"},{"name":"Luca De Marchi","affiliation":["Dep. of Electrical, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"De Marchi","id":"37400003200"},{"name":"Nicolo' Speciale","affiliation":["Dep. of Electrical, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicolo'","lastName":"Speciale","id":"37269334800"},{"name":"Guido Masetti","affiliation":["Dep. of Electrical, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Guido","lastName":"Masetti","id":"37269332100"},{"name":"Nicola Testoni","affiliation":["Dep. of Civil, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Testoni","id":"37397136400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5686-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5684-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-0117"}],"articleNumber":"6725210","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biopsy","Feature extraction","Classification algorithms","Training","Prototypes","Prostate cancer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological organs","biological specimen preparation","biological tissues","biomedical ultrasonics","cancer","feature extraction","graphics processing units","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing","parallel architectures","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft-label reinforced rtCAB","guided prostate tissue sampling","real-time computer-aided biopsy system","prostate cancer diagnosis","feature extraction","trans-rectal ultrasound data","ensemble learning algorithm","classification phase","label assignment method","uncertain data soft class labels","uncertain data crisp class labels","GPU","CUDA platform","semisupervised classifiers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["computer-aided biopsy","prostate cancer","label assignment","ensemble learning","ultrasound images"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725210","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0226","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724747","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6708499/6724747/06725210.pdf","startPage":"880","endPage":"883","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft-label reinforced rtCAB for guided prostate tissue sampling","abstract":"In this paper a real-time computer-aided biopsy (rtCAB) system is presented to support prostate cancer diagnosis.

However, the computational demand and the need for access to channel data has made real-time implementation difficult. GPU computing can significantly improve computational throughput, but has been used primarily to accelerate offline image processing. By implementing the SLSC algorithm on 3 GPUs and integrating it with a Verasonics ultrasound scanner, we have realized a real-time simultaneous B-mode and SLSC imaging system. We demonstrate the real-time imaging capabilities on an in vivo liver, gallbladder, and carotid artery and present snapshots of the on-screen display. The SLSC images were found to suppress clutter and showed a more homogeneous texture in tissue when compared to the B-mode images. Computation time and imaging frame rate were highly dependent on the imaging parameters. When imaging the liver, 46 transmit beams with a range of 10 cm were obtained at 6.7 fps for standard imaging and at 2.1 fps for harmonic imaging. A frame rate of 5.9 fps was achieved for carotid artery imaging with 129 transmit beams and a range of 3 cm. By restricting the field of view to 65 transmit beams and a range of 2 cm, a frame rate of 12.5 fps was achieved. Further increases in frame rates can be attained with additional system development and improvements to hardware.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0327","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6708499/6724747/06725220.pdf","startPage":"1280","endPage":"1283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724747","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"In vivo demonstration of a real-time simultaneous B-mode/spatial coherence GPU-based beamformer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725220","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725220/","displayDocTitle":"In vivo demonstration of a real-time simultaneous B-mode/spatial coherence GPU-based beamformer","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14061607","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6725220/","conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In vivo demonstration of a real-time simultaneous B-mode/spatial coherence GPU-based beamformer","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"UFFC2013001981.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092627S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6708499","isNumber":"6724747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6708499","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6724747","articleId":"6725220","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6725246,"authors":[{"name":"Steffen H.

This has an impact on high resolution morphological images and increasingly on highly sensitive functional MRI. MR-inherent compensation techniques like navigator echoes and methods like ECG or respiratory gating can reduce these artifacts but are indirect methods monitoring surrogates and not very reliable indicating the actual organ positions. To improve MR imaging of moving organs we propose diagnostic ultrasound (US) as additional imaging method for organ motion detection and compensation during MRI scanning. We developed an MRI compatible US platform to enable non-invasive hybrid MR-US-imaging and real-time US-motion compensation. The ultrasound system and the transducers have to be insensitive to the high electromagnetic fields like we find them outside and inside the tomograph and they may not interfere with the MR-system electromagnetically. In this work, our US research platform and special ultrasound transducers are presented that meet these requirements consisting of the beamformer unit, a special LCD display for use close to the MR-magnet, special ultrasound probes (T-shaped 2\u00d764 element phased array transducers) and a separate PC to be used in the control room of the MRI scanner. The system can use multiple transducers in parallel mode to acquire up to 4 US images simultaneously. Tracking of moving structures in the ultrasound images is performed by a stochastic tracking algorithm, which fits a contour to the ultrasound data using affine transformations in real-time. Interferences of the US system with the MR scanner were measured and characterized. It was possible to make simultaneous measurements (US and MRI) next to and inside the MRT system to reconstruct US motion compensated MR volumes. The interferences in the ultrasound imaging induced by the MRT system can be neglected. The effects of EMC emissions by the US device on the MRT system are measured and characterized. Data acquisition was done in parallel to the MRI scan of organ movements inside the body. The setup was tested in a 1.5 T and a 3 T MRI systems and first ultrasound compensated MR volumes were acquired.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725246/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14061919","publicationDate":"July 2013","conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6725246/","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"MR-compatible ultrasound research platform for motion tracking to reduce motion induced artifacts in MR imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MR-compatible ultrasound research platform for motion tracking to reduce motion induced artifacts in MR imaging","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"UFFC2013002140.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052628S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6708499","isNumber":"6724747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6708499","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6724747","articleId":"6725246","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6725248,"authors":[{"name":"Tom Bruyneel","affiliation":["Trisco IT Consultacy, Sint-Denijs-Westrem, Belgium"],"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Bruyneel","id":"37086721397"},{"name":"Alejandra Ortega","affiliation":["Cardiovascular imaging & dynamics, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Alejandra","lastName":"Ortega","id":"37085491247"},{"name":"Ling Tong","affiliation":["Cardiovascular imaging & dynamics, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Tong","id":"37071662500"},{"name":"Jan D'hooge","affiliation":["Cardiovascular imaging & dynamics, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"D'hooge","id":"37277201000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5686-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5684-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-0117"}],"articleNumber":"6725248","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Array signal processing","Azimuth","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic waves","echo","graphics processing units","transient response","ultrasonic transducer arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPU-based implementation","spatial impulse response method","pulse-echo response","linear sound field simulation tool","spatial impulse response fields","SIR method","2D array transducers","modern hardware","parallel computing nodes","parallelization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D ultrasound imaging","2D matrix array tranducers","GPU"]}],"abstract":"A commonly used program for the simulation of linear sound fields and pulse-echo responses of transducers is FieldII which is based on the spatial impulse response (SIR) method.

The development of an in situ health monitoring system that can inspect large areas and communicate remotely to the inspector is highly computational demanding due to both the huge number of piezoelectric sensors needed and the high sampling frequency. To address this problem, a general approach for low rate sampling is developed. Compressive Sensing (CS) has emerged as a potentially viable technique for the efficient acquisition that exploits the sparse representation of dispersive ultrasonic guided waves in the frequency warped basis. The framework is applied to lower the sampling frequency and to enhance defect localization performances of Lamb wave inspection systems. As a result, an automatic detection procedure to locate defect-induced reflections was demonstrated and successfully tested on simulated Lamb waves propagating in a carbon fiber plate using PZFlex software. The proposed method is suitable for defect detection and can be easily implemented for real application to structural health monitoring.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0041","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6708499/6724747/06725272.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724747","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing with frequency warped compensation for damage detection in composite plate","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725272","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725272/","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing with frequency warped compensation for damage detection in composite plate","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14062076","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6725272/","conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing with frequency warped compensation for damage detection in composite plate","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"UFFC2013002296.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059219S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6708499","isNumber":"6724747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6708499","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6724747","articleId":"6725272","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6725277,"authors":[{"name":"Junseob Shin","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Junseob","lastName":"Shin","id":"38469347700"},{"name":"Jesse T.

Previous studies have shown that its performance in terms of contrast enhancement diminishes with increasing level of phase aberration and has a tendency to create image artifacts. In this work, we propose a modified version of DAX, known as Phase Apodization with Cross-correlation (PAX), which utilizes sinusoidal phase apodization to further enhance image quality. Our preliminary simulation and experimental results presented in this work showed that PAX performs in a more robust manner than DAX, especially with increased level of phase aberration, to further improve image contrast and reduce image artifacts.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clutter suppression using Phase Apodization with Cross-correlation in ultrasound imaging","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0204","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6708499/6724747/06725277.pdf","startPage":"793","endPage":"796","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724747","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725277","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725277/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Clutter suppression using Phase Apodization with Cross-correlation in ultrasound imaging","conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6725277/","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14061811","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clutter suppression using Phase Apodization with Cross-correlation in ultrasound imaging","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"UFFC2013002327.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054965S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6708499","isNumber":"6724747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6708499","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6724747","articleId":"6725277","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6725283,"authors":[{"name":"Jianguo Ma","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"lastName":"Jianguo Ma","id":"37087350878"},{"name":"Xiaoning Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaoning Jiang","id":"37087350545"},{"name":"K.

Currently, however, contrast enhanced intravascular ultrasound (CE-IVUS) imaging has not been used clinically. Design, fabrication, and characterization of a small aperture (0.6 \u00d7 3 mm), dual frequency ultrasound transducer were performed, followed by microbubble tests for viability study of CE-IVUS imaging. Results show that more than 1.23 MPa (mechanical index: 0.48) was generated by the 6.5 MHz transmission component at the imaging area, where nonlinear response of microbubbles was detected by the 30 MHz broadband (-6dB bandwidth: 58.6%) receiving component. Nonlinear echo response from microbubbles flowing through a micro-tube with diameter of 0.2 mm was clearly detected with a signal to noise ratio higher than 12 dB. These promising results show that small aperture, dual frequency transducers are capable of detecting contrast agents using split frequency detection methods and suggest they are a reasonable platform for CE-IVUS imaging.","pdfPath":"/iel7/6708499/6724747/06725283.pdf","startPage":"769","endPage":"772","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6724747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0198","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0198","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725283","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transducers","Imaging","Ultrasonic imaging","Harmonic analysis","Resonant frequency","Electron tubes","Apertures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical transducers","biomedical ultrasonics","bubbles","cardiovascular system","diseases","microfluidics","ultrasonic transducers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intravascular contrast imaging","cardiovascular diseases","signal to noise ratio images","plaque vascularization degree","molecular function","contrast enhanced intravascular ultrasound imaging","transducer design","transducer fabrication","transducer characterization","small aperture dual frequency ultrasound transducer","microbubble tests","viability study","CE-IVUS imaging","mechanical index","transmission component","imaging area","microbubble nonlinear response","broadband receiving component","nonlinear echo response","microbubble flow","microtube","contrast agent detection","split frequency detection method","size 0.6 mm","size 3 mm","frequency 6.5 MHz","frequency 30 MHz","size 0.2 mm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ultrasound transducer","dual frequency","ultrasound contrast agent","intravascular","ultrasound imaging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725283/","displayDocTitle":"Small aperture, dual frequency ultrasound transducers for intravascular contrast imaging","accessionNumber":"14062045","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","publicationDate":"July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6725283/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2013","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small aperture, dual frequency ultrasound transducers for intravascular contrast imaging","confLoc":"Prague","sourcePdf":"UFFC2013002370.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051268S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6708499","isNumber":"6724747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6708499","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6724747","articleId":"6725283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":6725325,"authors":[{"name":"Yasir Mehmood","affiliation":["SEECS, National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Yasir","lastName":"Mehmood","id":"37590566800"},{"name":"Muhammad Awais Shibli","affiliation":["SEECS, National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muhammad Awais","lastName":"Shibli","id":"37299816700"},{"name":"Umme Habiba","affiliation":["SEECS, National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Umme","lastName":"Habiba","id":"37085489155"},{"name":"Rahat Masood","affiliation":["SEECS, National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Rahat","lastName":"Masood","id":"38303635500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1288-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1287-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6725325","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1416},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Intrusion detection","Virtual machine monitors","Computer crime","Ports (Computers)","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer crime","data privacy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","IT organization","pay-per-use based services","privacy","open architecture","distributed architecture","IDS","attacks detection","cloud based intrusion detection systems","positioning","detection time","detection technique","data source","security requirements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Cloud Security","Intrusion Detection System","Signature","Anomaly"]}],"abstract":"Today, Cloud Computing is the preferred choice of every IT organization since it provides flexible and pay-per-use based services to its users.

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is the most commonly used mechanism to detect attacks on cloud. This paper provides an overview of different intrusions in cloud. Then, we analyze some existing cloud based intrusion detection systems (IDS) with respect to their type, positioning, detection time, detection technique, data source and attacks they can detect. The analysis also provides limitations of each technique to evaluate whether they fulfill the security requirements of cloud computing environment or not. We emphasize the deployment of IDS that uses multiple detection methods to cope with security challenges in cloud.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intrusion Detection System in Cloud Computing: Challenges and opportunities","publicationTitle":"2013 2nd National Conference on Information Assurance (NCIA)","doi":"10.1109/NCIA.2013.6725325","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 2nd National Conference on Information Assurance (NCIA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6714723/6725308/06725325.pdf","startPage":"59","endPage":"66","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCIA.2013.6725325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6725308","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725325","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725325/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Intrusion Detection System in Cloud Computing: Challenges and opportunities","conferenceDate":"11-12 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6725325/","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14082304","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intrusion Detection System in Cloud Computing: Challenges and opportunities","confLoc":"Rawalpindi, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"09IntrusionDetectionMehmood3033493.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118193S","chronDate":"11-12 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6714723","isNumber":"6725308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6714723","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6725308","articleId":"6725325","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6725337,"authors":[{"name":"Tariq Mahmood","affiliation":["College of Computing, Information Sciences Karachi Institute of Economics & Technology, Karachi, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Tariq","lastName":"Mahmood","id":"37296175900"},{"name":"Uzma Afzal","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science and Technology, Karachi, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Uzma","lastName":"Afzal","id":"37085459865"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1288-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1287-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6725337","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":74,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6684},"abstract":"The rapid growth of the Internet has brought with it an exponential increase in the type and frequency of cyber attacks. Many well-known cybersecurity solutions are in place to counteract these attacks. However, the generation of Big Data over computer networks is rapidly rendering these traditional solutions obsolete. To cater for this problem, corporate research is now focusing on Security Analytics, i.e., the application of Big Data Analytics techniques to cybersecurity. Analytics can assist network managers particularly in the monitoring and surveillance of real-time network streams and real-time detection of both malicious and suspicious (outlying) patterns. Such a behavior is envisioned to encompass and enhance all traditional security techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the state of the art of Security Analytics, i.e., its description, technology, trends, and tools. It hence aims to convince the reader of the imminent application of analytics as an unparalleled cybersecurity solution in the near future.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 2nd National Conference on Information Assurance (NCIA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6714723/6725308/06725337.pdf","startPage":"129","endPage":"134","publicationTitle":"2013 2nd National Conference on Information Assurance (NCIA)","doi":"10.1109/NCIA.2013.6725337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCIA.2013.6725337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6725308","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security Analytics: Big Data Analytics for cybersecurity: A review of trends, techniques and tools","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Information management","Data handling","Data storage systems","Computer security","Real-time systems","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","computer network security","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security analytics","big data analytics","cybersecurity","Internet","cyber attack","computer network","real-time network stream","real-time detection","malicious pattern","suspicious pattern"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cybersecurity","big data analytics","security analytics","survey","real-time","suspicion","fraud","outliers","network streams"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725337/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Security Analytics: Big Data Analytics for cybersecurity: A review of trends, techniques and tools","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6725337/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14082303","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2014","conferenceDate":"11-12 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security Analytics: Big Data Analytics for cybersecurity: A review of trends, techniques and tools","confLoc":"Rawalpindi, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"21DrTariq.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052744S","chronDate":"11-12 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6714723","isNumber":"6725308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6714723","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"6725308","articleId":"6725337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6725344,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Researchers are currently moving from resistive device development to memory circuit design and implementation, hoping to fabricate memory chips that can be deployed in the market in the near future. However, so far the low manufacturing yield is still a major issue. In this paper, we propose defect and fault models specific to RRAM, i.e., the Over-Forming (OF) defect and the Read-One-Disturb (R1D) fault. We then propose a March algorithm to cover these defects and faults in addition to the conventional RAM faults, which is called March C*. We also develop a novel squeeze-search scheme to identify the OF defect, which leads to the Stuck-At Fault (SAF). The proposed test algorithm is applied to a first-cut 4-Mb HfO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n-based RRAM test chip. Results show that OF defects and R1D faults do exist in the RRAM chip. We also identify specific failure patterns from the test results, which are shown to be induced by multiple short defects between bit-lines. By identifying the defects and faults, designers and process engineers can improve the RRAM yield in a more cost-effective way.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2014.12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2014.12","startPage":"180","endPage":"190","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/6980145/06725492.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6980145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RRAM Defect Modeling and Failure Analysis Based on March Test and a Novel Squeeze-Search Scheme","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725492/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 1 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"RRAM Defect Modeling and Failure Analysis Based on March Test and a Novel Squeeze-Search Scheme","volume":"64","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14810420","publicationDate":"1 Jan. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6725492/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RRAM Defect Modeling and Failure Analysis Based on March Test and a Novel Squeeze-Search Scheme","sourcePdf":"tc-chen-1200-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.211721S","chronDate":"Jan. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6980145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"6980145","articleId":"6725492","onlineDate":"27 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6725565,"authors":[{"name":"Jinkyu Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6776574/6725565/6725565-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jinkyu Kang received the B.S. degrees in Electrical Communications Engineering and the M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering from from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2009 and 2011, respectively.

Focusing on the uplink, an effective solution for the communication between BSs and the corresponding CU on the backhaul links is based on compressing and forwarding the baseband received signal from each BS. In the presence of ergodic fading, communicating the channel state information (CSI) from the BSs to the CU may require a sizable part of the backhaul capacity. In a prior work, this aspect was studied by assuming a Compress-Forward-Estimate (CFE) approach, whereby the BSs compress the training signal and CSI estimation takes place at the CU. In this work, instead, an Estimate-Compress-Forward (ECF) approach is investigated, whereby the BSs perform CSI estimation and forward a compressed version of the CSI to the CU. This choice is motivated by the information theoretic optimality of separate estimation and compression. Various ECF strategies are proposed that perform either separate or joint compression of estimated CSI and received signal. Moreover, the proposed strategies are combined with distributed source coding when considering multiple BSs. \"Semi-coherent\" strategies are also proposed that do not convey any CSI or training information on the backhaul links. Via numerical results, it is shown that a proper design of ECF strategies based on joint received signal and estimated CSI compression or of semi-coherent schemes leads to substantial performance gains compared to more conventional approaches based on non-coherent transmission or the CFE approach.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.012114.131004","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6776574/06725565.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.012114.131004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776574","startPage":"1555","endPage":"1567","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Signal and Channel State Information Compression for the Backhaul of Uplink Network MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725565","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint Signal and Channel State Information Compression for the Backhaul of Uplink Network MIMO Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725565/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14181461","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6725565/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Signal and Channel State Information Compression for the Backhaul of Uplink Network MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"1555-tw1403-kang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1512S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6776574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6776574","articleId":"6725565","onlineDate":"27 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6725566,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Li","affiliation":["University of Texas at Dallas"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Aria Nosratinia","affiliation":["University of Texas at Dallas"],"firstName":"Aria","lastName":"Nosratinia"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"6725566","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":389},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Antennas","Coherence","Decoding","Training","Time division multiple access"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CSIR","superposition","degrees of freedom","pilot","channel estimation"]}],"abstract":"In a two-user broadcast channel where one user has full CSIR and the other has none, a recent result showed that TDMA is strictly suboptimal and a product superposition requiring non-coherent signaling achieves DoF gains under many antenna configurations.

For instance, the nonlinearity of the power amplifier (PA) causes nonlinear interference to the PRs. This paper studies the power allocation in cognitive radio networks by considering the nonlinear effects of the PA on the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the secondary receiver (SR) and the adjacent channel interference (ACI) to the PRs. A nonlinear PA with limited dynamic range and a lower limit on the transmit power is assumed for the secondary transmitter (ST). To control the resulting ACI from the ST to the PRs, the PA needs to be turned off in some fading blocks. To investigate the throughput, an analytical expression for the probability of data transmission between the secondary users is derived as a function of the interference temperature limits of the PRs. All analyses are performed for both peak and average ACI power constraints. Through theoretical analysis and simulation studies, maximum achievable average SNR at the SR is investigated. Moreover, the throughput degradation is studied and it is observed that the average ACI power constraints result in the better performance than the peak ones.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725571/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"62","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2014","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2014","accessionNumber":"14128268","htmlLink":"/document/6725571/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the Power Amplifier Nonlinearity on the Power Allocation in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the Power Amplifier Nonlinearity on the Power Allocation in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"467-tc1402-majidi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109105S","chronDate":"February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6748342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6748342","articleId":"6725571","onlineDate":"27 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6725572,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed R.

The mutual interference between macrocells and femtocells arises as a result of decentralized femtocell deployment and backhaul delay. To mitigate downlink interference between the femtocell clients, known as Home User Equipments (HUEs), and macrocell clients, known as Macrocell User Equipments (MUEs), we present methods of dynamic distributed beamforming that are fully compatible with MIMO precoding mechanisms in existing LTE standard releases. We develop three MIMO beamforming schemes for interference mitigation that take into account the Quality of Service (QoS) requirement of both femtocell and macrocell clients. These new heterogeneous MIMO precoding strategies improve flexibility in resource provisioning and signaling requirement while responding to different QoS needs. We also present MUE mean throughput analysis by applying order statistics to our proposed methods. Moreover, we provide an approximate closed form for the mean throughput in terms of basic transmitter, channel, and receiver parameters. Furthermore, we extend our proposed interference control precoding schemes to spatial multiplexing for MIMO transmissions. Finally, we extend our solution to tackle the more general case involving multiple MUEs, multiple HUEs, and multiple femtocells.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic MIMO Precoding for Femtocell Interference Mitigation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.122913.130062","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6748342/06725572.pdf","startPage":"648","endPage":"666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.122913.130062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6748342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725572","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725572/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2014","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic MIMO Precoding for Femtocell Interference Mitigation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6725572/","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2014","publicationDate":"February 2014","accessionNumber":"14128276","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic MIMO Precoding for Femtocell Interference Mitigation","sourcePdf":"648-tc1402-ahmed.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096254S","chronDate":"February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6748342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6748342","articleId":"6725572","onlineDate":"27 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6725573,"authors":[{"name":"Xueqin Jiang","affiliation":["Dong Hua University, Engineering Research Center of Digitized Textile and Fashion Technology, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6748342/6725573/6725573-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xueqin Jiang received the B.S degree Nanjing Institute of Technology, Nanjing Jiangsu, P.R.

This approach is simple but the complexity of the PEG algorithm scale is O(nm), where n is the number of symbol nodes and m is the number of check nodes. We deal with this problem by construct a base matrix H\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">b</sub>\n of size m\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">b</sub>\n \u00d7 n\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">b</sub>\n with the PEG algorithm and simultaneously expand this base matrix into a parity-check matrix H of size mx n via the the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT), where m \u226b m\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">b</sub>\n and n \u2265 n\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">b</sub>\n. The size of the base matrix is expanded without decreasing the girth. For convenience, the PEG and CRT combined algorithm is referred to as the PEG-CRT algorithm in this paper. Since a smaller matrix is constructed with the PEG algorithm and the complexity of the CRT computation is negligible compared to the PEG algorithm, the complexity of the whole code construction process is reduced. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm has a potential advantage of saving storage space by storing a smaller matrix H\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">b</sub>\n and expanding it to H \"on-the-fly\" in hardware. The expanded matrix H preserves the important properties of base matrix such as large girth, flexible code rate and low density. The complexity analysis shows that the complexity of the PEG-CRT algorithm does not grow with the code length n. Simulation results show that compared with the PEG LDPC codes of length n\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">b</sub>\n, the expanded PEG-CRT LDPC codes have better bit error rate (BER) performance with the iterative decoding. It is also shown that compared with PEG LDPC codes of length n, which constructed with higher complexities, the PEG-CRT codes have similar BER performance.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.011114.130285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.011114.130285","startPage":"442","endPage":"451","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6748342/06725573.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6748342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Progressive Edge-Growth Algorithm Based on Chinese Remainder Theorem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725573/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Progressive Edge-Growth Algorithm Based on Chinese Remainder Theorem","volume":"62","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2014","accessionNumber":"14128291","publicationDate":"February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6725573/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Progressive Edge-Growth Algorithm Based on Chinese Remainder Theorem","sourcePdf":"442-tc1402-jiang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084932S","chronDate":"February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6748342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6748342","articleId":"6725573","onlineDate":"27 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6725574,"authors":[{"name":"Hojae Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6748342/6725574/6725574-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hojae Lee was born in Korea in 1984.

Nevertheless, as more transmitters get involved in cooperation, the complexity associated with the selection of multi-dimensional parameters increases exponentially. In this work, we investigate efficient multi-cell cooperation based on CoMP-joint processing and transmission (CoMP-JPT) with orthogonal beamforming using limited feedback. Through the utilization of combinatorial optimization, optimal user scheduling for joint transmission via multiple transmitters is accomplished, while the computational complexity is significantly reduced. In particular, a generalized beam assignment problem (GBAP) is formulated and solved using a combinatorial algorithm that is generalized in terms of the number of transmitters o\\mathcal{B}o. The performance of the combinatorial orthogonal beamforming (COBF) scheme is mathematically analyzed so as to demonstrate its superiority and capability to maintain fairness among users in a multi-cell environment. In the simulation results, a performance gain of more than 50% for cell-edge users is obtained without a loss in the average throughput for the total number of users. In addition, the COBF method can reduce the complexity by more than 60% when compared to the conventional exhaustive search technique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725574/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","volume":"62","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"14128274","publicationDate":"February 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6725574/","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2014","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Combinatorial Orthogonal Beamforming for Joint Processing and Transmission","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combinatorial Orthogonal Beamforming for Joint Processing and Transmission","sourcePdf":"625-tc1402-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086385S","chronDate":"February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6748342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6748342","articleId":"6725574","onlineDate":"27 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6725575,"authors":[{"name":"Guanghui Song","affiliation":["Dept. of Intelligent Information Eng and sci., Doshisha University, Kyoto, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6777265/6725575/6725575-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guanghui Song (M'13) received the B.S. degree in communication and engineering from Henan Normal University, Xinxiang, China, in 2006.

This coding gain increases with the field order.

The equivalent single-input single-output (SISO) scalar model is introduced and this then is used to construct a model for the nonlinear MIMO-OFDM system. Based on an unique inter-modulation product (IMP) analysis, it is shown how the receiver signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) may be derived to a polynomial based function of the system operating point. It is also shown that expressions for the asymptotical behavior of this SNR, when the linear and highly nonlinear PA operations are applied, may also be derived. Based on these derivations, it is further shown that the optimal system operating point, which corresponds to the maximum receiver SNR and SEP lower bound, can be identified and be derived to a polynomial based expression. Additionally, a general expression for the different integral expressions of SEP for the phase shift keying (PSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signals is found. By means of these analytical results, it was found possible to advance analytical explanations of observed behaviour in simulations and also to provide a practical analysis of performance optimization of nonlinear MIMO-OFDM systems.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.010414.130533","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6777265/06725578.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.010414.130533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777265","startPage":"930","endPage":"938","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Practical Analysis of Performance Optimization in OSTBC Based Nonlinear MIMO-OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725578","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Practical Analysis of Performance Optimization in OSTBC Based Nonlinear MIMO-OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725578/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14236058","dateOfInsertion":"25 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6725578/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Practical Analysis of Performance Optimization in OSTBC Based Nonlinear MIMO-OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"0930-tc1403-lei.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068071S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6777265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6777265","articleId":"6725578","onlineDate":"27 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6725579,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6776574/6725579/6725579-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiang Chen (S'09) received the B.E. degree in electronics and information engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2008.

The use of relays introduces additional freedoms to manage the interference and can enhance the DoF performance. However, the characterization of the DoF regions with relays is much more complicated and is not available in the literature. In this paper, we shall investigate the DoF of the dual-hop MIMO IC via interference alignment. Based on the solvability of the alignment conditions, the upper bound for the maximum achievable DoF tuple is obtained. To evaluate the tightness of the derived bound, we further propose an iterative algorithm to determine the processing matrices at the sources, relays, and destinations for a given feasible DoF tuple. It is shown that the proposed algorithm can achieve the upper bound for the sum DoF in the low and high DoF regions, where the achievability indicates that the upper bound indeed gives the maximum sum DoF. It is also found that despite the DoF loss caused by the half-duplexity assumption, the dual-hop IC with sufficient number of relays can still outperform the conventional single-hop IC under most circumstances.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.012114.121952","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6776574/06725579.pdf","startPage":"1274","endPage":"1283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.012114.121952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776574","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Alignment in Dual-Hop MIMO Interference Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725579","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725579/","displayDocTitle":"Interference Alignment in Dual-Hop MIMO Interference Channel","volume":"13","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14181448","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6725579/","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Alignment in Dual-Hop MIMO Interference Channel","sourcePdf":"1274-tw1403-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115575S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6776574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6776574","articleId":"6725579","onlineDate":"27 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6725582,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Hao Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6776574/6725582/6725582-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jin-Hao Li received the B.S. degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics from the National Cheng-Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 2006, the M.S. degree in Communication Engineering from the National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree in Communication Engineering from the National Taiwan University, Taipei, Tai-wan, in 2013.

This incurs a large aggregate feedback bandwidth which grows linearly with the number of users. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to reduce feedback load in a scheduled downlink orthogonal beamforming system by allowing users to opportunistically determine the number of feedback bits to use according to multiple decision thresholds. Through theoretical analysis, we show that, while keeping the aggregate feedback load of the entire system constant regardless of the number of users, the proposed scheme almost achieves the optimal asymptotic sum rate scaling with respect to the number of users (i.e., the multiuser diversity). Specifically, given the number of thresholds, the proposed scheme can achieve a constant portion of the optimal sum rate achievable by the system in which all the users always feedback, and the remaining portion (i.e., the sum rate loss) decreases exponentially to zero as the number of thresholds increases. We further consider feedback design by minimizing the number of thresholds and allocating quantization bits. Simulation shows that the proposed scheme can reduce feedback load and utilize limited feedback bandwidth more effectively than the existing feedback methods.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.012414.130359","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6776574/06725582.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.012414.130359","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776574","startPage":"1321","endPage":"1333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Feedback Reduction for Multiuser MIMO Broadcast Channel with Orthogonal Beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725582","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Feedback Reduction for Multiuser MIMO Broadcast Channel with Orthogonal Beamforming","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725582/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14181445","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6725582/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Feedback Reduction for Multiuser MIMO Broadcast Channel with Orthogonal Beamforming","sourcePdf":"1321-tw1403-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068569S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6776574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6776574","articleId":"6725582","onlineDate":"27 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6725584,"authors":[{"name":"Tobias Breddermann","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Systems and Data Processing, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6776574/6725584/6725584-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tobias Breddermann received the Dipl.\u2013Ing. degree in electrical engineering and the Dr.\u2013Ing. degree from RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany, in 2007 and 2013, respectively.

In the LTE radio system, e.g., the code rate adaptation is carried out based on a fixed-rate mother Turbo code by means of bit puncturing and bit repetition. However, lower code rates can alternatively be provided by \\gls{IC} Turbo codes. In RCIC Turbo codes, known bits (dummy bits) are inserted into the information bit sequence during Turbo encoding, providing perfect \\apri knowledge to the mother decoder. In this contribution, a detailed analysis of RCIC Turbo codes is provided. It will be shown that these codes outperform rate-compatible Turbo codes using bit repetition in terms of frame error rate and convergence speed. Furthermore, their EXIT charts will be derived from the EXIT chart of the mother Turbo code. This EXIT chart analysis enables a novel semi-analytical optimization tool for RCIC Turbo codes and the efficient EXIT chart comparison of competing codes, avoiding complex simulations.

Single antenna MDs are randomly distributed on a 2D plane according to a Poisson point process, and only a subset of them are sources leaving other idle MDs available to assist them (relays). Our goal is to develop an efficient algorithm to cluster each source with a subset of available relays to form a VMIMO system under a limited feedback assumption. We first show that the NP-hard optimization problem of precoding in our scenario can be approximately solved by semidefinite relaxation. We investigate a special case with a single source and analytically derive an upper bound on the average spectral efficiency of the VMIMO system. Then, we propose an optimal greedy algorithm that achieves this bound. We further exploit these results to obtain a polynomial time clustering algorithm for the general case with multiple sources. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to compare the performance of our algorithm with that of an exhaustive clustering algorithm, and it shown that these numerical results corroborate the efficiency of our algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.012114.120283","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6776574/06725586.pdf","startPage":"1334","endPage":"1343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.012114.120283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776574","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Clustering Algorithm for Device-to-Device Assisted Virtual MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725586","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725586/","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Clustering Algorithm for Device-to-Device Assisted Virtual MIMO","volume":"13","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14181483","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6725586/","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Clustering Algorithm for Device-to-Device Assisted Virtual MIMO","sourcePdf":"1334-tw1403-seyed.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084097S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6776574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6776574","articleId":"6725586","onlineDate":"27 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6725588,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Arkansas, Fayeteville, AR, U.S.A"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6776574/6725588/6725588-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ning Sun received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China, in 2005 and 2008, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, USA, in 2013.

The fast time-varying fading in high mobility systems can be tracked with pilot-assisted channel estimation. The percentage of pilot symbols in the transmitted symbols plays a critical role on the system performance: a higher pilot percentage yields a more accurate channel estimation, but also more overhead. The effects of pilot percentage are quantified through the derivation of the channel estimation mean squared error (MSE), which is expressed as a closed-form expression of various system parameters through asymptotic analysis. It is discovered that, if the pilots sample the channel above its Nyquist rate, then the estimation of the channel coefficients of data symbols through temporal interpolation yields the same asymptotic MSE as the direct estimation of the channel coefficients of the pilot symbols. Based on the statistical properties of the channel estimation error, we quantify the impacts of the imperfect CSI on the system performance by developing the analytical symbol error rate (SER) and a spectral efficiency lower bound of the communication system. The optimum pilot percentage that can maximize the spectral efficiency lower bound is identified through both analytical and simulation results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6776574/06725588.pdf","startPage":"1462","endPage":"1470","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.012314.130772","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.012314.130772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776574","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximizing Spectral Efficiency for High Mobility Systems with Imperfect Channel State Information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Fading","Interpolation","Estimation","Vectors","Signal to noise ratio","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","fading channels","interpolation","mean square error methods","mobility management (mobile radio)","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectral efficiency maximization","high mobility wireless communication system","imperfect channel state information","CSI","time-varying fading","mean squared error channel estimation","closed-form expression","Nyquist rate","channel coefficient","MSE","temporal interpolation yield","statistical properties","symbol error rate","SER","spectral efficiency lower bound"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High mobility communications","imperfect channel state information","channel estimation error","spectral efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725588/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Maximizing Spectral Efficiency for High Mobility Systems with Imperfect Channel State Information","volume":"13","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6725588/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14181488","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximizing Spectral Efficiency for High Mobility Systems with Imperfect Channel State Information","sourcePdf":"1462-tw1403-ning.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075411S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6776574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6776574","articleId":"6725588","onlineDate":"27 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6725592,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6748342/6725592/6725592-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hui Li received the B.

Specifically, we evaluate the performance of the energy efficiency in two different cases: 1) the circuit power consumption is comparable to or even dominates the transmit power, and 2) the circuit power can be ignored due to relatively much higher transmit power. The theoretical analysis indicates that there exists an optimal number of selected antennas to maximize the energy efficiency in the first case, whereas in the second case, the energy efficiency is maximized when all the available antennas are used. Based on these conclusions, two simple but efficient antenna selection algorithms are proposed to obtain the maximum energy efficiency.

The interference constraints are difficult to satisfy when the channel state information (CSI) is imperfect. In this paper, we propose a robust beamforming scheme for the multi-antenna non-regenerative cognitive relay network where the multi-antenna relay with imperfect CSIs helps the communication of single-antenna SU. Our objective is to design a robust beamforming scheme which maximizes the system capacity subject to transmit power constraint and interference constraints. The bounded channel uncertainties are modeled using the worst-case model. The robust beamforming problem, neglecting the correlation of channel uncertainties, is reformulated as a convex semidefinite programming (SDP) by rank-one relaxation. This convex SDP is related with the worst-case relay transmit power minimization problem, which is further reformulated as a convex SDP, whose rank-one solution is proved to exist. Thus, we propose the suboptimal solution to the robust beamforming problem which is found effectively by solving two convex SDPs. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725593/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","volume":"62","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"14128280","publicationDate":"February 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6725593/","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2014","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust Beamforming for Cognitive Multi-Antenna Relay Networks with Bounded Channel Uncertainties","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Beamforming for Cognitive Multi-Antenna Relay Networks with Bounded Channel Uncertainties","sourcePdf":"478-tc1402-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097551S","chronDate":"February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6748342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6748342","articleId":"6725593","onlineDate":"27 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6725595,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangbin Yu","affiliation":["City University of Hong Kong, Southeast University"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6776574/6725595/6725595-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiangbin Yu received his Ph.D. in Communication and Information Systems in 2004 from National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory at Southeast University, China.

The unified analysis is applicable to MIMO transceiving systems whose received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is given as largest order statistic of chi-square distribution. The performance of MUS-MIMO employing selective transmission/selective combining (ST/SC), ST/maximum ratio combining (MRC) and space-time block codes (STBC) can be analyzed by this general framework. Accurate and approximate unified closed-form BER and outage probability expressions of the MUS-MIMO transceiving system with normalized SNR-based scheduling in heterogeneous networks are derived. Based on the approximate BER and outage probability expressions, diversity gains are analyzed at high SNR. The results indicate that the MUS-MIMO for using the three transceiving schemes can achieve full diversity order for perfect CSI, while the diversity gain is degraded differently for the three transceiving schemes under imperfect CSI. Computer simulation shows that the theoretical analysis is in good agreement with simulation results, and the approximate BER expressions are very close to the accurate ones but with lower computational complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unified Analysis of Multiuser Scheduling for Downlink MIMO Systems with Imperfect CSI","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.012314.130466","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6776574/06725595.pdf","startPage":"1344","endPage":"1355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.012314.130466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776574","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725595","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725595/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","displayDocTitle":"Unified Analysis of Multiuser Scheduling for Downlink MIMO Systems with Imperfect CSI","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6725595/","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14181482","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unified Analysis of Multiuser Scheduling for Downlink MIMO Systems with Imperfect CSI","sourcePdf":"1344-tw1403-yu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108035S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6776574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6776574","articleId":"6725595","onlineDate":"27 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6725596,"authors":[{"name":"Imtiaz Ahmed","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6776574/6725596/6725596-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Imtiaz Ahmed (S'09) received his B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical and electronic engineering (EEE) from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 2006 and 2008, respectively.

In conventional relaying, source and relay transmit signals in consecutive time slots whereas in buffer-aided link adaptive relaying, the state of the source-relay and relay-destination channels {as well as the amounts of energy available at source and relay} determine whether the source or the relay is selected for transmission. Our objective is to maximize the system throughput over a finite number of transmission time slots for both relaying protocols. In case of conventional relaying, we propose an offline and several online joint source and relay transmit power allocation schemes. For offline power allocation, we formulate {a convex optimization problem} whereas for the online case, we propose a dynamic programming (DP) approach to compute the optimal online transmit power. To alleviate the complexity inherent to DP, we also propose several suboptimal online power allocation schemes. For buffer-aided link adaptive relaying, we show that the joint offline optimization of the source and relay transmit powers along with the link selection results in a mixed integer non-linear program which we solve optimally using the spatial branch-and-bound method. We also propose efficient online power allocation schemes for buffer-aided link adaptive relaying. Simulation results show that buffer-aided link adaptive relaying provides significant performance gains compared to conventional relaying but requires a higher complexity for computation of the power allocation solution. We also show that buffer-aided link adaptive relaying is more robust to changes in the EH rate than conventional relaying.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.012314.121185","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6776574/06725596.pdf","startPage":"1182","endPage":"1195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.012314.121185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776574","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Allocation for Conventional and Buffer-Aided Link Adaptive Relaying Systems with Energy Harvesting Nodes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725596/","displayDocTitle":"Power Allocation for Conventional and Buffer-Aided Link Adaptive Relaying Systems with Energy Harvesting Nodes","volume":"13","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14181455","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6725596/","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Allocation for Conventional and Buffer-Aided Link Adaptive Relaying Systems with Energy Harvesting Nodes","sourcePdf":"1182-tw1403-imtiaz.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108947S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6776574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"6776574","articleId":"6725596","onlineDate":"27 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6725601,"authors":[{"name":"S.

One method to optically generate single and multicarriers is to use the microring resonator (MRR). The MRRs can be used as filter devices, where generation of high-frequency (GHz) soliton signals as single and multicarriers can be performed using suitable system parameters. Here, the optical soliton in a nonlinear fiber MRR system is analyzed, using a modified add/drop system known as a Panda ring resonator connected to an add/drop system. In order to set up a transmission system, i.e., IEEE802.11a, first, 64 uniform optical carriers were generated and separated by a splitter and modulated; afterward, the spectra of the modulated optical subcarriers are overlapped, which results one optical OFDM channel band. The quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and 16-QAM are used for modulating the subcarriers. The generated OFDM signal is multiplexed with a single-carrier soliton and transmitted through the single-mode fiber (SMF). After photodetection, the radio frequency (RF) signal was propagated. On the receiver side, the RF signal was optically modulated and processed. The results show the generation of 64 multicarriers evenly spaced in the range from 54.09 to 55.01 GHz, where demodulation of these signals is performed, and the performance of the system is analyzed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/6689334/06725601.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2302791","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2302791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6689334","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"All-Optical OFDM Generation for IEEE802.11a Based on Soliton Carriers Using Microring Resonators","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical ring resonators","OFDM","Optical solitons","Nonlinear optics","Optical filters","Optical fibers","Optical transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["micromechanical resonators","OFDM modulation","optical communication","optical modulation","optical solitons","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Panda ring resonator","multicarriers","optical carrier generation","microring resonators","soliton carriers","IEEE802.11a","all-optical OFDM generation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Panda ring resonator","soliton carriers","IEEE802.11a","OFDM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725601/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"All-Optical OFDM Generation for IEEE802.11a Based on Soliton Carriers Using Microring Resonators","volume":"6","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6725601/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14066420","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","externalId":"7900109","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"All-Optical OFDM Generation for IEEE802.11a Based on Soliton Carriers Using Microring Resonators","sourcePdf":"jphot-amiri-2302791-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088803S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"6689334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6689334","articleId":"6725601","onlineDate":"27 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6725602,"authors":[{"name":"Mingbo Niu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Mingbo","lastName":"Niu","id":"37409272100"},{"name":"Julian Cheng","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of British Columbia, Kelowna, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Julian","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37277386100"},{"name":"Jonathan F.

Our method begins with initializing the seed positions and runs the LRW algorithm on the input image to obtain the probabilities of each pixel. Then, the boundaries of initial superpixels are obtained according to the probabilities and the commute time. The initial superpixels are iteratively optimized by the new energy function, which is defined on the commute time and the texture measurement. Our LRW algorithm with self-loops has the merits of segmenting the weak boundaries and complicated texture regions very well by the new global probability maps and the commute time strategy. The performance of superpixel is improved by relocating the center positions of superpixels and dividing the large superpixels into small ones with the proposed optimization algorithm. The experimental results have demonstrated that our method achieves better performance than previous superpixel approaches.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/6742656/06725608.pdf","startPage":"1451","endPage":"1462","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2014.2302892","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2014.2302892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742656","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725608","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lazy Random Walks for Superpixel Segmentation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Optimization","Symmetric matrices","Image edge detection","Computed tomography","Laplace equations","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","image texture","iterative methods","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lazy random walks","image superpixel segmentation","LRW algorithm","seed positions","iterative optimisation","texture measurement","texture regions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lazy random walk","commute time","optimization","superpixel","texture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725608/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Lazy Random Walks for Superpixel Segmentation","volume":"23","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6725608/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14112164","pubMedId":"24565788","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lazy Random Walks for Superpixel Segmentation","sourcePdf":"tip-jianbing-2302892-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090774S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6742656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"236","xplore-issue":"6742656","articleId":"6725608","onlineDate":"27 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-04"},{"_id":6725609,"authors":[{"name":"Xin-Kuan Wang","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Antenna and Microwave Laboratory, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6782669/6725609/6725609-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xin-Kuan Wang received the B.S. degree in Science from Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China, in 2004, and the M.S. degree in radio science and the Ph.D. degree in electromagnetics and microwave technology from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 2009 and 2013, respectively.","Currently, he is teaching at the School of Physics and Telecommunication Engineering, Shaanxi University of Technology, Hanzhong, China.

environmental monitoring and management have received much attention recently, and an integrated information system (IIS) is considered highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel IIS that combines Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Geoinformatics [remote sensing (RS), geographical information system (GIS), and global positioning system (GPS)], and e-Science for environmental monitoring and management, with a case study on regional climate change and its ecological effects. Multi-sensors and web services were used to collect data and other information for the perception layer; both public networks and private networks were used to access and transport mass data and other information in the network layer. The key technologies and tools include real-time operational database (RODB); extraction\u2013transformation\u2013loading (ETL); on-line analytical processing (OLAP) and relational OLAP (ROLAP); naming, addressing, and profile server (NAPS); application gateway (AG); application software for different platforms and tasks (APPs); IoT application infrastructure (IoT-AI); GIS and e-Science platforms; and representational state transfer/Java database connectivity (RESTful/JDBC). Application Program Interfaces (APIs) were implemented in the middleware layer of the IIS. The application layer provides the functions of storing, organizing, processing, and sharing of data and other information, as well as the functions of applications in environmental monitoring and management. The results from the case study show that there is a visible increasing trend of the air temperature in Xinjiang over the last 50\u00a0years (1962\u20132011) and an apparent increasing trend of the precipitation since the early 1980s. Furthermore, from the correlation between ecological indicators [gross primary production (GPP), net primary production (NPP), and leaf area index (LAI)] and meteorological elements (air temperature and precipitation), water resource availability is the decisive factor with regard to the terrestrial ecosystem in the area. The study shows that the research work is greatly benefited from such an IIS, not only in data collection supported by IoT, but also in Web services and applications based on cloud computing and e-Science platforms, and the effectiveness of monitoring processes and decision-making can be obviously improved. This paper provides a prototype IIS for environmental monitoring and management, and it also provides a new paradigm for the future research and practice; especially in the era of big data and IoT.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725615/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2014","accessionNumber":"14267640","publicationDate":"May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6725615/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Integrated System for Regional Environmental Monitoring and Management Based on Internet of Things","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Integrated System for Regional Environmental Monitoring and Management Based on Internet of Things","sourcePdf":"tii-fang-2302638-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091405S","chronDate":"May  2014","isNumber":"6809862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"279","articleId":"6725615","onlineDate":"27 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":6725634,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaochuan He","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6812145/6725634/he-2299524-small.gif","p":["Xiaochuan He received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in biomedical engineering from Shandong University, Jinan, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively.

Most of the blood measurement devices in the market determine the ABP through the inflation and the deflation of a cuff controlled by a bladder. This method is very uncomfortable for most of the users and may even cause anxiety, which in turn can affect the blood pressure (BP) (white coat syndrome). This paper investigates a cuffless nonintrusive approach to estimate the BP. The main idea is to measure the pulse transit time (PTT), i.e., the delay between the R-peak of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and the following peak of the finger photoplethysmograph (PPG) signal. The main problem of this approach is that when the dicrotic notch of the PPG signal is unobservable, the position and the amplitude of the main peak of the PPG signal will be changed. As a result, the correlation between the BP and the PTT can be affected. To overcome this problem, three types of secondary peak detection methods are designed to reveal the secondary peak from the original PPG signal. Actual ECG, PPG, and the BP measurements extracted from the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II database that contains clinical signal data reflecting real measurements are used. The results verify that the proposed detection methods improve the correlation relationship between the BP and the PTT, and demonstrate that the adjusted PTT can be used as an indicator of the ABP by removing the dicrotic notch impact on the PPG signal.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2014.2299524","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/6812145/06725634.pdf","startPage":"1431","endPage":"1439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6812145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2014.2299524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secondary Peak Detection of PPG Signal for Continuous Cuffless Arterial Blood Pressure Measurement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","displayDocTitle":"Secondary Peak Detection of PPG Signal for Continuous Cuffless Arterial Blood Pressure Measurement","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725634/","publicationDate":"June 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14284128","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6725634/","volume":"63","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"},{"fundingName":"Industrial and Government Partners through the Healthcare support through Information Technology Enhancements Strategic Research Network"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secondary Peak Detection of PPG Signal for Continuous Cuffless Arterial Blood Pressure Measurement","sourcePdf":"tim-he-2299524-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093221S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6812145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6812145","articleId":"6725634","onlineDate":"27 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6725637,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Gong","affiliation":["Advanced Micro and Nanosystems Laboratory, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Gong","id":"37076962300"},{"name":"Brandon K.

To minimize electron-induced damage and improve measurement accuracy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging parameters must be cautiously chosen to ensure low electron energy and dosage. This results in significant image noise and drift. This paper presents automated nanoprobing with a nanomanipulation system inside a standard SEM. We achieved SEM image denoising and drift compensation in real time. This capability is necessary for achieving robust visual tracking and servo control of nanomanipulators for probing nanostructures in automated operation. This capability also proves highly useful to conventional manual operation by rendering real-time SEM images that have little noise and drift. The automated system probed nanostructures on an SEM metrology chip as surrogates of electronic features on IC chips. Success rates in visual tracking and Z-contact detection under various imaging conditions were quantitatively discussed. The experimental results demonstrate the system's capability for automated probing of nanostructures under IC-chip-probing relevant electron microscope imaging conditions.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2014.2298551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6824878","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8860/6824878/06725637.pdf","endPage":"765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robotic Probing of Nanostructures inside Scanning Electron Microscopy","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2014.2298551","startPage":"758","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725637","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Robotic Probing of Nanostructures inside Scanning Electron Microscopy","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725637/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"14349479","publicationDate":"June 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6725637/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"30","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robotic Probing of Nanostructures inside Scanning Electron Microscopy","sourcePdf":"tro-sun-2298551-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093208S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"6824878","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6824878","articleId":"6725637","onlineDate":"27 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6725638,"authors":[{"name":"Didem G\u00f6z\u00fcpek","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Gebze Institute of Technology, Kocaeli, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/7041254/6725638/6725638-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Didem G\u00f6z\u00fcpek received the B.S. degree (high honors) in telecommunications engineering from Sabanc\u0131 University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2004, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), Newark, NJ, USA, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2012.","She is an Assistant Professor with the Computer Engineering Department, Gebze Institute of Technology, Kocaeli, Turkey.

Such systems typically involve collections of battery-operated wireless sensors that sample vibration data over time. After the data is transmitted to a central node, modal analysis can be used to detect damage in the structure. In this paper, we propose and study three frameworks for Compressive Sensing (CS) in SHM systems; these methods are intended to minimize power consumption by allowing the data to be sampled and/or transmitted more efficiently. At the central node, all of these frameworks involve a very simple technique for estimating the structure's mode shapes without requiring a traditional CS reconstruction of the vibration signals; all that is needed is to compute a simple Singular Value Decomposition. We provide theoretical justification (including measurement bounds) for each of these techniques based on the equations of motion describing a simplified Multiple-Degree-Of-Freedom (MDOF) system, and we support our proposed techniques using simulations based on synthetic and real data.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2302736","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6757015/06725639.pdf","startPage":"1655","endPage":"1670","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2302736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757015","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modal Analysis With Compressive Measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April1,  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725639/","displayDocTitle":"Modal Analysis With Compressive Measurements","volume":"62","issue":"7","publicationDate":"April1, 2014","accessionNumber":"14144650","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6725639/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modal Analysis With Compressive Measurements","sourcePdf":"tsp-wakin-2302736-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086035S","chronDate":"April1,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6757015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6757015","articleId":"6725639","onlineDate":"27 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6725645,"authors":[{"name":"David Jacquet","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Grenoble, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6777594/6725645/6725645-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["David Jacquet received a degree in microelectronics engineering from ENSERG-ENSIMAG in Grenoble, France.","He is a Senior Principal Engineer at STMicroelectronics.

The implementation is based on a fully synthesizable standard design flow. The design exploits the important flexibility provided by the FD-SOI technology, notably a wide Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) range, from 0.52 V to 1.37 V, and Forward Body Bias (FBB) techniques up to 1.3 V. Detailed explanations of the body-biasing techniques specific to this technology are largely presented, in the context of a multi- VT co-integration, which enable this energy efficient silicon implementation. The system integrates all the advanced IPs for energy efficiency as well as the body bias generator and a fast (\u03bcs range) dynamic body bias management capability. The measured dual core CPU maximum operation frequency is 3 GHz (for 1.37 V) and it can be operated down to 300 MHz (for 0.52 V) in full continuous DVFS. The obtained relative performance, with respect to an equivalent planar 28 nm bulk CMOS chip, shows an improvement of +237% at 0.6 V, or +544% at 0.61 V with 1.3 V FBB.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2013.2295977","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/6777594/06725645.pdf","startPage":"812","endPage":"826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777594","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2013.2295977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 3 GHz Dual Core Processor ARM Cortex TM -A9 in 28 nm UTBB FD-SOI CMOS With Ultra-Wide Voltage Range and Energy Efficiency Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725645","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"A 3 GHz Dual Core Processor ARM Cortex TM -A9 in 28 nm UTBB FD-SOI CMOS With Ultra-Wide Voltage Range and Energy Efficiency Optimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725645/","publicationDate":"April 2014","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14196359","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6725645/","volume":"49","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 3 GHz Dual Core Processor ARM Cortex TM -A9 in 28 nm UTBB FD-SOI CMOS With Ultra-Wide Voltage Range and Energy Efficiency Optimization","sourcePdf":"jssc-jacquet-2295977-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156812S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6777594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"6777594","articleId":"6725645","onlineDate":"27 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6725651,"authors":[{"name":"Avi Motil","affiliation":["Tel Aviv University, School of Electrical Engineering, Ramat Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Avi","lastName":"Motil","id":"37061639900"},{"name":"Orr Danon","affiliation":["Tel Aviv University, School of Electrical Engineering, Ramat Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Orr","lastName":"Danon","id":"37085452706"},{"name":"Yair Peled","affiliation":["Tel Aviv University, School of Electrical Engineering, Ramat Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Yair","lastName":"Peled","id":"38196268200"},{"name":"Moshe Tur","affiliation":["Tel Aviv University, School of Electrical Engineering, Ramat Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Moshe","lastName":"Tur","id":"37276678400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"6725651","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":587},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scattering","Strain","Optical fiber sensors","Probes","Optical fiber polarization","Strain measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical fiber sensors","nonlinear optics","Brillouin scattering"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725651","abstract":"A small modification of the fast and distributed slope-assisted Brillouin time domain analysis (SA-BOTDA) method allows it to easily implement pump-power independent measurements of strain and/or temperature, using the ratio between readings taken on both slopes of the Brillouin gain spectrum.

A multipath point spread function (PSF) is defined that allows for specular reflections in the local environment and can allow the ghost images to be localized. Analysis of the multipath PSF shows that certain ghosts can only be focused for the far field synthetic aperture radar case and not the full array case. Importantly, the ghosts are shown to be equivalent to direct target images taken from different observation angles. This equivalence suggests that exploiting the ghosts would improve target classification performance, and this improvement is demonstrated using experimental data and a na\u00efve Bayesian classifer.

The quality assessment of 3D images faces more new challenges, such as asymmetric stereo compression, depth perception, and virtual view synthesis, than its 2D counterparts. In addition, the widely used 2D image quality metrics (e.g., PSNR and SSIM) cannot be directly applied to deal with these newly introduced challenges. This statement can be verified by the low correlation between the computed objective measures and the subjectively measured mean opinion scores (MOSs), when 3D images are the tested targets. In order to meet these newly introduced challenges, in this paper, besides traditional 2D image metrics, the binocular integration behaviors-the binocular combination and the binocular frequency integration, are utilized as the bases for measuring the quality of stereoscopic 3D images. The effectiveness of the proposed metrics is verified by conducting subjective evaluations on publicly available stereoscopic image databases. Experimental results show that significant consistency could be reached between the measured MOS and the proposed metrics, in which the correlation coefficient between them can go up to 0.88. Furthermore, we found that the proposed metrics can also address the quality assessment of the synthesized color-plus-depth 3D images well. Therefore, it is our belief that the binocular integration behaviors are important factors in the development of objective quality assessment for 3D images.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

Compared to direct torque control, MPTC is more effective and accurate in voltage vector selection by incorporating the system model directly with the finite switching states. However, for two-level inverter-fed IM drives, the sampling frequency of MPTC has to be high to achieve good performance due to the limited number of voltage vectors. Recently, the concept of duty cycle control was introduced in MPTC by inserting a null vector along with the selected active voltage vector to achieve torque ripple reduction. The active vector is first selected from conventional MPTC and then its duration is determined based on a certain principle. The cascaded processing of active vector and its duration leads to poor low-speed performance and the sampling frequency still has to be high. This paper proposes an improved MPTC with duty cycle control by optimizing the vector selection and its duration simultaneously when minimizing both torque and flux errors. As a result, better steady-state performance at both low and high speeds is achieved, even if the sampling frequency is reduced by half. The effectiveness of the proposed MPTC is verified by both simulation and experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2014.2302838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6877756","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2014.2302838","endPage":"6603","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6877756/06725678.pdf","startPage":"6593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Predictive Torque Control of Induction Motor Drives With Optimal Duty Cycle Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725678/","displayDocTitle":"Model Predictive Torque Control of Induction Motor Drives With Optimal Duty Cycle Control","volume":"29","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"14514045","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6725678/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51207003 and 51347004"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005090","fundingName":"Beijing Nova Program","grantNumber":"xx2013001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Predictive Torque Control of Induction Motor Drives With Optimal Duty Cycle Control","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhang-2302838-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084744S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6877756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"229","xplore-issue":"6877756","articleId":"6725678","onlineDate":"27 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6725679,"authors":[{"name":"Mun-Soo Park","affiliation":["Korea Institute of Aerospace Technology, Daejeon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/6915776/6725679/6725679-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mun-Soo Park received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electronics engineering from Ajou University, Suwon, Korea, in 1995, 1997, and 2007, respectively.","From 2007 to 2009, he was a Postdoctoral Research Associate with Ajou University.

Since the sway dynamics are disturbed by the trolley acceleration and hoisting velocity, antisway control law is designed based on the sliding mode control by defining a sliding surface in such a way that the trolley acceleration contributes to the sway dynamics as nonlinear damping in sliding mode. In addition, this nonlinear damping is designed such that it dominates the inherent damping coupled with the hoisting velocity so that the asymptotic stability of the sway dynamics can be achieved. To cope with system uncertainties such as system parameter variations, unknown actuator nonlinearities, unmodeled dynamics, and external disturbances, we design a fuzzy uncertainty observer and incorporate it into the sliding-mode antisway control law. Via the stability analysis and computer simulations, we show that the proposed control law guarantees the robust antisway performance of overhead cranes, regardless of hoisting velocity, even in the presence of system uncertainties.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2013.2290139","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/6915776/06725679.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6915776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2013.2290139","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","startPage":"1262","endPage":"1271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Sliding-Mode Antisway Control of Uncertain Overhead Cranes With High-Speed Hoisting Motion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725679","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Sliding-Mode Antisway Control of Uncertain Overhead Cranes With High-Speed Hoisting Motion","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725679/","volume":"22","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6725679/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14648383","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"2012R1A1A2006233"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Sliding-Mode Antisway Control of Uncertain Overhead Cranes With High-Speed Hoisting Motion","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-chwa-2290139-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098206S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"6915776","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"6915776","articleId":"6725679","onlineDate":"27 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6725681,"authors":[{"name":"Mauricio Cespedes","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Mauricio","lastName":"Cespedes","id":"37391830200"},{"name":"Jian Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Sun","id":"37281412000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1949-3029"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1949-3037"}],"articleNumber":"6725681","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":157,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":3209},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Impedance","Phase locked loops","Bandwidth","Power system stability","Stability analysis","Inductance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-DC power convertors","adaptive control","electric impedance measurement","invertors","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grid connected inverters","online grid impedance measurements","inverter impedance","gain scheduling adaptive control system","impulse response analysis method","Routh Hurwitz stability analysis","system stability","impedance identification","three phase inverter","variable feeder impedance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ac\u2013dc power converters","adaptive systems"]}],"abstract":"Stability of a grid-connected inverter depends on the ratio of the grid impedance to the inverter impedance. Since the grid impedance changes during normal power system conditions, this paper proposes a gain-scheduling adaptive control system that uses online grid impedance measurements. For grid impedance measurement, an impulse-response analysis method is programmed in the digital-signal processor (DSP) of the grid-connected inverter. For adaptation, a Routh-Hurwitz stability analysis approach is used to derive, analytically, the stable operation boundaries of the interconnected system. To simplify the analytical derivations, the grid impedance is assumed inductive at low frequencies and curve fitted to the online impedance measurements. Experimental measurements demonstrate the improvement in system stability, when the impedance identification and adaptive control algorithms are programmed together in the DSP of a three-phase inverter, which is connected to a grid with a variable feeder impedance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Control of Grid-Connected Inverters Based on Online Grid Impedance Measurements","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","doi":"10.1109/TSTE.2013.2295201","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165391/6774903/06725681.pdf","startPage":"516","endPage":"523","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSTE.2013.2295201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6774903","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725681","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725681/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Control of Grid-Connected Inverters Based on Online Grid Impedance Measurements","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2014","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14180648","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Control of Grid-Connected Inverters Based on Online Grid Impedance Measurements","sourcePdf":"tste-cespedes-2295201-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03347S","chronDate":"April  2014","isNumber":"6774903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"157","articleId":"6725681","onlineDate":"27 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6725683,"authors":[{"name":"Oladayo Bello","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Monash South Africa, Ruimsig, South Africa"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/7551252/6725683/bello-2298837-small.gif","p":["\nOladayo Bello (M'05) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering \nfrom the University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.","She is currently a Senior Lecturer with the School of Information Technology, Monash University, South Africa \nCampus, Johannesburg, South Africa.

Therefore, device-to-device (D2D) communication is expected to be an intrinsic part of the IoT. Devices will communicate with each other autonomously without any centralized control and collaborate to gather, share, and forward information in a multihop manner. The ability to gather relevant information in real time is key to leveraging the value of the IoT as such information will be transformed into intelligence, which will facilitate the creation of an intelligent environment. Ultimately, the quality of the information gathered depends on how smart the devices are. In addition, these communicating devices will operate with different networking standards, may experience intermittent connectivity with each other, and many of them will be resource constrained. These characteristics open up several networking challenges that traditional routing protocols cannot solve. Consequently, devices will require intelligent routing protocols in order to achieve intelligent D2D communication. We present an overview of how intelligent D2D communication can be achieved in the IoT ecosystem. In particular, we focus on how state-of-the-art routing algorithms can achieve intelligent D2D communication in the IoT.","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2014.2298837","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2014.2298837","startPage":"1172","endPage":"1182","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/7551252/06725683.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7551252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent Device-to-Device Communication in the Internet of Things","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725683/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent Device-to-Device Communication in the Internet of Things","volume":"10","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2016","accessionNumber":"16250611","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/6725683/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent Device-to-Device Communication in the Internet of Things","sourcePdf":"jsyst-zeadally-2298837-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075551S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"7551252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"252","xplore-issue":"7551252","articleId":"6725683","onlineDate":"27 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6725688,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Senning","affiliation":["EPFL Lausanne, telecommunication circuit laboratory (TCL), Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6820808/6725688/6725688-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christian Senning (S'08) was born in Zurich, Switzerland, in 1981.

With this model, a 2-D cylindrical coordinate domain FDTD simulation was carried out to study cylindrically shaped conductive backfill material (SCBM) performance with fine grids. From experimental results, some optimal programs have been derived for SCBM in grounding systems. It is found that a large metal rod size can reduce the SCBM resistance only when the main body conductivity is low, and the reduction effect declines as the conductivity increases. Second, the SCBM resistance is as low as the resistance of a conductor of the same size when the main body conductivity reaches 0.5 S/m. Third, enlarging the SCBM radius can reduce the grounding resistance, and resistance can also be reduced by enlarging the SCBM length when it is less than its effective length.

In this work, the desired property is fault tolerance, defined as the post-failure Jacobian possessing the largest possible minimum singular value over all possible locked-joint failures. A mathematical analysis based on the Gram matrix that describes the number of possible planar robot designs for optimally fault-tolerant Jacobians is presented. It is shown that rearranging the columns of the Jacobian or multiplying one or more of the columns of the Jacobian by \u00b11 will not affect local fault tolerance; however, this will typically result in a very different manipulator. Two examples, one that is optimal to a single joint failure and the second that is optimal to two joint failures, are analyzed. This analysis shows that there is a large variability in the global kinematic properties of these designs, despite being generated from the same Jacobian. It is especially surprising that major differences in global behavior occurs for manipulators that are identical in the working area.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725694/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","publicationDate":"April 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6725694/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"14210117","volume":"30","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Kinematic Analysis and Evaluation of Planar Robots Designed From Optimally Fault-Tolerant Jacobians","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Kinematic Analysis and Evaluation of Planar Robots Designed From Optimally Fault-Tolerant Jacobians","sourcePdf":"tro-bengharbia-2291615-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128317S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"6781558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6781558","articleId":"6725694","onlineDate":"27 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6725819,"authors":[{"name":"Thavamaran Kanesan","affiliation":["Optical Communications Research Group, Northumbria University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK"],"firstName":"Thavamaran","lastName":"Kanesan","id":"37947582400"},{"name":"Wai Pang Ng","affiliation":["Optical Communications Research Group, Northumbria University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK"],"firstName":"Wai Pang","lastName":"Ng","id":"37396075900"},{"name":"Zabih Ghassemlooy","affiliation":["Optical Communications Research Group, Northumbria University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK"],"firstName":"Zabih","lastName":"Ghassemlooy","id":"37267374400"},{"name":"Chao Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Lu","id":"37280494400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-0620"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0639"}],"articleNumber":"6725819","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":857},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Optical fibers","Optical distortion","Adaptive optics","Radio frequency","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude modulation","frequency division multiplexing","Long Term Evolution","quadrature amplitude modulation","quadrature phase shift keying","radiofrequency interference","radio-over-fibre","Rayleigh scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["experimental full duplex simultaneous transmission","DWDM directly modulated RoF system","full duplex system frequency division duplex","FDD","long term evolution","LTE technology","radio over fiber","RoF","eNodeB","eNB","quadrature phase-shift keying","QPSK","quadrature amplitude modulation","QAM","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","single carrier frequency division multiplexing","UL transmissions","dense wavelength division multiplexing","DWDM","Rayleigh backscattering","nonlinear interference mitigation","broad frequency spacing","BFS","intermediate frequency spacing","IFS","narrow frequency spacing","NFS","adjacent channel leakage ratio","ACLR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency division duplex","Full duplex","Long term evolution","OFDM","Radio-over-fiber","Relay node"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate the seamless integration of full duplex system frequency division duplex (FDD) long-term evolution (LTE) technology with radio over fiber (RoF) for eNodeB (eNB) coverage extension.

The RoF system is composed of dedicated directly modulated lasers for DL and UL with dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) for instantaneous connections and for Rayleigh backscattering and nonlinear interference mitigation. DL and UL signals have varying carrier frequencies and are categorized as broad frequency spacing (BFS), intermediate frequency spacing (IFS), and narrow frequency spacing (NFS). The adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) for DL and UL with 64-QAM are similar for all frequency spacings while cross talk is observed for NFS.

Our approach relies on incorporating a client-weighted algorithm (CWA) in the optical capacity allocation mechanism employed in the MT-MAC scheme, so as to distribute the available wavelengths to the different antenna units according to the total number of active users served by each individual antenna. The protocol's throughput and delay fairness characteristics are evaluated and validated through both simulations and analytic modeling for saturated network traffic operational conditions. In addition, extended simulation-based performance analysis for nonsaturated network conditions and for different end-user distributions, traffic loads, and available optical wavelengths at 1 Gbps data rates is presented. Our results confirm that complete throughput equalization can be achieved even for highly varying user population patterns when certain wavelength availability conditions are satisfied. At the same time, the presented scheme manages to equalize the average packet delays amongst packets generated by all RAUs while concurrently dropping the packet delay variation metric that is essential for quality of service delivery. Finally the proposed RAU design reduces insertion losses by almost 14 dB compared to RAU elements used in MT-MAC-compatible bus networks, extending in this way the number of supported RAUs by an order of magnitude and enabling the formation of extended-reach, high-speed RoF WLANs.","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.6.000033","publicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563700/6725814/06725822.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.6.000033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6725814","startPage":"33","endPage":"44","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Client-weighted medium-transparent MAC protocol for user-centric fairness in 60 GHz radio-over-fiber WLANs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725822","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Client-weighted medium-transparent MAC protocol for user-centric fairness in 60 GHz radio-over-fiber WLANs","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725822/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14057280","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6725822/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Client-weighted medium-transparent MAC protocol for user-centric fairness in 60 GHz radio-over-fiber WLANs","sourcePdf":"33.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099267S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4563700","isNumber":"6725814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6725814","articleId":"6725822","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":6725823,"authors":[{"name":"Friederike Brendel","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Hochfrequenztechnik und Elektronik (IHE), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Karlsruhe, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Friederike Brendel received a Dipl.-Ing.

Survivability is a crucial issue in OFDM-based flexible optical networks. Recently we proposed a new survivable multi-path provisioning scheme (MPP) that efficiently supports demands with flexible protection requirement in OFDM-based optical networks and studied the static survivable multipath routing and spectrum allocation (SM-RSA) problem, which aims to accommodate a given set of demands with minimum utilized spectrum. We have showed that the MPP scheme achieves higher spectral efficiency than the traditional single-path provisioning (SPP) scheme. In this paper, we study the dynamic SM-RSA problem, which selects multiple routes and allocates spectrum on these routes for a given demand as it arrives at the network. We develop an integer linear programming (ILP) model as well as a heuristic algorithm for the dynamic SM-RSA problem. We conduct simulations to study the advantage of MPP over SPP for the dynamic traffic scenario in terms of blocking performance and fairness. We also compare the performance of the MPP heuristic algorithm and the ILP model.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563700/6725814/06725826.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"85","publicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.6.000077","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.6.000077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6725814","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic survivable multipath routing and spectrum allocation in OFDM-based flexible optical networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Routing","Optical fiber networks","Bandwidth","Resource management","Equations","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","integer programming","linear programming","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","optical communication","optical modulation","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication traffic","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic survivable multipath routing","spectrum allocation problem","OFDM-based flexible optical networks","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","spectral efficiency","flexible bandwidth allocation capability","fine granularity","survivable multipath provisioning scheme","MPP scheme","flexible protection requirement","static survivable multipath routing","integer linear programming model","ILP model","dynamic SM-RSA problem","dynamic traffic scenario","wavelength division multiplexing optical networks","WDM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic routing and spectrum allocation","Flexible optical networks","Multipath provisioning","Optical OFDM","Protection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic survivable multipath routing and spectrum allocation in OFDM-based flexible optical networks","volume":"6","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14057279","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic survivable multipath routing and spectrum allocation in OFDM-based flexible optical networks","sourcePdf":"77.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035166S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","isNumber":"6725814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"20","articleId":"6725826","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":6725832,"authors":[{"name":"Gokhan M.

First, by using the factor graph (FG) of the obtained generalized Ungerboeck metric for MOS and sum-product algorithm (SPA) framework, a highly efficient reduced state sequence estimation (RSSE) algorithm is proposed that operates on forward and backward directions and is directly applied to unwhitened channel matched filter (CMF) and code matched filter outputs at symbol rate. The proposed structure, generating the a posteriori probabilities (APP) by bidirectional RSSE recursions, are substantiated with symbol rate bidirectional decision feedback (BDF) based on surviving paths in order to eliminate the post- and pre-cursor inter-symbol interference (ISI) as well as multi code interference (MCI) due to the non-ideal properties of the signaling waveforms and multipath channel. It appears as the unification of Ungerboeck type reduced trellis equalization framework for MOS and achieves near-optimum performance especially for channels with large dispersion. Second, we identify a bias term through an error probability analysis which helps us improve the proposed receiver's performance. Furthermore, a tight approximation for the bit error rate (BER) of the proposed receiver is derived. These analyses lead to significant insight on the selection of system parameters and clearly demonstrate the high performance and efficiency of the proposed scheme by a proper choice of the signaling parameters.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.011114.130714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.011114.130714","startPage":"552","endPage":"566","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6748342/06725832.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6748342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Reduced-State Ungerboeck Type MAP Receiver with Bidirectional Decision Feedback for M-ary Quasi Orthogonal Signaling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2014","displayDocTitle":"A Reduced-State Ungerboeck Type MAP Receiver with Bidirectional Decision Feedback for M-ary Quasi Orthogonal Signaling","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2014","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2014","volume":"62","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6725832/","accessionNumber":"14128272","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725832/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Reduced-State Ungerboeck Type MAP Receiver with Bidirectional Decision Feedback for M-ary Quasi Orthogonal Signaling","sourcePdf":"552-tc1402-guven.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124235S","chronDate":"February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6748342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6748342","articleId":"6725832","onlineDate":"28 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6725861,"authors":[{"name":"Abhijeet Bishnu","affiliation":["Dept. of Elex. and Telecomm.

The settings of the relays must ensure that the protections should not operate in the overlapping (backup) areas, until the primary protections assigned to that area clear the fault. The scheme of protection must operate fast and selectively before the power system becomes unstable. So, in order to protect feeders and transmission lines, DOCRs must be optimally coordinated. This paper presents the analysis of DOCR coordination using Linear programming techniques and intervals. The coordination of DOCR is achieved by using Interval Simplex, Interval Two Phase Simplex and Interval Revised Simplex methods. The objective function which is to be minimized is stated as the sum of operating times of all the primary relays expressed in terms of the product of Time dial setting (TDS) for each relay, and a constant which is a function of ratio of fault current and pick up values of current. The inequality constraints framed according to close in fault and far end fault have the proper coordination margin for each primary/backup relay pair for a fault very close to relay pair. Here, the three methods are compared by taking a radial system, IEEE 3-bus system and IEEE 6-bus system as test cases for application of all the three programming techniques. The optimal setting of relays without any miscoordination is achieved in minimum operating time with bounded values. Also it is found that number of iterations in Revised Simplex is less and hence the time taken is less than the other two methods.","doi":"10.1109/INDCON.2013.6725883","publicationTitle":"2013 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6712175/6725842/06725883.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDCON.2013.6725883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6725842","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Directional overcurrent relays coordination using linear programming intervals: A comparative analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725883","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725883/","displayDocTitle":"Directional overcurrent relays coordination using linear programming intervals: A comparative analysis","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14062585","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6725883/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Directional overcurrent relays coordination using linear programming intervals: A comparative analysis","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"indicon2013submission1111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.151458S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6712175","isNumber":"6725842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6712175","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6725842","articleId":"6725883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6725895,"authors":[{"name":"Souvik Ghosh","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering Department, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Souvik","lastName":"Ghosh","id":"37086785621"},{"name":"Soumyadip Chatterjee","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering Department, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Soumyadip","lastName":"Chatterjee","id":"37086787802"},{"name":"Nadim Ahmed","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering Department, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Nadim","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37086788375"},{"name":"Iti Saha Misra","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering Department, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Iti Saha","lastName":"Misra","id":"38186220300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2275-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2274-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-940X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-9418"}],"articleNumber":"6725895","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Markov processes","Interference","Vectors","Ultrafast electronics","Power control","Steady-state","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","Markov processes","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference avoidance","cochannel deployment","macro femto network","Markov chain","femtocell function","base station","indoor wireless services","channel selection algorithm","power control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Co-Channel Macro-Femtocell network","Novel approach","Markov chain","power control","Interference reduction","blocking and dropping probability"]}],"abstract":"The function of a femtocell is to extend the cellular coverage to areas where the signal from base station cannot be received, thus improving the indoor wireless services. However, under the expected co-channel deployment of femto and macro-cells, a significant number of calls originating from femtocell users get dropped or blocked. This blocking rate problem must be controlled so that the femto users get quality of services. In this paper, the analytical system model is designed introducing a novel approach for solving Markov chain for increased number of femtocells. A channel selection algorithm along with power control is also being proposed in this paper to reduce the call dropping and blocking rates for femto users.

In recent times, it has been observed that most research is focused on building theoretical models which are backed mostly by simulation results. In order to successfully support any theoretically developed model, it is necessary that the algorithm be tested in practical environment using hardware. Since some assumptions made to satisfy simulation requirements may not hold under practical circumstances, the implementation and testing of a theoretical concept is quite challenging. In this paper, we present experimental test results from our implementation of improved energy detector for single node and co-operative CR networks. The theoretical model is taken from [1], while GNU Radio and universal software radio peripherals 2 (USRP2) kits serve as software and hardware, respectively, in the implementation. Shadowed fading (due to obstacles and hidden node problem) makes single node sensing sometimes unreliable. Use of cooperation among secondary nodes, along with proper fusion rules, not only exploits the advantage of spatial diversity but also improves the reliability of spectrum hole sensing, as evident from the test results. It has been demonstrated by using the practical testing that cooperative sensing is better than single node sensing.","doi":"10.1109/INDCON.2013.6725925","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6712175/6725842/06725925.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6725842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDCON.2013.6725925","publicationTitle":"2013 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved energy detector based spectrum sensing for cognitive radio: An experimental study","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725925","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Improved energy detector based spectrum sensing for cognitive radio: An experimental study","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725925/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6725925/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14062362","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved energy detector based spectrum sensing for cognitive radio: An experimental study","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"indicon2013submission240.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051096S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6712175","isNumber":"6725842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6712175","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6725842","articleId":"6725925","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6725930,"authors":[{"name":"Sindhuja Raghupatruni","affiliation":["Department of IT, CBIT, Hyderabad"],"firstName":"Sindhuja","lastName":"Raghupatruni","id":"37086677165"},{"name":"Niharika Nasam","affiliation":["Department of IT, CBIT, Hyderabad"],"firstName":"Niharika","lastName":"Nasam","id":"37086677392"},{"name":"Keerthi Lingam","affiliation":["Department of IT, CBIT, Hyderabad"],"firstName":"Keerthi","lastName":"Lingam","id":"37085442214"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2275-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2274-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-940X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-9418"}],"articleNumber":"6725930","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":508},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Educational institutions","Libraries","Books","Augmented reality","Computers","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["academic libraries","cloud computing","educational institutions","educational technology","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sixth sense enabled campus","cloud based approach","complete information","sixth sense technology","sixth sense enabled college","application cab","academic qualifications","student","noticeboards","library","data access","security issues"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sixth Sense Technology","Augmented Reality","Evolution","Applications"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725930","abstract":"Whenever we encounter a new object our senses try to sense and analyse that particular object and makes us interact with them. But to know the complete information about a particular object we should go through it in detail by surfing on net or asking the relevant person for information. Instead, sixth sense technology can be used to immediately trace the whole information about an object as soon as we see it. In this paper, we tried to design an application for sixth sense enabled college.

But designing such circuits lead to high occurrences of failure in the system. Hence there is a critical need for fault tolerance techniques for VLSI designs to increase the reliability of the system. Redundancy techniques are implemented widely to increase the reliability. By developing a fault tolerant system such as Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR), the FPGA can locate the errors and reconfigure the corrupted areas while maintaining the validity of system outputs. One of the drawbacks of this scheme is that the reliability of voter circuit is assumed to be perfect which may not be true. Hence, a novel fault-tolerant voter circuit (NFTVC) have been developed which is more reliable and leads to low power fault tolerant designs. Experimental results show that NFTVC is more reliable than the traditional TMR schemes. The hardware part of the design was done using Spartan-3 kit that is used for a rapid digital circuit. The system performance has been optimized using the Plan Ahead tool in Xilinx in order to reach and maintain the goals of the design. The implementation results provide a simultaneous improvement in power, delay and area.","doi":"10.1109/INDCON.2013.6725948","publicationTitle":"2013 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6712175/6725842/06725948.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDCON.2013.6725948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6725842","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of power optimized VLSI designs for reliable processing using majority circuit","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725948","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725948/","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of power optimized VLSI designs for reliable processing using majority circuit","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14062474","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6725948/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of power optimized VLSI designs for reliable processing using majority circuit","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"indicon2013submission311.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122562S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6712175","isNumber":"6725842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6712175","xplore-issue":"6725842","articleId":"6725948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6725950,"authors":[{"name":"Baisakhi Maity","affiliation":["School of Mobile Computing and Communication, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Baisakhi","lastName":"Maity","id":"37086674067"},{"name":"Anindita Kundu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Anindita","lastName":"Kundu","id":"37529281000"},{"name":"Iti Saha Misra","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Iti Saha","lastName":"Misra","id":"38186220300"},{"name":"Salil K.

However, due to high wallpenetration loss the signal quality falls below the desired level. Therefore, low power femto base stations are deployed inside the buildings to enhance the indoor coverage and signal strength. In this paper, we have considered a building area located at the cell edge. In the first part of the paper, we have observed the variation of signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR), packet loss rate and throughput for varied user density and number of channels. However, a huge number of femto cells may create significant amount of interference. Hence, the effect of the interference scenario is discussed and a power optimization algorithm to reduce the cross layer interference is proposed in the rest of the paper. After deploying power optimized femto cells, it is observed that the signal quality within the building has improved significantly.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6712175/6725842/06725950.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2013 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","doi":"10.1109/INDCON.2013.6725950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDCON.2013.6725950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6725842","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coverage extension and power optimization for closed group femto cells in BWA network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Buildings","Ultrafast optics","Femtocells","Packet loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","indoor radio","optimisation","packet radio networks","radio access networks","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed group femtocell","BWA network","wireless communication","signal quality","power femtocell base station","indoor coverage enhance","signal to interference plus noise ratio","SINR","packet loss rate","wireless channel","power optimization algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocell","Macrocell","Power Optimization","Interference","BWA network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725950/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Coverage extension and power optimization for closed group femto cells in BWA network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6725950/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14062432","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coverage extension and power optimization for closed group femto cells in BWA network","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"indicon2013submission317.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069421S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6712175","isNumber":"6725842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6712175","xplore-issue":"6725842","articleId":"6725950","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6725952,"authors":[{"name":"U.

A routing protocol is proposed and simulated where selection of intermediate nodes is governed by a parameter which combines the estimation of detection probability of neighbors in presence of large scale fading, and maximum advanced distance with respect to the final destination. Further, the proposed routing scheme is modified by incorporating route diversity. Lifetimes are analyzed in both the cases and compared.

It is obvious that future technology materials should exhibit higher mobility, better channel electrostatics, scalability, and robustness against process variations. Carbon nanotube based technology is very promising because it has most of these desired features. There is a need to explore the potential of this emerging technology by designing circuits based on this technology and comparing their performance with that of existing bulk CMOS technology for its rapid commercialization. Therefore, this paper presents a comparative study of CMOS version and CNFET version of Operational amplifier at 32-nm technology nodes. The performance of CNFET based amplifier has been thoroughly investigated in terms of its input resistance, output resistance and AC gain. This study shows that there is considerable improvement in the above feature of amplifier using CNFET. It is founded that CNFET based amplifier have 9 times AC gain, 100 times input r\u00e9sistance and output resistance decrease by 9 times compared to MOSFET based amplifier at 32-nm technology node. Furthermore, comparison between two technologies for same gain bandwidth product (GBP) has also been presented.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6725842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDCON.2013.6725973","publicationTitle":"2013 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6712175/6725842/06725973.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/INDCON.2013.6725973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of CNFET based operational amplifier at technology node beyond 45-nm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of CNFET based operational amplifier at technology node beyond 45-nm","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6725973/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14062434","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6725973/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of CNFET based operational amplifier at technology node beyond 45-nm","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"indicon2013submission381.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0805S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6712175","isNumber":"6725842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6712175","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6725842","articleId":"6725973","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6725977,"authors":[{"name":"Deepa Jose","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Guindy Anna University, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Deepa","lastName":"Jose","id":"37077267600"},{"name":"P Nirmal Kumar","affiliation":["Anna University Chennai, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, IN"],"firstName":"P Nirmal","lastName":"Kumar"},{"name":"A Arfath Hussain","affiliation":["Anna University Chennai, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, IN"],"firstName":"A Arfath","lastName":"Hussain"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2275-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2274-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-940X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-9418"}],"articleNumber":"6725977","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Vehicles","Adaptive systems","Fuzzy logic","Image edge detection","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","collision avoidance","distance measurement","fault tolerant control","field programmable gate arrays","fuzzy control","image processing","neurocontrollers","road vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant adaptive neuro-fuzzy based automated cruise controller","vehicle collisions","neuro-fuzzy based technique","image processing module","distance measurements","Sugeno type adaptive neuro-fuzzy system","mission critical system","fault tolerant field programmable gate array","FPGA implementation","neural network","adaptive neuro-fuzzy based method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","adaptive neuro-fuzzy","automated cruise control","fault tolerance","PDR"]}],"abstract":"The objective of the paper is to implement a system which effectively reduces vehicle collisions by using a combination of image processing and neuro-fuzzy based techniques.

For persons with moderate bilateral sensorineural loss, binaural dichotic presentation using a pair of complementary comb filters can reduce the effects of increased intraspeech spectral masking and thereby improve speech perception. It has been earlier shown that use of comb filters based on auditory critical bandwidths, with magnitude responses designed for perceptual balance of loudness and linear phase responses, resulted in a significant improvement in speech perception without adversely affecting localization of broadband sound sources. An FPGA-based implementation of these 513-coefficient filters with sampling frequency of 10 kHz is carried out for use in binaural hearing aids. Implementation using a 16bit codec and 15-bit integer filter coefficients used 47%, 34%, and 53% of combinational functions, logic registers, and logic elements, respectively, available on \u201cAltera Cyclone II EP2C70F896C6\u201d FPGA.

In this method, threshold is computed using the maximum and minimum wavelet coefficients at each level. Using this threshold and well known Hard thresholding process, the significant wavelet coefficients from each level are selected and denoised ECG signal is reconstructed with inverse wavelet transform. The performance of this method is compared with all well know wavelet shrinkage denoising methods with bior4.4 wavelet using root mean square error (RMSE) and signal to noise ratio (SNR) on MIT-BIH ECG database. The proposed threshold estimation is simple and faster compared to all existing threshold calculation methods namely VisuShrink, SureShrink, BayesShrink, and level-dependent threshold estimation and gives better SNR and RMSE. Proposed threshold estimation process decreases data sorting and storing resources allowing low-cost and faster implementation for portable biomedical devices.","doi":"10.1109/INDCON.2013.6726038","publicationTitle":"2013 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6712175/6725842/06726038.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDCON.2013.6726038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6725842","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New approach of threshold estimation for denoising ECG signal using wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6726038","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726038/","displayDocTitle":"New approach of threshold estimation for denoising ECG signal using wavelet transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14062472","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6726038/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New approach of threshold estimation for denoising ECG signal using wavelet transform","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"indicon2013submission607.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059131S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6712175","isNumber":"6725842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6712175","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6725842","articleId":"6726038","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6726065,"authors":[{"name":"Deepak Kumar Rout","affiliation":["Signal Processing and Communication Lab, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, Odisha, India"],"firstName":"Deepak Kumar","lastName":"Rout","id":"37071779700"},{"name":"Susmita Das","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, Odisha, India"],"firstName":"Susmita","lastName":"Das","id":"37404265900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2275-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2274-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-940X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-9418"}],"articleNumber":"6726065","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Body area networks","Sensors","Fingers","Narrowband","Wireless communication","Channel models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["body area networks","phase shift keying","radiofrequency interference","ultra wideband communication","wireless channels","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MHP pulse performance","TH BPSK","strong narrowband interference","UWB body area networks","BAN","wireless communication","remote health monitoring","wireless networks","Hermite pulses","narrowband interference suppression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BAN","interference mitigation","UWB","TH-BPSK","Narrowband interference","Rake"]}],"abstract":"Body Area Networks (BAN) is an emerging area in the field of wireless communication and remote health monitoring.

Most of the existing channel allocation techniques are Dynamic Channel Allocation based on various optimization algorithms, minimizing the call blocking probability by desolating electromagnetic compatibility constraints, which produces significant interferences for call dropping. Today's escalated non uniform traffic is dynamic with some fixed amount of traffic persistence. For such traffic behaviour and for solving a NP hard channel allocation problem, a Genetic Algorithm for Hybrid Channel Allocation technique is proposed. Interference graph based fitness function for Fixed; Dynamic and Hybrid Channel Allocation technique is applied. It is observed that, Fixed Channel Allocation has maximum call drop and call blocking probability without interference. The Dynamic and Hybrid Channel allocation has nearly same blocking probability. In Hybrid channel Allocation number of generations required for allocating the channels to cell and the interference is less leading to minimum call drop and call block probability when compared with Dynamic Channel Allocation.","doi":"10.1109/INDCON.2013.6726084","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6712175/6725842/06726084.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDCON.2013.6726084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6725842","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel allocation technique with genetic algorithm for interference reduction in cellular network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Interference","Channel allocation","Genetic algorithms","Biological cells","Mobile communication","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel allocation","genetic algorithms","probability","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation technique","genetic algorithm","interference reduction","cellular network","cellular communication services","NP hard dilemma","dynamic channel allocation","optimization algorithms","electromagnetic compatibility constraints","traffic behaviour","NP hard channel allocation problem","hybrid channel allocation technique","interference graph"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic Algorithm","Fixed Channel Allocation","Dynamic Channel Allocation","Hybrid Channel Allocation","Co-Channel and Adjacent Channel Interference","Interference Graph"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726084/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Channel allocation technique with genetic algorithm for interference reduction in cellular network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6726084/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14062621","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel allocation technique with genetic algorithm for interference reduction in cellular network","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"indicon2013submission755.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079258S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6712175","isNumber":"6725842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6712175","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6725842","articleId":"6726084","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6726107,"authors":[{"name":"Sachin S.

FFT will provide accurate harmonic estimation when the sampling is synchronous. If the sampling is asynchronous it leads to spectral leakage and picket fence effect. Depending upon the system fundamental frequency spectral leakage and picket fence effect will cause a huge error in harmonic estimation while using FFT algorithm with constant sampling rate. Different types of windows with good sidelobe and narrow main lobe width are used to condense spectral leakage and interpolation techniques are used to condense picket fence effect. Various algorithms are available in the literature to minimize the effects of spectral leakage and picket fence effect but they require huge computation time to solve higher order equations. In this paper a novel algorithm is introduced to transform asynchronous sampling to synchronous sampling with customized mathematical formula. It mainly focuses on reducing the spectral leakage effect with less computation involved. The major advantage of the proposed method is that it can easily calculate harmonic parameters without solving any higher order polynomial equation. Simulation results illustrate that this method can enhance the accuracy of harmonic analysis by reducing spectral leakage efficiently.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Power system harmonics","Discrete Fourier transforms","Estimation","Algorithm design and analysis","Accuracy","Frequency synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","harmonic analysis","power system harmonics","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronous sampling algorithm","power system harmonic analysis","FFT algorithm","spectral leakage effect reduction","fast Fourier transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asynchronous sampling","Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)","Harmonic estimation","Spectral leakage","Synchronous sampling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/INDCON.2013.6726111","publicationTitle":"2013 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6712175/6725842/06726111.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6725842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDCON.2013.6726111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel synchronous sampling algorithm for power system harmonic analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6726111","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel synchronous sampling algorithm for power system harmonic analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726111/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6726111/","accessionNumber":"14062565","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel synchronous sampling algorithm for power system harmonic analysis","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"indicon2013submission832.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080629S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6712175","isNumber":"6725842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6712175","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6725842","articleId":"6726111","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6726116,"authors":[{"name":"Pravindra Kumar","affiliation":["School of Computing and Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Mandi, (H.P), India"],"firstName":"Pravindra","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085586358"},{"name":"Anand Srivastava","affiliation":["School of Computing and Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Mandi, (H.P), India"],"firstName":"Anand","lastName":"Srivastava","id":"37085469117"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2275-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2274-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-940X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-9418"}],"articleNumber":"6726116","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":277},"abstract":"Passive optical network (PON) based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM-PON) is a promising candidate for high optical access network due to its greater resistance to fiber dispersion. High spectral efficiency is also achieved due to the orthogonality among all sub-carriers which overlap in the frequency domain. Two-dimensional (2-D) signal mapper and one-dimensional (1-D) inverse fast fourier transform (IFFT) are the major elements of the conventional OFDM communication system. In this paper, we use the concept of three-dimensional (3-D) signal mapper and 2-D IFFT which is called as 3-D OFDM communication system. The performance of 40 Gb/s 2-D OFDM-PON and 3-D OFDM-PON using multi-level modulation scheme under various system impairments is analytically analyzed for coherent optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CO-OFDM) without using any optical dispersion compensation. As bit error rate (BER) depends on minimum Euclidean distance (MED) which is 15.46 % more in case of 3-D OFDM as compared to 2-D OFDM.

In this study, S-transform is used to extract the eight features which are appended with four temporal features. In this work, the performances of two approaches are compared to classify the five classes of ECG beats which is recommended by AAMI EC57 1998 standard (Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation). The first approach uses temporal and S-transform based feature set, whereas the second approach uses the wavelet transform based features. These features from two approaches are independently classified using feed forward neural network (NN). Performance is evaluated on several normal and abnormal ECG signals of the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database using two techniques such as temporal and S-transform with NN classifier (TST-NN) and other wavelet transform with NN classifier (WT-NN). The experimental results demonstrate that the TST-NN technique shows better performance compared to the WT-NN technique.","doi":"10.1109/INDCON.2013.6726153","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2013 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDCON.2013.6726153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6725842","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6712175/6725842/06726153.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ECG arrhythmia recognition using artificial neural network with S-transform based effective features","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726153/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"ECG arrhythmia recognition using artificial neural network with S-transform based effective features","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6726153/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14062473","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ECG arrhythmia recognition using artificial neural network with S-transform based effective features","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"indicon2013submission985.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094181S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6712175","isNumber":"6725842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6712175","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6725842","articleId":"6726153","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6726154,"authors":[{"name":"Rohan Mukherjee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Rohan","lastName":"Mukherjee","id":"38239444400"},{"name":"Vikrant Mahajan","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Vikrant","lastName":"Mahajan","id":"37086651630"},{"name":"Indrajit Chakrabarti","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Indrajit","lastName":"Chakrabarti","id":"37268712300"},{"name":"Somnath Sengupta","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Somnath","lastName":"Sengupta","id":"37272662800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2275-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2274-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-940X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-9418"}],"articleNumber":"6726154","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High performance VLSI implementation of CAVLC decoder of H.264/AVC for HD transmission","abstract":"Context-based Adaptive Variable Length Coding (CAVLC) has been adopted by the latest video coding standard H.264 as one of its entropy encoding techniques.

In this paper, we examine how Cloud computing can provide adaptive user interfaces to people with disabilities in order to enable them accessing AT tools in form of Software as a Service (SaaS). The proposed solution consists in creating adaptive user interfaces deploying AT tools in Virtual Machines (VMs) which users can manage through the Internet. By using an HTML5-based web interface, computer users with disabilities are able to interact with personalized virtual desktops from any networked computer by means of a web browser without having to setup additional software on the physical machine. Nevertheless, using AT software in web-accessed VMs is not so easy as well as in physical Desktops, because several issues have to be overcome. In order to address such issues, we discuss an architecture integrating Guacamole, i.e., an HTML5 remote desktop gateway, Virtual Network Computing (VNC), i.e., a technology to control a remote Desktop, Virtual Box, i.e., a virtual machine monitor (or hyper visor), and CLEVER a Virtual Infrastructure Manager (VIM) middleware.","doi":"10.1109/UIC-ATC.2013.42","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing and 2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Autonomic and Trusted Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing and 2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Autonomic and Trusted Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6724531/6726171/06726193.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UIC-ATC.2013.42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726171","startPage":"72","endPage":"79","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Virtualization and Guacamole/VNC to Provide Adaptive User Interfaces to Disabled People in Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6726193","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Using Virtualization and Guacamole/VNC to Provide Adaptive User Interfaces to Disabled People in Cloud Computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726193/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14064452","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6726193/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Virtualization and Guacamole/VNC to Provide Adaptive User Interfaces to Disabled People in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Vietri sul Mare, Italy","sourcePdf":"2481a072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054274S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6724531","isNumber":"6726171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6724531","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6726171","articleId":"6726193","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6726211,"authors":[{"name":"Utsav Drolia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Utsav","lastName":"Drolia","id":"38076099700"},{"name":"Rolando Martins","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Rolando","lastName":"Martins","id":"37591486500"},{"name":"Jiaqi Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Jiaqi","lastName":"Tan","id":"37085512285"},{"name":"Ankit Chheda","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Ankit","lastName":"Chheda","id":"37086772255"},{"name":"Monil Sanghavi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Monil","lastName":"Sanghavi","id":"37086776092"},{"name":"Rajeev Gandhi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Rajeev","lastName":"Gandhi","id":"37430682200"},{"name":"Priya Narasimhan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Priya","lastName":"Narasimhan","id":"37273313700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2482-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2481-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6726211","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1219},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","IEEE 802.11 Standards","Performance evaluation","Image edge detection","Batteries","Smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile edge-clouds","mobile applications","end-user device","thin client","infrastructure cloud","computational capabilities","mobile devices","thick clients","offloading computation","battery power consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["edge-cloud","mobile-cloud","mapreduce","offloading","hadoop"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6726211","abstract":"Current mobile applications treat the end-user device as a \"thin client,\" with all of the heavy computations being offloaded to an infrastructure cloud.

In this paper, we study the trade-offs between offloading computation to an infrastructure cloud versus retaining the computation within a mobile edge-cloud. To this end, we develop and run two classes of applications on both types of clouds, and we analyze the performance of the two clouds in terms of the time taken to run the application, along with the total amount of battery power consumed in both cases. Our results indicate that there are indeed classes of applications where an edge-cloud can outperform an infrastructure cloud in terms of both latency and battery power.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726171","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing and 2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Autonomic and Trusted Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing and 2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Autonomic and Trusted Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6724531/6726171/06726211.pdf","doi":"10.1109/UIC-ATC.2013.94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UIC-ATC.2013.94","startPage":"209","endPage":"215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Case for Mobile Edge-Clouds","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726211/","displayDocTitle":"The Case for Mobile Edge-Clouds","htmlLink":"/document/6726211/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14064490","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Case for Mobile Edge-Clouds","confLoc":"Vietri sul Mare, Italy","sourcePdf":"2481a209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055956S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6724531","isNumber":"6726171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6724531","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6726171","articleId":"6726211","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6726233,"authors":[{"name":"Annarita Drago","affiliation":["Universit\u00e0 \u201cFederico II\u201d di Napoli, Dip. di Ingegneria Elettrica e Tecnologie dell'Informarione"],"firstName":"Annarita","lastName":"Drago","id":"38241386800"},{"name":"Stefano Marrone","affiliation":["Seconda Universit\u00e0 di Napoli, Dip. di Matematica e Fisica"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Marrone","id":"37593402000"},{"name":"Nicola Mazzocca","affiliation":["Seconda Universit\u00e0 di Napoli, Dip. di Matematica e Fisica"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Mazzocca","id":"37297178500"},{"name":"Annarita Tedesco","affiliation":["Ansaldo STS, Innovation & Competitiveness Unit"],"firstName":"Annarita","lastName":"Tedesco","id":"37606062300"},{"name":"Valeria Vittorini","affiliation":["Universit\u00e0 \u201cFederico II\u201d di Napoli, Dip. di Ingegneria Elettrica e Tecnologie dell'Informarione"],"firstName":"Valeria","lastName":"Vittorini","id":"37273278500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2482-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2481-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6726233","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":216},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unified modeling language","Analytical models","Rail transportation","Security","Bayes methods","Computational modeling","Resilience"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","railways","Unified Modeling Language"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model-driven estimation","distributed vulnerability","complex railway networks","critical infrastructures","protection systems","resilience analysis","VAM UML profile","cyber-physical systems","Bayesian network model","protection improvement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cyber-Physical Protection Systems","Railway Networks","Bayesian Networks","Critical Infrastructure Modeling","Resilience Evaluation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6726233","abstract":"The high level of interconnection and interdependency between critical infrastructures demands for novel methodologies and techniques to improve their resilience by evaluating the vulnerability of these systems in presence of attacks. Railway networks, as all other critical infrastructures (electrical, communication, etc.), are highly interconnected. One of the most valuable tasks in designing protection systems is detecting the critical nodes. This paper introduces a model-driven approach in order to accomplish such resilience analysis. The network is modeled by using the CIP_VAM UML profile that provides a way to model complex cyber-physical systems in a unifying manner with respect to services, components, attacks and protections: a special focus is on the modeling of the inter-dependencies between infrastructures. Then the vulnerability analysis is performed by generating a Bayesian Network model capable to take into account probabilistic relationships between nodes that translate services, components, attacks and protections. Such approach allows for sensitivity analyses in order to detect vulnerability flaws for an effective and efficient protection improvement.","doi":"10.1109/UIC-ATC.2013.78","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UIC-ATC.2013.78","startPage":"380","endPage":"387","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing and 2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Autonomic and Trusted Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6724531/6726171/06726233.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing and 2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Autonomic and Trusted Computing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-Driven Estimation of Distributed Vulnerability in Complex Railway Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Model-Driven Estimation of Distributed Vulnerability in Complex Railway Networks","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6726233/","accessionNumber":"14064506","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726233/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-Driven Estimation of Distributed Vulnerability in Complex Railway Networks","confLoc":"Vietri sul Mare, Italy","sourcePdf":"2481a380.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058534S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6724531","isNumber":"6726171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6724531","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6726171","articleId":"6726233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6726242,"authors":[{"name":"Jason Cohen","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Towson University/Hewlett Packard Company Towson, USA"],"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Cohen","id":"38571038500"},{"name":"Subatra Acharya","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Towson University, Towson, USA"],"firstName":"Subatra","lastName":"Acharya","id":"37086794596"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2482-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2481-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6726242","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":329},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards a Trusted Hadoop Storage Platform: Design Considerations of an AES Based Encryption Scheme with TPM Rooted Key Protections","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing and 2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Autonomic and Trusted Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6724531/6726171/06726242.pdf","startPage":"444","endPage":"451","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing and 2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Autonomic and Trusted Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UIC-ATC.2013.57","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726171","doi":"10.1109/UIC-ATC.2013.57","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encryption","Software","Throughput","Java","Nickel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","data integrity","storage management","trusted computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trusted Hadoop storage platform","AES based encryption","TPM rooted key protections","trusted computing technologies","Apache Hadoop distributed file system","HDFS","data confidentiality","data integrity validation","data-at-rest encryption","trusted computing group","TCG","trusted platform module","encryption framework","hardware key protections","AES-NI","encryption acceleration","crypto framework"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hadoop","HDFS","Trusted Computing","Encryption","AES-NI"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6726242","abstract":"This paper will examine the concept of combining trusted computing technologies with the Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) in an effort to address concerns of data confidentiality and integrity.

Monitoring EEG has been recognized to be an efficient way to detect abnormalities in neural processes. Traditional techniques for data management are not appropriate for continuous monitoring, any more. A Smart monitoring architecture is required to inherently integrate different technologies, allow seamless integration of different processes including: data gathering, processing, analytics, and visualization. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end architecture based on SOA and other emerging technologies to support continuous monitoring of patients with neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease. The silent feature of the proposed solution is to incorporate smartness at all levels of monitoring activities from sensing to data storage, processing, and visualization. We evaluated the proposed architecture using an illustrative scenario of monitoring of patients with Parkinson's disease. We described the current implementation efforts and we highlighted how the proposed monitoring solution implemented smartness at a various monitoring processes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart End-to-End Infrastructural Solution for Monitoring Patients with Neurological Disorders","doi":"10.1109/UIC-ATC.2013.100","endPage":"649","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing and 2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Autonomic and Trusted Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6724531/6726171/06726273.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing and 2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Autonomic and Trusted Computing","startPage":"644","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UIC-ATC.2013.100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726171","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6726273","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Data visualization","Electroencephalography","Diseases","Sensors","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data acquisition","data analysis","data visualisation","diseases","electroencephalography","medical disorders","medical signal detection","neurophysiology","patient monitoring","service-oriented architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart end-to-end infrastructural solution","neurological disorder monitoring","intensive brain signals","continuous brain signals","heterogeneous brain signals","EEG monitoring","neural processes","abnormality detection","traditional techniques","data management","smart monitoring architecture","seamless integration","data gathering","data processing","data analytics","data visualization","end-to-end architecture","SOA","continuous patient monitoring","Parkinson's disease","monitoring activities","data storage","monitoring solution","monitoring processes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["smart monitoring","SOA","Parkinson's disease","neurological diseases"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Smart End-to-End Infrastructural Solution for Monitoring Patients with Neurological Disorders","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726273/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6726273/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14064509","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart End-to-End Infrastructural Solution for Monitoring Patients with Neurological Disorders","confLoc":"Vietri sul Mare, Italy","sourcePdf":"2481a644.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050826S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6724531","isNumber":"6726171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6724531","xplore-issue":"6726171","articleId":"6726273","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6726319,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37072022500"},{"name":"Sebastian Hoyos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Hoyos","id":"38367773800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3429-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5159-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6726319","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":158},"abstract":"Next-generation Wireless Body Sensor Networks (WBSNs) calls for miniaturization and power-efficient integration for long-term monitoring, real-time diagnostics and patient-centered healthcare solutions. However, state-of-the-art WBSN prototypes remain challenged by stringent power constraints and large form factors. The recently proposed asynchronous compressive sensing scheme suggests an efficient way to improve power consumption by reducing the data volume in energy-hungry radio links. In this paper, we present a modified front-end called Asynchronous Binary Compressive Sensing (ABCS) for WBSNs. A low-cost reconstruction method is proposed that exploits the embedded binary signal structure in the ABCS. By incorporating binary amplitude as a prior, better signal recovery performance is obtained comparing with the traditional approaches. Analyses and simulations with an ECG recording confirm the ABCS front-end outperforms the conventional CS approaches in terms of hardware complexity, power consumption and system flexibility.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 9th International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/6724377/6726286/06726319.pdf","startPage":"121","endPage":"126","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 9th International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks","doi":"10.1109/MSN.2013.14","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSN.2013.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726286","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6726319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous Binary Compressive Sensing for Wireless Body Sensor Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matching pursuit algorithms","Electrocardiography","Complexity theory","Power demand","Compressed sensing","Wireless communication","Ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["body sensor networks","compressed sensing","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low cost reconstruction method","radio links","power consumption","patient centered healthcare solutions","real time diagnostics","long term monitoring","power efficient integration","next generation wireless body sensor networks","asynchronous binary compressive sensing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["binary matching pursuit","compressive sensing","wireless body sensor network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726319/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous Binary Compressive Sensing for Wireless Body Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6726319/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14077866","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous Binary Compressive Sensing for Wireless Body Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"3429a121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091303S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6724377","isNumber":"6726286","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6724377","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6726286","articleId":"6726319","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6726326,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Users are mobile, dynamic and majority prefer the 30MHz - 3000MHz band of the 300GHz spectrum due to propagation and equipment feasibility, rendering spectrum finite and constrained since virtually all radio-frequency (RF) spectrum is licensed. Cognitive radio (CR), a novel approach, sharing unoccupied spectrum by secondary users (SUs) while minimising interference to satisfy service (QoS) of PUs. The paper provides basis for exploiting the Uganda's spectrum sharing guideline and generally CR in Uganda.

The spectrum usage in shows relatively high utilisation in the FM, TV and mobile bands with high underutilisation of RF spectrum, for the Ugandan indoor and outdoor radio environment over a week. Further measures and statistics including channel occupancy/vacancy statistics, channel utilization from spectrum detected above the power threshold per band, are compared to other cities.

Meanwhile, cloud computing is playing an increasingly role in people's daily life. Together with these two promising technologies, Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) has been introduced as a potential technology in future. However, since the mobility of cloud users in MCC, service availability becomes one of the significant challenges which has to be addressed. This paper introduces an efficient social based data forwarding mechanism to improve the service availability of MCC under Ad Hoc network environment. Users in MCC are treated as entity nodes with social characteristics as well as can be grouped into different communities. Thus mobile user can connect to the cloud through neighbouring nodes instead of direct link to clouds. By using this mechanism, the service availability will be improved with the improvement of data forwarding efficiency. We performed simulation of our technique on CloudSim. The empirical results show that the proposed mechanism is promising in enabling the mobile nodes to be efficiently searched.","doi":"10.1109/MSN.2013.59","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 9th International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 9th International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/6724377/6726286/06726358.pdf","startPage":"365","endPage":"372","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSN.2013.59","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726286","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Social Based Data Forwarding Mechanism for Mobile Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726358/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Social Based Data Forwarding Mechanism for Mobile Cloud Computing","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6726358/","accessionNumber":"14064207","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Social Based Data Forwarding Mechanism for Mobile Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"3429a365.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069005S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6724377","isNumber":"6726286","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6724377","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6726286","articleId":"6726358","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6726359,"authors":[{"name":"Yaser Jararweh","affiliation":["Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan"],"firstName":"Yaser","lastName":"Jararweh","id":"37322599600"},{"name":"Loai Tawalbeh","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Umm-Alqura University, Makka, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Loai","lastName":"Tawalbeh","id":"37282658400"},{"name":"Fadi Ababneh","affiliation":["Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan"],"firstName":"Fadi","lastName":"Ababneh","id":"37086764766"},{"name":"Fahd Dosari","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Umm-Alqura University, Makka, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Fahd","lastName":"Dosari","id":"37086761508"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3429-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5159-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6726359","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":76,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Mobile handsets","Mobile communication","Computer architecture","Mobile computing","Computational modeling","IEEE 802.11 Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","cloud computing","Long Term Evolution","mobile computing","notebook computers","resource allocation","smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource efficient mobile computing","cloudlet infrastructure","mobile cloud computing","battery lifetime","processing power","storage capacity","mobile device jobs","cloud system","required power reduction","required time reduction","high network latency","transmission power consumption reduction","3G connections","LTE connections","cloudlet based MCC system","communication latency reduction","smart phones","tablets","network delay reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile Cloud Computing","Cloudlet","Network Performance","Wirless Communication"]}],"abstract":"Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) has been introduced as a viable solution to the inherited limitations of mobile computing. These limitations include battery lifetime, processing power, and storage capacity. By using MCC, the processing and the storage of intensive mobile device jobs will take place in the cloud system and the results will be returned to the mobile device. This will reduce the required power and time for completing such intensive jobs. However, connecting mobile devices with the cloud suffers from the high network latency and the huge transmission power consumption especially when using 3G/LTE connections. In this paper, we introduce a Cloudlet based MCC system aiming to reduce the power consumption and the network delay while using MCC. We merged the MCC concepts with the proposed Cloudlet framework and propose a new framework for the MCC model. Our practical experimental results showed that using the proposed model reduces the power consumption from the mobile device, besides reducing the communication latency when the mobile device requests a job to take place remotely while keeping high quality of service stander.","doi":"10.1109/MSN.2013.75","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 9th International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/6724377/6726286/06726359.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSN.2013.75","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 9th International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks","startPage":"373","endPage":"377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Efficient Mobile Computing Using Cloudlet Infrastructure","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6726359","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Resource Efficient Mobile Computing Using Cloudlet Infrastructure","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726359/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6726359/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14064145","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Efficient Mobile Computing Using Cloudlet Infrastructure","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"3429a373.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066404S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6724377","isNumber":"6726286","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6724377","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"6726286","articleId":"6726359","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6726382,"authors":[{"name":"Xing Xiaoxue","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Xing","lastName":"Xiaoxue","id":"37085442118"},{"name":"Liu Fu","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Fu","id":"37897637400"},{"name":"Shang Weiwei","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Shang","lastName":"Weiwei","id":"38542422600"},{"name":"Lei Yanmin","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Changchun University, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Yanmin","id":"38061337800"},{"name":"Ji Shujiao","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Changchun University, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Shujiao","id":"37085843803"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3429-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5159-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6726382","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":186},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matching pursuit algorithms","Image fusion","Medical diagnostic imaging","Transforms","Image reconstruction","Filter banks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","gradient methods","image fusion","medical image processing","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical image fusion","compressed sensing","non subsampled Contourlet transform","contour let transform","sharp contrast","average gradient","image entropy","relative quality","standard deviation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Medical Images","NSCT","CS","Image Fusion"]}],"abstract":"In order to get better results and faster speed on medical image fusion, a method based on non-sub sampled contour let transform in compressed sensing was proposed.

Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) provide great computational power in standard desktop computers, being composed of many simple execution units. In this paper a technique is presented for the parallel implementation of neural networks in GPUs. The technique is explained in relation to the difficulties imposed by the execution model of GPUs.

This paper models PSP as a multiobjective optimization problem and adopts Adaptive Differential Evolution for Multiobjective Problems (ADEMO/D) to minimize potential energies (bonded and non-bonded) providing final protein structures. ADEMO/D incorporates concepts of Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) and mechanisms of mutation strategies adaptation. In this work the probability matching and extreme absolute reward methods are combined to adapt ADEMO/D to the PSP context. The DE mutation strategy is chosen from a candidate pool according to a probability that depends on its received reward.

Firefly algorithm is one of the evolutionary optimization algorithms, and is inspired by the flashing behaviour of fireflies in nature. There are many noisy non-linear mathematical optimization problems that can be effectively solved by Metaheuristic Algorithms. Mathematical optimization or programming is the study of such planning and design problems using mathematical tools. Nowadays, computer simulations become an indispensable tool for solving such optimization problems with various efficient search algorithms. Nature-inspired algorithms are among the most powerful algorithms for optimization. Firefly algorithm is one of the new metaheuristic algorithms for optimization problems. The algorithm is inspired by the flashing behaviour of fireflies. A Firefly Algorithm (FA) is a recent nature inspired optimization algorithm, which simulates the flash pattern and characteristics of fireflies. It is a powerful swarm intelligence algorithm inspired by the flash phenomenon of the fireflies. In this context, three types of meta-heuristics called Artificial bee Colony algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Firefly algorithms were devised to find optimal solutions of noisy non-linear continuous mathematical models. A series of computational experiments using each algorithm were conducted. The stimulation result of this experiment were analyzed and compared to the best solutions found so The Firefly algorithm in each noisy non linear optimization function seems to perform better and efficient.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726474","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726462","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6715259/6726462/06726474.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation performance study of Firefly algorithm, particle swarm optimization and artificial bee colony algorithm for non-linear mathematical optimization functions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726474/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evaluation performance study of Firefly algorithm, particle swarm optimization and artificial bee colony algorithm for non-linear mathematical optimization functions","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6726474/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14063404","publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation performance study of Firefly algorithm, particle swarm optimization and artificial bee colony algorithm for non-linear mathematical optimization functions","confLoc":"Tiruchengode, India","sourcePdf":"117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057885S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6715259","isNumber":"6726462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6715259","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6726462","articleId":"6726474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6726481,"authors":[{"name":"Shumit Saha","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Communication Engineering, Khulna University of Engineering & Technology, Khulna, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Shumit","lastName":"Saha","id":"38488976300"},{"name":"Md.

This public key cryptography technique is widely used for providing strong security. By using this RSASS method, the data storage correctness is assured and identification of misbehaving server with high probability is achieved. This method also supports dynamic operation on the data. The proposed Scheme supports dynamic operation using RSA signature and manipulating the classic Merkle Hash Tree construction.

They are generally used in designing, testing, troubleshooting, and repairing electronic or electro acoustic devices, though they often have artistic uses as well. Many features added to function generators have complicated their design and increased their cost. We cannot create any arbitrary waveform. There is an opportunity for a radical redesign of the familiar function generator using Direct Digital Frequency Synthesis (DDFS). In this paper we present a hardware efficient architecture by using CORDIC algorithm for the calculation of sine and cosine functions for DDFS. This approach is simulated using ModelSim simulation software, synthesized using Xilinx ISE design suite and the proposed architecture is implemented on Xilinx FPGA target device i.e. SPARTAN 3E. Finally, the device utilization summary and timing reports are presented, finally we revised CORDIC algorithm implementation in 180 nm standard CMOS technology using Synopsys tools and investigate its performance The dominant factor favourable to ASICs is their lower power consumption, which is of primary concern for DDFS devices and their lower cost in large volumes.

This routing problem is solved by using Different types of routing algorithms, here we use Coarse-Grained Parallel GA-Based shortest path algorithm. Time computation is the vital parameter in all routing methods. The very shortest path routing algorithm involves reduce time of the transferring data. Using genetic algorithm we can find an efficient path. This algorithm found by using the nature of the genetic operation. Genetic algorithm is used to change the genes from one sub-population to another sub-population in a proper manner. In this paper discussion is going through both simple genetic algorithm and Parallel genetic algorithm and compares performance of both. Here Migration strategy is used to replace the genes. There are four types of strategies that are used to change the genes. These are: Best replace Worst, Best replace Random, Random replace Random, Random replace Worst, Random replace Random. Among these four types of Strategies worst replace best gives the better performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726511/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14063390","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6726511/","publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Enhancement of coarse-grained parallel genetic algorithm for shortest path routing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancement of coarse-grained parallel genetic algorithm for shortest path routing","confLoc":"Tiruchengode, India","sourcePdf":"179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119388S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6715259","isNumber":"6726462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6715259","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6726462","articleId":"6726511","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6726524,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The wide spread deployment of WLAN has also brought new challenges to security and privacy. Anomaly detection is fast becoming a key element of intrusion detection systems, in which perturbations from normal behavior suggest the presence of intentionally or unintentionally induced attacks, faults, defects, etc. Accurately detecting such anomalies has become an important problem for the network community. We need to distinguish anomalies that change the traffic either abruptly or slowly. While a good amount of research has been done for fixed wired networks, not much research has been done in this area for wireless networks due to lack of a good data set. Hence we developed a discrimination algorithm using correlation coefficient to detect anomalies in the Wireless traffic and demonstrated the effectiveness.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6715259/6726462/06726547.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726547","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6726547","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting anomalies in WLAN using discrimination algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ad hoc networks","Wireless LAN","Wireless networks","Intrusion detection","Communication system security","Telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","data privacy","telecommunication traffic","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","WLAN","discrimination algorithm","wireless local area network","security","privacy","intrusion detection systems","network community","correlation coefficient","wireless traffic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless LAN","Anomaly detection","Correlation Coefficient","Security","Discrimination Algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726547/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Detecting anomalies in WLAN using discrimination algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6726547/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14063239","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting anomalies in WLAN using discrimination algorithm","confLoc":"Tiruchengode, India","sourcePdf":"242.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035165S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6715259","isNumber":"6726462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6715259","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6726462","articleId":"6726547","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6726549,"authors":[{"name":"U.

Then the feature selection based on the information gain is performed to select the subset of features that gives the highest classification accuracy. Only the feature belongingness of the selected features is aggregated by using sum aggregation reasoning rule to compute the pattern belongingness to the given classes. These values of feature or pattern belongingness are useful for high level decision making. Finally by using defuzzification operation each pattern is assigned to the predicted class. In this paper, the proposed model is applied to four datasets: IRIS, BUPA, PIMA and WINE. Accuracy of the results is measured by using the performance measures-Misclassification, Percentage of overall class accuracy and Kappa index of agreement.

The nomadic users in the network deploys high infrastructure usually in the form of picocells, microcells, hotspots, etc. A new alternative concept involving fewer infrastructures is the deployment of home base station known as femtocells. These femtocells are small, low power cellular base station which are installed at home or small business enterprises with the help of internet connection. In this paper, two-tier heterogeneous networks are formed by installing femtocells with the macrocellular networks that creates an interference problem between them. By examining the performance of the system with imperfect channel state information associated with channel estimation, feedback delay and quantisation error, we obtain the improved power control level for femtocells and null interference using beam generation. In order to mitigate the interference, we propose a method of improving the power control for femtocells and beamforming to maximise the macrouser and femtouser SINR. Simulation results are analysed using NS-2 software.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726551","publicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6715259/6726462/06726551.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved power control for femtocells in the presence of channel uncertainty","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6726551","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726551/","displayDocTitle":"Improved power control for femtocells in the presence of channel uncertainty","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14063379","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6726551/","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved power control for femtocells in the presence of channel uncertainty","confLoc":"Tiruchengode, India","sourcePdf":"25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111484S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6715259","isNumber":"6726462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6715259","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6726462","articleId":"6726551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6726555,"authors":[{"name":"Pratik P Jariwala","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Communication, Sarvajanik College of Engineering & Technology, Surat, Gujarat, India"],"firstName":"Pratik P","lastName":"Jariwala","id":"37086766130"},{"name":"Pranav Lapsiwala","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Communication, Sarvajanik College of Engineering & Technology, Surat, Gujarat, India"],"firstName":"Pranav","lastName":"Lapsiwala","id":"37085997533"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3926-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3925-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6726555","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Review: Performance evolution of different detection techniques in V-BLAST","abstract":"Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) channels can offer high capacity to wireless systems and the capacity increases linearly with the number of antennas.

The proposed antenna is designed over an operating frequency range of 2.57 GHz using the substrate material as FR-4 which has the dielectric constant of 4.4. This new shape of antenna has the swastika shaped slot between the patches which improves the efficiency and helps to reduce the prioritized parameter of mimo antenna which is nothing but the mutual coupling. This antenna can be applicable to the wireless communication areas such as Wi-Fi and WiMAX. The parameters such as return loss, VSWR, mutual coupling, directivity and gain has been simulated and analyzed.

This is because in order to maximize the system throughput, the communication systems employ very tight frequency reuse. This leads to interference limited systems where the interference is highest at the cell edges. The key ingredients of such networks are the receivers that are able to exploit the structure of the interference instead of nullifying or attenuating it. One such interference suppression strategy based on a low complexity matched filter (MF) based receiver has been proposed. The matched filter is the optimal linear filter for maximizing the signal to noise ratio (SNR) in the presence of additive stochastic noise. Normally all the interferences are assumed to be Gaussian and are merged with noise, but with the proposed receiver exploitation of the structure of the existing dominant interference while detection occurs is made possible. Analysis of the Minimum mean square error (MMSE) has been done and it has been observed how the detector not only recuperates the diversity(the maximum number of independent copies of the transmitted signal in a particular communication system) order lost by MMSE but also exhibits a coding gain as the interference gets stronger.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726579","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726579","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6715259/6726462/06726579.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inter-cell interference mitigation for cell edge users","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Inter-cell interference mitigation for cell edge users","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6726579/","accessionNumber":"14063264","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726579/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inter-cell interference mitigation for cell edge users","confLoc":"Tiruchengode, India","sourcePdf":"293.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039484S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6715259","isNumber":"6726462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6715259","xplore-issue":"6726462","articleId":"6726579","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6726596,"authors":[{"name":"Aman Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Graphic Era University, Dehradun, India"],"firstName":"Aman","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37086711668"},{"name":"Emmanuel S.

As cloud computing provides the facility to the cloud users to send multiple request simultaneously, there must be a self managing/provisioning scheme that all resources are made available to the requesting users in the efficient manner to satisfy their requirement and for improvement of resource utilization. In this paper we proposed an efficient framework named called EARA (Efficient Agent based Resource Allocation) for resource allocation based on agent computing on SaaS level in Cloud Computing.

SVM gives much better classification, out of wide variety of class discrimination algorithms which deals with huge collection of data. Here genetic algorithm (GA) and self-organised feature map (SOFM) are used to enhance the feature and information extraction from a huge dataset similar to KDD99. GA gives us the most prominent features contributing to the anomalous behaviour of a connection and SOFM helps to identify similar groups from the dataset by using the similarity metric.

The proposed squarer saves area by almost 50% and reduces delay by 50% when compared with duplex squarer in 32-bit case.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726607","publicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6715259/6726462/06726607.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and FPGA implementation of binary squarer using Vedic mathematics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726607/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Design and FPGA implementation of binary squarer using Vedic mathematics","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6726607/","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14063514","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2013","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and FPGA implementation of binary squarer using Vedic mathematics","confLoc":"Tiruchengode, India","sourcePdf":"331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059579S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6715259","isNumber":"6726462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6715259","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6726462","articleId":"6726607","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6726609,"authors":[{"name":"Shefaly Sharma","affiliation":["Computer science and Engineering, Lovely Professional University, Phagwara, Punjab"],"firstName":"Shefaly","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37086648740"},{"name":"Jaspreet Kaur","affiliation":["Computer science and Engineering, Lovely Professional University, Phagwara, Punjab"],"firstName":"Jaspreet","lastName":"Kaur","id":"37085679500"},{"name":"Shipra Gupta","affiliation":["Computer science and Engineering, Lovely Professional University, Phagwara, Punjab"],"firstName":"Shipra","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37086646361"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3926-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3925-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6726609","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Wavelet transforms","PSNR","Robustness","Image coding","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Haar transforms","image watermarking","innovation management","Internet","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified fast Haar wavelet transformation","MFHWT","Internet technology","innovative applications","security of data","image watermarking","image analysis","peak signal to noise ratio","PSNR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PSNR","MFHWT","MSE","Image Processing","Digital Watermark"]}],"abstract":"With the explosive growth of internet technology, many innovative applications requiring exchange of large amount of data have become feasible and hence security of data have become a critical issue.

For that reason, it is important to have a proper diagnosis of heart disease for patients to live to tell the tale. In order to make the diagnosis system as the efficient one, heart diseases should be classified accurately. In the existing technique, the quality of the extracted rules is poor. So as to increase the quality of the extracted rules, an efficient technique should be used. In our proposed methodology, we are using firefly algorithm in Fuzzy Min-Max Neural Network. Firefly algorithm has high convergence tempo. It works individually and finds a superior position for itself in contemplation with its recent position as well as the situation of other fireflies. And it escapes from the local optima and finds a global optimum which has a smaller amount number of iterations. Since it is a robust algorithm, the classification of heart diseases can be done fastly and as a result the accuracy and performance of the proposed technique becomes encouraging.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726611","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6715259/6726462/06726611.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On hybridizing fuzzy min max neural network and firefly algorithm for automated heart disease diagnosis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diseases","Heart","Classification algorithms","Conferences","Neural networks","Accuracy","IEEE conference proceedings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cardiology","diseases","fuzzy neural nets","medical computing","minimax techniques","patient diagnosis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy min max neural network","firefly algorithm","automated heart disease diagnosis","morbidity","mortality","patient diagnosis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Firefly Algorithm","Open Hyperbox","Rule Mining","Fuzzy Min-Max Neural Network (FMMN)","Heart Diseases","Classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726611/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"On hybridizing fuzzy min max neural network and firefly algorithm for automated heart disease diagnosis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6726611/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2013","accessionNumber":"14063311","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On hybridizing fuzzy min max neural network and firefly algorithm for automated heart disease diagnosis","confLoc":"Tiruchengode, India","sourcePdf":"336.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062434S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6715259","isNumber":"6726462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6715259","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6726462","articleId":"6726611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6726633,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Using the dynamic texture motion model, here the traffic is segmented into components of homogeneous motion. From each segmented region, a set of holistic low-level features are extracted using 4-level discrete wavelet transform. Using the 4 level discrete wavelet transform, I calculate the energy of wavelet coefficients and a function that map features into estimates of the number of vehicle per segment is learned with Bayesian regression. Here two Bayesian regression models are examined. The first is a Gaussian Process Regression with a compound kernel, which accounts for both the global and local trends of the count mapping but is limited by the real-valued outputs that do not match the discrete counts. I addressed this limitation with a second model which is based on a Bayesian treatment of poisson regression that introduces a prior distribution on the linear weights of the model. Experimental results show that regression-based counts are accurate regardless of the traffic size.

Firstly, every item is given a linguistic term so that each and every item can be monitored separately. Then each chromosome is classified as a whole. A new selection technique is proposed to maintain the diversity of the population. Crossover is done based on classification of chromosome. Justification of when to do single point and when to do multipoint crossover is given. A new Repair operator is proposed to make the infeasible solution feasible. The proposed algorithm does not stuck in the local maxima rather it explores the whole search space and new selection and crossover technique is used to ensure that.

The Fourth Generation (4G) wireless communication standards use new physical layer signaling techniques in their physical layer. Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) are the two major signaling techniques used in LTE. OFDMA is used in the downlink of the Fourth Generation (4G) wireless communication systems for its high spectral efficiency and SC-FDMA is used in the uplink of the Fourth Generation (4G) wireless communication systems for its high power efficiency. The main objective of this paper is to design and implement the reliable and energy efficient architecture for LTE uplink system using FPGA. IFDMA is the most energy efficient subcarrier mapping scheme of SC-FDMA multiple access scheme. In IFDMA, the data symbols subcarrier mapping is not one to one instead each subcarrier carries a part from each data symbol transmitted at that time instant. The reason for the selection of IFDMA subcarrier mapping along with SC-FDMA multiple access scheme for LTE uplink comes mainly from its advantage to provide a low peak to average power ratio (PAPR) for the transmitted waveform. This results in less power consumption in the mobile station during uplink transmission. The reliability of the system is improved using interleaving process by avoiding packet loss. Convolution codes are less complex and are used to provide error free transmission. The enhancement of energy efficiency is done using the convolution coded IFDMA. The chosen energy efficient architecture must be more power efficient and support high data rates, which is the main requirement for the mobile user.

Reducing power consumption has been an essential requirement for cloud environments not only to decrease operating cost but also improve the system reliability. The energy-aware computing is not just to make algorithms run as fast as possible, but also to minimize energy requirements for computation. Our DT-PALB (Double Threshold Energy Aware Load Balancing) algorithm maintains the state of all compute nodes, and based on utilization percentages, decides the number of compute nodes that should be operating. We show that our solution provides adequate availability to compute node resources while decreasing the overall power consumed by the local cloud as compared to using load balancing techniques that are power aware.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Double threshold energy aware load balancing in cloud computing","publicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726664","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6715259/6726462/06726664.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6726664","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726664/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Double threshold energy aware load balancing in cloud computing","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6726664/","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14063256","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Double threshold energy aware load balancing in cloud computing","confLoc":"Tiruchengode, India","sourcePdf":"416.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084223S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6715259","isNumber":"6726462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6715259","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6726462","articleId":"6726664","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6726665,"authors":[{"name":"Sumit Khurana","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, SURYA WORLD"],"firstName":"Sumit","lastName":"Khurana","id":"37086685641"},{"name":"Khyati Marwah","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, Baba Banda Singh Bahadur Engineering College"],"firstName":"Khyati","lastName":"Marwah","id":"37086687131"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3926-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3925-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6726665","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":962},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Computational modeling","Time factors","Virtual machining","Analytical models","Processor scheduling","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","quality of service","scheduling","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual machine scheduling policy","VM scheduling policy","distributed systems","cloud provisioning policy","cloud analyst simulator","cloud sim","cloud computing model","service demand variations","performance analysis","virtual environment","quality of service","QoS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Sim","Cloud Analyst","Scheduling Policies and Virtual Machine"]}],"abstract":"The concept Cloud computing has not only reshaped the field of distributed systems but also fundamentally changed how business potential extends today. In recent advancements, Cloud computing applications are provided as services to end-users. The application services hosted under Cloud computing model have complex provisioning, configuration, and deployment requirements How to use Cloud computing resources efficiently and gain the maximum profits with efficient utilization of resources is one of the Cloud computing service providers' ultimate goals. Repetitive evaluation of the performance of Cloud provisioning policies, application workload models, and resources performance models in dynamic system are difficult to achieve and rather a time consuming and costly approach. To overcome this challenge, Cloud analyst simulator based on Cloud Sim has been proposed which enables the modeling and simulation in cloud's ambience. The objective of this paper is to prove that the choice of VM Scheduling Policy in Cloud computing model significantly improves the application performance under resource and service demand variations.

For better Pulse Compression, peak signal to side lobe ratio i.e. Merit factor should be as high as possible so that the unwanted clutter gets suppressed. To achieve this, Phase Coded Pulse Compression sequences are widely used. The simple phase code is obtained from the Binary Pulse compression sequences but matched filtering of radar signals creates unwanted side lobes which may mask important information. The study of Poly Phase Pulse Compression sequences is carried out since these sequences have low side lobes and are better Doppler tolerant. When we move from Binary to Ternary and Ternary to Six Phase Pulse Compression VLSI systems, the memory requirements are increased, there by the area is increased and the real time implementation needs optimization of speed, area and power consumption. The paper concentrates on the design of an optimized model which can reduce these constraints. The proposed FPGA implementation can efficiently generate Six Phase Pulse Compression sequences while improving some of the parameters like area and speed when compared to previous methods. This module is implemented on FPGA as it provides the flexibility of re-configurability and reprograms ability.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6715259/6726462/06726706.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6726706","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation for generation of six phase pulse compression sequences","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiation detectors","Radar","Very large scale integration","Correlation","Field programmable gate arrays","Clocks","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary sequences","Doppler shift","field programmable gate arrays","phase coding","pulse compression","radar signal processing","radiofrequency integrated circuits","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","six phase pulse compression sequence generation","radar signal processing","peak signal to side lobe ratio","merit factor","phase code","binary pulse compression sequences","matched filtering","polyphase pulse compression sequences","Doppler tolerant","ternary-to-six phase pulse compression VLSI systems","binary-to-ternary phase pulse compression VLSI systems","power consumption","speed optimization","unwanted clutter suppression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pulse compression","Polyphase sequence","Merit Factor","VLSI architecture","FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726706/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation for generation of six phase pulse compression sequences","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6726706/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14063271","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation for generation of six phase pulse compression sequences","confLoc":"Tiruchengode, India","sourcePdf":"483.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036361S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6715259","isNumber":"6726462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6715259","xplore-issue":"6726462","articleId":"6726706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6726708,"authors":[{"name":"Neeraj Shrivastava","affiliation":["ABV-Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management, Gwalior, India"],"firstName":"Neeraj","lastName":"Shrivastava","id":"37947326900"},{"name":"Aditya Trivedi","affiliation":["ABV-Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management, Gwalior, India"],"firstName":"Aditya","lastName":"Trivedi","id":"37544703600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3926-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3925-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6726708","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","OFDM","MIMO","Bit error rate","Encoding","Receiving antennas","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","antenna arrays","array signal processing","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","quality of service","radio receivers","radio transmitters","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combined beamforming","space-time-frequency code","multiple-input multiple-output communication","MIMO-OFDM systems","multiple antennas","quality of service","4G broadband wireless communication systems","performance analysis","minimum mean squared error","MMSE","maximum likelihood detection","bit error rate","BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","MIMO","beamforming","space-time-frequency coding","broadband wireless communications"]}],"abstract":"Multiple antennas are used in wireless systems to achieve good quality of service and high data rate communication.

With the advent of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) assisted Multicarrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) systems, the above-mentioned three parameters may be simultaneously improved. The MC-CDMA combined with the MIMO technique, has become a core technology for future mobile radio communication system. However, possible potential gain in spectral efficiency is challenged by the receiver's ability to accurately detect the symbol due to inter symbol interference (ISI). Multipath propagation, mobility of transmitter, receiver and local scattering cause the signal to be spread in frequency, different arrival time and angle, which results in ISI in the received signal. This will affect overall system performance. The use of MC-CDMA mitigates the problem of time dispersion. However, still it is necessary to remove the amplitude and phase shift caused by channel. To solve this problem, a multiple antenna array can be used at the receiver, not only for spectral efficiency or gain enhancement, but also for interference suppression. This can be done by the beam forming, efficient channel estimation with strong equalization. This paper proposes MIMO MC-CDMA system with beamforming, Minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalization with ideal channel estimation. The simulation result shows improved BER performance when the sub carrier (SC) and antenna configuration was increased.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of the MIMO MC-CDMA system with beamforming","publicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726725","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6715259/6726462/06726725.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6726725","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726725/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Performance of the MIMO MC-CDMA system with beamforming","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6726725/","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14063243","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of the MIMO MC-CDMA system with beamforming","confLoc":"Tiruchengode, India","sourcePdf":"517.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110723S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6715259","isNumber":"6726462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6715259","xplore-issue":"6726462","articleId":"6726725","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6726736,"authors":[{"name":"J Vandhana","affiliation":["Electrical & Electronics Department, Amal Jyothi College of Engineering, Kerala, India"],"firstName":"J","lastName":"Vandhana","id":"37086644764"},{"name":"T Sreekumar","affiliation":["Electrical & Electronics Department, Amal Jyothi College of Engineering, Kerala, India"],"firstName":"T","lastName":"Sreekumar","id":"37086648950"},{"name":"Anish Benny","affiliation":["Electrical & Electronics Department, Amal Jyothi College of Engineering, Kerala, India"],"firstName":"Anish","lastName":"Benny","id":"37061204300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3926-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3925-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6726736","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6726736","abstract":"Neural Networks have made their mark in various fields of endeavor through their superior learning skills. In this paper, a Neural Network (NN) based reference model of a Brushless Direct Current Motor (BLDCM) has been developed in MATLAB/Simulink. During careful scrutiny, it was observed that the electromagnetic torque varies with the magnitude of the phase currents for motor operation between commutations and during commutation. Thus, constant torque production involves phase currents as the vital correction parameter. A novel torque control scheme through phase current control has been proposed in this work. The NNBLDCM has been employed to nullify the deviations in phase current waveforms at loaded condition of a real BLDCM through Neural Network based Current Injection Technique (NNCIT). The simulation results prove that the new technique improves the constant torque characteristic which, in turn, leads to an increase in the reliability of the BLDCM.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726736","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6715259/6726462/06726736.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel neural network based current injection technique for torque ripple reduction in BLDCM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Mathematical model","Artificial neural networks","Software packages","Load modeling","Brushless DC motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brushless DC motors","electric current control","machine control","neurocontrollers","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","current injection technique","torque ripple reduction","BLDCM","brushless direct current motor","electromagnetic torque","torque control","phase current control","phase current waveform","NNCIT"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Torque","Phase currents","Brushless Direct Current Motor (BLDCM)","Neural Network(NN)","MATLAB/Simulink"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726736/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"A novel neural network based current injection technique for torque ripple reduction in BLDCM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6726736/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2013","accessionNumber":"14063316","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel neural network based current injection technique for torque ripple reduction in BLDCM","confLoc":"Tiruchengode, India","sourcePdf":"531.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060395S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6715259","isNumber":"6726462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6715259","xplore-issue":"6726462","articleId":"6726736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6726740,"authors":[{"name":"Ankeeta R.

As MPSoCs are made up of hundreds of cores, Intercommunication requirements will not be feasible using a single shared bus or a hierarchy of buses due to their poor scalability with system size, and the different components are designed by various vendors, their shared bandwidth between all the attached cores and the energy efficiency requirements of final products. To overcome the above said problems of scalability and complexity, Networks-On-Chip (NoCs) have been proposed as a promising replacement to eliminate many of the overheads of buses and MPSoCs connected by means of general-purpose communication architectures. However, the development of application-specific NoCs for MPSoCs is a complex engineering process that involves the definition of suitable protocols and topologies of switches, and which demands adequate design flows to minimize design time and effort. In fact, the development of suitable high-level design and synthesis tools for NoC-based interconnects is a key element to benefit from NoC-based interconnects design in nanometer-scale CMOS technologies. This paper presents the design and implementation of FPGA based Network on chip (NoC) which is scalable packet switched architecture with advanced Networking functionalities such as store & forward transmission, error management, power management and security. All these features are built on basic NI core, which includes data packetization/depacketisation, frequency conversion, data size conversion and conversion of protocols with limited circuit complexity and cost.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6715259/6726462/06726748.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6726748","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network on chip design and implementation on FPGA with advanced hardware and networking functionalities","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Nickel","IP networks","Switches","Protocols","Security","Payloads"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","high level synthesis","logic design","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power management","data packetization/depacketisation","frequency conversion","data size conversion","protocol conversion","circuit complexity","error management","store & forward transmission","scalable packet switched architecture","FPGA based network on chip","nanometer-scale CMOS technologies","NoC-based interconnects design","high-level synthesis tools","high-level design","design time","design flows","application-specific NoC","general-purpose communication architectures","energy efficiency requirements","shared bandwidth","single shared bus","intercommunication requirements","network on chip design","FPGA implementation","hardware functionalities","networking functionalities","consumer embedded products","heterogeneous multiprocessor systems-on-chip","MPSoC","complex integrated components"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network-on-Chip (NoC)","Network-Interface (NI)","VLSI Architectures","Intellectual Property (IP)","Multi-Processor System-on-Chip (MPSoC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726748/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Network on chip design and implementation on FPGA with advanced hardware and networking functionalities","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6726748/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14063292","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network on chip design and implementation on FPGA with advanced hardware and networking functionalities","confLoc":"Tiruchengode, India","sourcePdf":"556.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065417S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6715259","isNumber":"6726462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6715259","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6726462","articleId":"6726748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6726755,"authors":[{"name":"R.

One well known technique to overcome this limitation is Automatic Query Expansion (AQE), whereby the user's original query is improved by adding new features with a related meaning. It has long been accepted that capturing term associations is a vital part of information retrieval. It is therefore mainly to consider whether many sources of support may be combined to forecast term relations more precisely. This is mainly significant when frustrating to predict the probability of relevance of a set of terms given a query, which may involve both lexical and semantic relations between the terms. This paper presents a approach to expand the user query using three level domain model such as conceptual level(underlying Domain knowledge), linguistic level(term vocabulary based on Wordnet), stochastic model ME-HMM2 which combines (HMM (Hidden Markov Model and Maximum Entropy(ME) models) stores the mapping between such levels, taking into account the linguistic context of words.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726755","publicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6715259/6726462/06726755.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An approach for semantic query expansion based on maximum entropy-hidden Markov model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6726755","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726755/","displayDocTitle":"An approach for semantic query expansion based on maximum entropy-hidden Markov model","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14068077","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6726755/","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An approach for semantic query expansion based on maximum entropy-hidden Markov model","confLoc":"Tiruchengode, India","sourcePdf":"565.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079239S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6715259","isNumber":"6726462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6715259","xplore-issue":"6726462","articleId":"6726755","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6726775,"authors":[{"name":"Apoorva Raikar","affiliation":["Dept of Computer Science and Engineering, KLS Gogte Institute of Technology, Belgaum, INDIA"],"firstName":"Apoorva","lastName":"Raikar","id":"37086775330"},{"name":"S.

As Dermoscopy is an in vivo method for the early diagnosis of malignant melanoma and the differential diagnosis of pigmented lesions of the skin, it has been shown to increase diagnostic accuracy over clinical visual inspection in the hands of experienced physicians.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6715259/6726462/06726775.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6726775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diagnosis of melanomas by check-list method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lesions","Malignant tumors","Image color analysis","Feature extraction","Skin","Accuracy","Image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancer","image colour analysis","image texture","medical image processing","object detection","skin","tumours"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["melanoma diagnosis","ELM 7 point checklist","image based system","automatic detection","melanoma detection","color parameter","texture parameter","lesion malignancy","dermoscopy","pigmented lesion","clinical visual inspection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Melanoma","Epiluminescence Microscopy","Dermoscopy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726775/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Diagnosis of melanomas by check-list method","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6726775/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14063343","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diagnosis of melanomas by check-list method","confLoc":"Tiruchengode, India","sourcePdf":"600.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071302S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6715259","isNumber":"6726462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6715259","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6726462","articleId":"6726775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6726797,"authors":[{"name":"Hitesh Garg","affiliation":["Dept. of CSE, PEC University of Technology, Chandigarh, UT, India"],"firstName":"Hitesh","lastName":"Garg","id":"37086708077"},{"name":"Alka Jindal","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Technology, PEC University of Technology, Chandigarh, UT, India"],"firstName":"Alka","lastName":"Jindal","id":"37968758400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3926-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3925-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6726797","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":370},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6726797","abstract":"The thyroid gland is highly vascular organ, and lies in the anterior part of the neck just below the thyroid cartilage. Ultrasound imaging is most commonly used to detect and classify abnormalities of the thyroid gland. Other modalities (CT/MRI) are also used. There is a challenge to segment ultrasound medical image which is often blurred and consists of noise as other modalities like CT contains ionizing radiations and expensive. Thus, there is a need to apply a method to automated segment well the objects for future analysis without any assumptions about the object's topology are made. Various methods or techniques are used for automatic segmention of thyroid gand but the application of neural network in image processing provides a better solution to segmentation problem. In this paper we use Feedforward neural network to classify the region using feature extraction and then segment it. Experiment and results are shown.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726797","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6715259/6726462/06726797.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segmentation of thyroid gland in ultrasound image using neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Image segmentation","Neural networks","Training","Histograms","Ultrasonic imaging","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","feature extraction","feedforward neural nets","image classification","image segmentation","medical image processing","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vascular organ","neck anterior part","thyroid cartilage","thyroid gland abnormalities detection","thyroid gland abnormalities classification","CT","MRI","ultrasound medical image segmentation","automated object segmentation","image processing","feedforward neural network","region classification","feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feed forward neural network","Feature extraction","Image processing","Thyroid segmentation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726797/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Segmentation of thyroid gland in ultrasound image using neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6726797/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2013","accessionNumber":"14063383","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmentation of thyroid gland in ultrasound image using neural network","confLoc":"Tiruchengode, India","sourcePdf":"647.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055496S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6715259","isNumber":"6726462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6715259","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6726462","articleId":"6726797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-30"},{"_id":6726813,"authors":[{"name":"Reenu Sara George","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, College of Engineering, Trivandrum, India"],"firstName":"Reenu Sara","lastName":"George","id":"37086764384"},{"name":"S Sabitha","affiliation":["Terna Public Charitable Trust's College of Engineering, Osmanabad, Maharashtra, IN"],"firstName":"S","lastName":"Sabitha"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3926-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3925-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6726813","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":432},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Cloud computing","Protocols","Data privacy","Encryption","Public key"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cryptographic protocols","data integrity","network computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data anonymization","cloud computing","data storage","remote cloud servers","remote data integrity checking protocols","encrypted text","plain text","encrypted data","Intel","VM","secure enclave","deanonymization","thin clients"]}],"abstract":"Data storage in cloud has become a recent topic of interest in technology. An increasing number of clients store their important data in remote cloud servers, without even leaving a copy in their local computers. Sometimes, the clients must ensure that their data is not lost or corrupted. A lot of works have been done on designing remote data integrity checking protocols to ensure the correctness of stored data. But all these methods check the integrity of encrypted text or plain text. An important issue that arises after encryption is the difficulty in performing computations on encrypted data. Instead of encryption, anonymization of data can be done as a means of preserving privacy. Data anonymization is the process of changing data that will be used or published in a way that prevents the identification of key information. Anonymized data can be stored in a cloud and processed without concern that other individuals may capture the data. Intel performed data anonymization in cloud where anonymization takes place on the VMs sending the data and de anaonymization within a secure enclave. But, anonymization at the clients may take more of their computational power which is not feasible, especially for thin clients. A better efficient data anonymization scheme is proposed where anonymization and deanonymization is performed by the secure enclave so that computational power at the client is saved. Also, a scheme to check the integrity of anonymized data in cloud has been explored.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726813","publicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6715259/6726462/06726813.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726462","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data anonymization and integrity checking in cloud computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6726813","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Data anonymization and integrity checking in cloud computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726813/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14063360","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6726813/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data anonymization and integrity checking in cloud computing","confLoc":"Tiruchengode, India","sourcePdf":"678.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067637S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6715259","isNumber":"6726462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6715259","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6726462","articleId":"6726813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6726814,"authors":[{"name":"Catherine Glenitta Figueiredo","affiliation":["Mtech Student dept. of Electronics and communication, Rajagiri school of engineering and technology, Kochi, India"],"firstName":"Catherine Glenitta","lastName":"Figueiredo","id":"37086757455"},{"name":"Tressa Michael","affiliation":["Assistant Professor dept. of Electronics and communication, Rajagiri school of engineering and technology, Kochi, India"],"firstName":"Tressa","lastName":"Michael","id":"37085338941"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3926-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3925-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6726814","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":343},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Discrete wavelet transforms","Feature extraction","Filtering","Noise","Heart"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","electrocardiography","field programmable gate arrays","medical signal processing","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI architecture","arrhythmia detection","FPGA implementation","VLSI based design","distributive arithmetic discrete wavelet transform","QRS complex","time variation","frequency variation","normal ECG waveform","ECG signal compression","MATLAB","MODELSIM software","DSP processor","ECG analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DA-DWT","ECG","FPGA","QRS complex"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a VLSI based design of high speed and area efficient distributive arithmetic discrete wavelet transform for arrhythmia detection and its FPGA implementation.

Knowledge base approach and Machine learning approach are the two strategies used for analyzing sentiments from the text. In this paper, we try to analyze the twitter posts about electronic products like mobiles, laptops etc using Machine Learning approach. By doing sentiment analysis in a specific domain, it is possible to identify the effect of domain information in sentiment classification. We present a new feature vector for classifying the tweets as positive, negative and extract peoples' opinion about products.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726818","pdfPath":"/iel7/6715259/6726462/06726818.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","publicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sentiment analysis in twitter using machine learning techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726818/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Sentiment analysis in twitter using machine learning techniques","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14063416","publicationDate":"July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6726818/","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sentiment analysis in twitter using machine learning techniques","confLoc":"Tiruchengode, India","sourcePdf":"683.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050061S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6715259","isNumber":"6726462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6715259","citationCount":"146","xplore-issue":"6726462","articleId":"6726818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6726821,"authors":[{"name":"Rajeswari","affiliation":["Acharya Institute of Technology, Bangalore, Karnataka, IN"],"lastName":"Rajeswari"},{"name":"N.

These high PAPR values result in serious degradation in performance when a non-linear power amplifier is employed. The Conventional Partial Transmit Sequence (C-PTS) technique is one of the highly efficient methods for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems. Unfortunately, the number of Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) operations employed in C-PTS technique is large and this adds to the computational complexity of the technique. In our proposed Hybrid technique, we have combined the C-PTS technique with interleaving and signal clipping method. The peaks of the OFDM signal are compressed by interleaving the data frame associated with it. All the extra IFFT operations that are required for C-PTS technique are avoided by our proposed method. Signal clipping and filtering result in reducing PAPR values even further. The simulation results show that our proposed hybrid technique achieves better reduction compared to the C-PTS technique at reduced computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726837","publicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6715259/6726462/06726837.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance improvement of OFDM using hybrid PAPR reduction technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6726837","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726837/","displayDocTitle":"Performance improvement of OFDM using hybrid PAPR reduction technique","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14063425","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6726837/","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance improvement of OFDM using hybrid PAPR reduction technique","confLoc":"Tiruchengode, India","sourcePdf":"715.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040195S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6715259","isNumber":"6726462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6715259","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6726462","articleId":"6726837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6726869,"authors":[{"name":"Ying-Dar Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Ying-Dar Lin is Professor of Computer Science at National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) in Taiwan.

However, such operations cannot be performed directly by conventional CPUs, because their instruction supports integers with fixed bits, say, 64 bits. Since the CPUs need to repeat arithmetic operations to numbers with fixed bits, they have considerably overhead to execute applications involving integer arithmetic with many bits. On the other hand, we can implement hardware algorithms for such applications in the FPGAs for further acceleration. However, the implementation of hardware algorithm is usually very complicated and debugging of hardware is too hard. The main contribution of this paper is to present an intermediate approach of software and hardware using FPGAs. More specifically, we present a processor based on FDFM (Few DSP slices and Few Memory blocks) approach that supports arithmetic operations with flexibly many bits, and implement it in the FPGA. Arithmetic instructions of our processor architecture include addition, subtraction, and multiplication for numbers with variable size longer than 64 bits. To show the potentiality of our processor, we have implemented 2048-bit RSA encryption/decryption by software written by machine instructions. The resulting processor uses only one DSP48E1 slices and four Block RAMs (BRAMs), and RSA encryption software on it runs in 635.65ms. It has been shown that the direct hardware implementation of RSA encryption runs in 277.26ms. Although our intermediate approach is slower, it has several advantages. Since the algorithm is written by software, the development and the debugging are easy. Also, it is more flexible and scalable.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726881/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14064059","htmlLink":"/document/6726881/","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Flexible-Length-Arithmetic Processor Using Embedded DSP Slices and Block RAMs in FPGAs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Flexible-Length-Arithmetic Processor Using Embedded DSP Slices and Block RAMs in FPGAs","confLoc":"Matsuyama, Japan","sourcePdf":"2795a075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087377S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6724093","isNumber":"6726858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6724093","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6726858","articleId":"6726881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6726884,"authors":[{"name":"Suguru Ochiai","affiliation":["Graduate School of Systems and Information Engineering, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Suguru","lastName":"Ochiai","id":"37086712130"},{"name":"Yoshiki Yamaguchi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Systems and Information Engineering, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshiki","lastName":"Yamaguchi","id":"37550163900"},{"name":"Yuetsu Kodama","affiliation":["Graduate School of Systems and Information Engineering, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuetsu","lastName":"Kodama","id":"37296682800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2796-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2795-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-1888"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-1896"}],"articleNumber":"6726884","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synthesizers","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Field programmable gate arrays","Instruments","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic music","field programmable gate arrays","mobile computing","musical instruments","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible sound synthesizer","FPGA","digital synthesizers","sound computing devices","spreading worldwide","mobile computing devices","higher-quality","higher-speed sound computation","mobile devices","programmability","internal modules","high quality basic modules","parallel computation","CORDIC methods","sound quality","circuit size","graphical user interface"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["music synthesizer","FPGA","mobile computing"]}],"abstract":"Digital synthesizers have laid the groundwork for the significant advances in sound computing devices and they have been spreading worldwide.

With an increasing number of overlapping sliding-windows, the window aggregates have a serious scalability issue, especially when it comes to implementing them in parallel processing hardware (e.g., FPGAs). To address the issue, we propose a resource-efficient, scalable, and order-agnostic hardware design and its implementation by examining and integrating two key concepts, called Window-ID and Pane, which are originally proposed for software implementation, respectively. Evaluation results show that the proposed implementation scales well compared to the previous FPGA implementation in terms of both resource consumption and performance. The proposed design is fully pipelined and our implementation can process out-of-order data items, or tuples, at wire speed up to 200 million tuples per second.","publicationTitle":"2013 First International Symposium on Computing and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 First International Symposium on Computing and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/6724093/6726858/06726885.pdf","startPage":"112","endPage":"121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient and Scalable Implementation of Sliding-Window Aggregate Operator on FPGA","doi":"10.1109/CANDAR.2013.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CANDAR.2013.23","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6726885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726885/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient and Scalable Implementation of Sliding-Window Aggregate Operator on FPGA","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14064140","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6726885/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient and Scalable Implementation of Sliding-Window Aggregate Operator on FPGA","confLoc":"Matsuyama, Japan","sourcePdf":"2795a112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080331S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6724093","isNumber":"6726858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6724093","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6726858","articleId":"6726885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":6726890,"authors":[{"name":"Mai Izawa","affiliation":["Dept of Information and Computer Science, Keio University, Hiyoshi, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Mai","lastName":"Izawa","id":"38242269400"},{"name":"Nobuaki Ozaki","affiliation":["Dept of Information and Computer Science, Keio University, Hiyoshi, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Nobuaki","lastName":"Ozaki","id":"38016347400"},{"name":"Yusuke Koizumi","affiliation":["Dept of Information and Computer Science, Keio University, Hiyoshi, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Koizumi","id":"38485561100"},{"name":"Rie Uno","affiliation":["Dept of Information and Computer Science, Keio University, Hiyoshi, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Rie","lastName":"Uno","id":"37070630100"},{"name":"Hideharu Amano","affiliation":["Dept of Information and Computer Science, Keio University, Hiyoshi, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideharu","lastName":"Amano","id":"37280731600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2796-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2795-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-1888"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-1896"}],"articleNumber":"6726890","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"abstract":"Cool Mega Array (CMA) is an energy efficient reconfigurable accelerator consisting of a large PE array with combinatorial circuits and a small microcontroller.

An efficient protocol considering primary user flows and channel assignment incurred network connectivity issue in the route selection is still missing. In this paper, we propose AODV-cog, a cognitive routing protocol for CSMA/CA ad hoc networks based on AODV.

In CR networks, CR users (CUs) are secondary users to the licensed spectrum and they are required to vacate the spectrum when a primary user (PU) reclaims it. We consider a general setting in which multiple PU interruptions may occur during the transmission period of CU traffic. Therefore, spectrum handoffs are provided to protect both the PU's and CU's transmission. In order to characterize the channel usage behaviors of primary traffic and CR real-time traffic with spectrum handoffs, we develop a queuing model which consists of preemptive resume priority M/G/1 and M/G/1/1 queues. Based on this queuing model, channel utilization factor can be derived. Besides, the blocking and forced termination probabilities for real-time traffic are also derived. Simulation results are given to validate the proposed analytical model.","doi":"10.1109/CANDAR.2013.74","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 First International Symposium on Computing and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/6724093/6726858/06726936.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CANDAR.2013.74","publicationTitle":"2013 First International Symposium on Computing and Networking","startPage":"415","endPage":"421","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Analysis of Spectrum Handoffs for Real-Time Traffic in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6726936","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Analysis of Spectrum Handoffs for Real-Time Traffic in Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726936/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6726936/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14064084","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Analysis of Spectrum Handoffs for Real-Time Traffic in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Matsuyama, Japan","sourcePdf":"2795a415.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082172S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6724093","isNumber":"6726858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6724093","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6726858","articleId":"6726936","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6726961,"authors":[{"name":"Akane Kawaharada","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical and Life Sciences, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Akane","lastName":"Kawaharada","id":"37085583021"},{"name":"Makoto Iima","affiliation":["Hiroshima Daigaku, Higashihiroshima, Hiroshima, JP"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Iima"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2796-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2795-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-1888"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-1896"}],"articleNumber":"6726961","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Equations","Stochastic processes","Automata","Data models","Boundary conditions","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular automata","diffusion","estimation theory","partial differential equations","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular automaton models","phenomena observation data","cellular automata rule estimation","statistic analysis","discretized diffusion equation","Burgers equation","deterministic models","stochastic models"]}],"abstract":"We propose a construction method of cellular automaton models based on observation data of phenomena.

It is commonly implemented as fundamental layer in software framework. However, RTOS inevitably causes extra overhead and latency to the system. One of the innovative approaches to improve the overhead and latency is to bring the RTOS out from software framework and implement as hardware component. For past decades, researches had proved that significant performance improvement can be achieved by implementing RTOS in hardware. However, these research outcomes failed to get wide acceptance in commercial products. We postulate that the lacking of interest in commercial community on hardware approached RTOS is due its high level of difficulty in adaptation process. Adapting hardware based RTOS in embedded system requires in depth knowledge on operating system as well as significant amount of manpower resources. This makes the hardware RTOS unpopular despite of the performance offered. This paper proposed a Simple and Effective hardware based Real-Time Operating System (SEOS) designed to provide high adaptability for ease of hardware RTOS adaptation, at the same time significantly improved the performance. Experimental result shows that SEOS has great performance advantages over software based RTOS.","doi":"10.1109/CANDAR.2013.110","publicationTitle":"2013 First International Symposium on Computing and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 First International Symposium on Computing and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/6724093/6726858/06726972.pdf","startPage":"612","endPage":"616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CANDAR.2013.110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SEOS: Hardware Implementation of Real-Time Operating System for Adaptability","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6726972","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726972/","displayDocTitle":"SEOS: Hardware Implementation of Real-Time Operating System for Adaptability","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14064068","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6726972/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SEOS: Hardware Implementation of Real-Time Operating System for Adaptability","confLoc":"Matsuyama, Japan","sourcePdf":"2795a612.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091422S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6724093","isNumber":"6726858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6724093","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6726858","articleId":"6726972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6726977,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Ling Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ming Chi University of Technology, New Taipei City, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"firstName":"Chun-Ling","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085392569"},{"name":"Sheng-Ta Hsieh","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Oriental Institute of Technology, New Taipei City, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"firstName":"Sheng-Ta","lastName":"Hsieh","id":"37305668300"},{"name":"You-Jhong Hu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Oriental Institute of Technology, New Taipei City, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"firstName":"You-Jhong","lastName":"Hu","id":"37086779001"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2796-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2795-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-1888"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-1896"}],"articleNumber":"6726977","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6726977","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Equations","Mathematical model","Influenza","Diseases","Expert systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","diseases","fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy set theory","medical expert systems","patient diagnosis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural network-based influenza diagnostic system","described symptoms","medical diagnostic aid expert system","fuzzy system","backpropagation neural network","BPNN","core engines","influenza diagnostic expert system","three systems","diagnostic reference","diagnostic error rates","early detections","doctor treatment","illnesses"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["back-propagation neural network","diagnostic","expert system","fuzzy theory","fuzzy neural network","Influenza"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CANDAR.2013.115","pdfPath":"/iel7/6724093/6726858/06726977.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 First International Symposium on Computing and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 First International Symposium on Computing and Networking","startPage":"633","endPage":"635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CANDAR.2013.115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy Neural Network-Based Influenza Diagnostic System","abstract":"As certain diseases are characterized by subjective perceptions of described symptoms, if symptoms are not obvious, physicians can easily mistake them for other illnesses.

Both local and semiglobal methods are relatively fast and feasible for parallel implementation. On the other hand, global GCS obtains a higher stereo matching accuracy but it is very computationally expensive. Thus, we propose a technique that guides SDPS using pre-computed Local-based BMS's result which both restricts and guides the Dynamic Programming search for optimal profile related to BMS's signals. The technique is not only parallel-able for a faster processing speed but also self-repeatable for an enhancement of the 3D reconstruction. Our experimental results show that this proposed technique is superior to the Global Graph Cuts Stereo (GCS) in both speed and accuracy. As well as reconstructing relatively accurate results from the infamous Middlebury datasets, this method is also demonstrated to be fast, robust, and reliable in reconstructing high quality 3D scenes from real-life stereo images.","doi":"10.1109/IVCNZ.2013.6726997","publicationTitle":"2013 28th International Conference on Image and Vision Computing New Zealand (IVCNZ 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 28th International Conference on Image and Vision Computing New Zealand (IVCNZ 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6710229/6726982/06726997.pdf","startPage":"88","endPage":"93","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVCNZ.2013.6726997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symmetric dynamic programming stereo using block matching guidance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6726997","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6726997/","displayDocTitle":"Symmetric dynamic programming stereo using block matching guidance","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14062311","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6726997/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symmetric dynamic programming stereo using block matching guidance","confLoc":"Wellington, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082794S","chronDate":"27-29 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6710229","isNumber":"6726982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6710229","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6726982","articleId":"6726997","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6727022,"authors":[{"name":"Arindam Bhakta","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, NEW ZEALAND"],"firstName":"Arindam","lastName":"Bhakta","id":"37086654174"},{"name":"Marcus Frean","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, NEW ZEALAND"],"firstName":"Marcus","lastName":"Frean","id":"37401690700"},{"name":"Christopher Hollitt","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, NEW ZEALAND"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Hollitt","id":"37682998600"},{"name":"Will N.

The ability to orient rapidly towards an important region in a scene allows an organism to accomplish activities, such as navigation, foraging and detecting possible prey/mates. Developing a computational model of visual attention has long been of interest as such models enable artificial systems to acquire information efficiently from complex and cluttered environments. Current computational models attend to an important region (usually one which is maximally different from its immediate neighbours) and then inhibits future viewing of that region in order to facilitate distribution of visual attention. In this work we introduce the idea of an `uncertainty map', which works in conjunction with the existing idea of `saliency map' to drive the system's attention. We demonstrate the distribution of visual attention by our model in simulation. We show that despite its simplicity, our system distributes visual attention in a context-dependent manner which can be easily tuned to different environments.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVCNZ.2013.6727022","publicationTitle":"2013 28th International Conference on Image and Vision Computing New Zealand (IVCNZ 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 28th International Conference on Image and Vision Computing New Zealand (IVCNZ 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6710229/6726982/06727022.pdf","startPage":"236","endPage":"241","doi":"10.1109/IVCNZ.2013.6727022","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trading off salience and uncertainty in sampling a visual scene","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Trading off salience and uncertainty in sampling a visual scene","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6727022/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14062332","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727022/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trading off salience and uncertainty in sampling a visual scene","confLoc":"Wellington, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"41.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051463S","chronDate":"27-29 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6710229","isNumber":"6726982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6710229","xplore-issue":"6726982","articleId":"6727022","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6727038,"authors":[{"name":"Wenlong Fu","affiliation":["School of Mathematics, Statistics and Operations Research"],"firstName":"Wenlong","lastName":"Fu","id":"37711659800"},{"name":"Mark Johnston","affiliation":["School of Mathematics, Statistics and Operations Research"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Johnston","id":"37671050900"},{"name":"Mengjie Zhang","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Mengjie","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37406631900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0883-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0882-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2151-2191"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-2205"}],"articleNumber":"6727038","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6727038","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Histograms","Approximation methods","Equations","Mathematical model","Information entropy","Entropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["entropy","Gaussian processes","image segmentation","mixture models","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian mixture models","information entropy","image segmentation","particle swarm optimisation","image analysis","GMM method","image histograms","PSO","fitness function"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IVCNZ.2013.6727038","pdfPath":"/iel7/6710229/6726982/06727038.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 28th International Conference on Image and Vision Computing New Zealand (IVCNZ 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 28th International Conference on Image and Vision Computing New Zealand (IVCNZ 2013)","startPage":"328","endPage":"333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVCNZ.2013.6727038","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gaussian mixture models and information entropy for image segmentation using particle swarm optimisation","abstract":"Image segmentation is a key step in image analysis. The Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) method based on image histograms is popular in image segmentation, but it is difficult to find good parameters of Gaussian models. A hybrid Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm has been used to effectively search the parameters of the models for image segmentation. However, the segmentation results from the fitted models are not stable. In this study, the parameters are optimised by developing a new fitness function in PSO based on information entropy. A combination of the entropy and goodness of the approximation on the image histogram is proposed as a new fitness function further. The results show that the fitness function combining the entropy and goodness of the approximation can be effectively used to obtain better segmentation results than only considering the goodness of the approximation on the image histogram, in terms of intensity errors and the information entropy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727038/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14062336","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6727038/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"27-29 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Gaussian mixture models and information entropy for image segmentation using particle swarm optimisation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gaussian mixture models and information entropy for image segmentation using particle swarm optimisation","confLoc":"Wellington, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"57.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063799S","chronDate":"27-29 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6710229","isNumber":"6726982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6710229","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6726982","articleId":"6727038","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6727045,"authors":[{"name":"Saeed Mirghasemi","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington"],"firstName":"Saeed","lastName":"Mirghasemi","id":"37398315200"},{"name":"Ramesh Rayudu","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington"],"firstName":"Ramesh","lastName":"Rayudu","id":"37298322000"},{"name":"Mengjie Zhang","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington"],"firstName":"Mengjie","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37406631900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0883-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0882-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2151-2191"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-2205"}],"articleNumber":"6727045","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":419},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6727045","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Particle swarm optimization","Object segmentation","Image color analysis","Clustering algorithms","Color","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation algorithm","modified seeded region growing","particle swarm optimization","seeded region growing algorithm","SRG algorithm","region growing strategy","multiseeded region growing problem","gray scale image segmentation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IVCNZ.2013.6727045","pdfPath":"/iel7/6710229/6726982/06727045.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 28th International Conference on Image and Vision Computing New Zealand (IVCNZ 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 28th International Conference on Image and Vision Computing New Zealand (IVCNZ 2013)","startPage":"382","endPage":"387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVCNZ.2013.6727045","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new image segmentation algorithm based on modified seeded region growing and particle swarm optimization","abstract":"Image Segmentation, a basic technique for many real world applications, has been considered in this paper.

We have previously used 3D surface deformation and tracking to identify mechanical properties of the skin. To be able to detect dynamic changes in the surface of the skin we need to have a real-time 3D measurement system. A significant portion of the computation time for tracking the changes is spent during 2D cross-correlation of surface images. This study focuses on improving cross-correlation speed by taking advantage of parallel computation in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). We have implemented variable size 2D cross-correlation computations using the Xilinx System Generator tool in the Virtex-6 LX240T FPGA. We have also proposed a hierarchical approach for finding the cross-correlation peak in order to efficiently use our method for different image sizes. Furthermore, the use of RAM blocks instead of shift registers in our design has lowered the resource requirements compared with other FPGA implementations. Preliminary results for our special design indicate better than 200 times speed up compared with a PC with an Intel Xeon E5620 CPU (2.4 GHz clock speed, 4 cores and 8 threads) and 12 GB DDR3 RAM and also 190 times speed up in comparison to an NVidia GForce GT 525M as the graphics processing unit (GPU).","doi":"10.1109/IVCNZ.2013.6727067","publicationTitle":"2013 28th International Conference on Image and Vision Computing New Zealand (IVCNZ 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 28th International Conference on Image and Vision Computing New Zealand (IVCNZ 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6710229/6726982/06727067.pdf","startPage":"352","endPage":"357","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVCNZ.2013.6727067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6726982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of 2D cross-correlation for real-time 3D tracking of deformable surfaces","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6727067","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727067/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of 2D cross-correlation for real-time 3D tracking of deformable surfaces","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14062313","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6727067/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of 2D cross-correlation for real-time 3D tracking of deformable surfaces","confLoc":"Wellington, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"61.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064885S","chronDate":"27-29 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6710229","isNumber":"6726982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6710229","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6726982","articleId":"6727067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6727086,"authors":[{"name":"K Anoh","affiliation":["Mobile and Satellite Communications Research Centre, University of Bradford, UK"],"firstName":"K","lastName":"Anoh","id":"37085435040"},{"name":"E Elkazmi","affiliation":["The higher institute of electronics, bani walid-libya"],"firstName":"E","lastName":"Elkazmi","id":"37085383664"},{"name":"R Abd-Alhameed","affiliation":["Mobile and Satellite Communications Research Centre, University of Bradford, UK"],"firstName":"R","lastName":"Abd-Alhameed","id":"37264895700"},{"name":"O Madubuko","affiliation":["Mobile and Satellite Communications Research Centre, University of Bradford, UK"],"firstName":"O","lastName":"Madubuko","id":"37086766637"},{"name":"M Bin-Melha","affiliation":["Mobile and Satellite Communications Research Centre, University of Bradford, UK"],"firstName":"M","lastName":"Bin-Melha","id":"38272456700"},{"name":"S Jones","affiliation":["Mobile and Satellite Communications Research Centre, University of Bradford, UK"],"firstName":"S","lastName":"Jones","id":"37529427000"},{"name":"T.

The results show that as technology scales down (i.e., from 90nm to 65nm, and 45nm), BTI impact on sensing delay increases, while that on the sensing voltage decreases, causing the sense amplifier memory, hence to be less robust and reliable.

The result show that increasing the power supply can reduce the sense amplifier BTI degradadtion with 33% for sensing voltage and with 18% for sensing delay; leading to clear tradeoff engineering question between power and robustness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727094/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6727094/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14063927","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"BTI impact on SRAM sense amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BTI impact on SRAM sense amplifier","confLoc":"Marrakesh, Morocco","sourcePdf":"6B3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060886S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6717187","isNumber":"6727071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6717187","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6727071","articleId":"6727094","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6727097,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Applications need to be multi-threaded to benefit from the concurrency provided by the MPSoC. Many parallel versions of the new emerging H.264/AVC [1] already exist. However, providing a full parallel H.264 version is blocked by the fact that all parts of the decoder depend on the first sequential stage of the decoding process which is the entropy decoder (mainly CAVLC). The entropy decoder consumes about 30% [8] of the total time of the decoder. In this work, we propose an optimized FPGA design achieving the demands of multi-threaded H.264 decoder versions which can be integrated in an MPSoC. We focus in our work on time optimization and on cycle number decrease when decoding an encoded 4\u00d74 block of pixels. We also aim to achieve a design that operates at high frequencies. The work leads to the ability to decode at least 62 frames per second for HD resolution 1280\u00d7720. Decoding takes 22 clock cycles for one block of 4\u00d74 pixels at most. The design has an upper frequency limit of 247MHz.

In addition, Aging failures - such as Bias Temperature Instability (BTI)-may worsen the situation and accelerate the degradation (i.e. increase the delay) and cause sooner field failures. This paper investigates the impact of partial opens and BTI in SRAM address decoders first separately and thereafter in a combined manner. Simulation results show that BTI impact strongly depends on the selected worldline, transistor location and addressing scheme; and it cause up to 14.27% additional delay. In addition, they show that partial opens, which do not cause hard faults and allow memory operations to pass correctly, contribute up to 23.65% additional delay. Combining these failure mechanisms reveals that the degradation can strongly be worsened and accelerate wear-out; an additional delay of up to 31.20% can be caused. This indicates the importance of incorporating appropriate design-for-reliability/testability schemes in order to guarantee the required lifetime of the memory system.","doi":"10.1109/IDT.2013.6727124","publicationTitle":"2013 8th IEEE Design and Test Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 8th IEEE Design and Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel7/6717187/6727071/06727124.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IDT.2013.6727124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6727071","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6727124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of partial resistive defects and Bias Temperature Instability on SRAM decoder reliablity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727124/","displayDocTitle":"Impact of partial resistive defects and Bias Temperature Instability on SRAM decoder reliablity","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6727124/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14063900","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of partial resistive defects and Bias Temperature Instability on SRAM decoder reliablity","confLoc":"Marrakesh, Morocco","sourcePdf":"idt1243.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072752S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6717187","isNumber":"6727071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6717187","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6727071","articleId":"6727124","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6727125,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Neggazi","affiliation":["Ecole Nationale Polytechniques, Signal and Communications Laboratory, Elharrach, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Neggazi","id":"38474974100"},{"name":"Latifa Hamami","affiliation":["Ecole Nationale Polytechniques, Signal and Communications Laboratory, Elharrach, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Latifa","lastName":"Hamami","id":"37397766100"},{"name":"Abbes Amira","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, University of Ulster, Newtownabbey, UK"],"firstName":"Abbes","lastName":"Amira","id":"37270846500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3525-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-0601"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-061X"}],"articleNumber":"6727125","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"abstract":"In this paper, an energy aware real-time wireless fall detection system based on the multi-scale analysis is proposed. Furthermore, an efficient feature extraction and compression algorithm for high accuracy fall recognition is presented. The proposed algorithm is carried out on the low-power Shimmer sensing platform. The developed method aims to reduce the amount of 3D acceleration data for energy efficiency improvement of the energy-hungry wireless links. Interestingly, our results show an average power consumption of less than 60% on the Shimmer Bluetooth link. In addition, the average of the 3D acceleration data rate savings is about 87.5%. Moreover, the proposed energy-aware fall detection system has been proven to distinguish among falls and activities of daily living, and the accuracy has been evaluated in terms of specificity and sensitivity and has shown excellent results. The sparsity degree for an efficient representation of 3D acceleration signal and high fall detection accuracy rate is also studied. The percent error between the original and reconstruted 3D acceleration signal of 7% after applying compressive sensing would yield a space savings of 56%, for a sparsity S=77 and signal length N=512.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 8th IEEE Design and Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel7/6717187/6727071/06727125.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","publicationTitle":"2013 8th IEEE Design and Test Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IDT.2013.6727125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IDT.2013.6727125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6727071","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6727125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-scale analysis and compressive sensing based energy aware fall detection system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Three-dimensional displays","Wireless sensor networks","Discrete wavelet transforms","Wireless communication","Sensors","Compressed sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acceleration measurement","compressed sensing","patient monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D acceleration data","low-power Shimmer sensing platform","high accuracy fall recognition","energy aware real-time wireless fall detection system","compressive sensing","multiscale analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Real-time ambulatory 3D acceleration monitoring","Fall detection","DWT","compressive sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A multi-scale analysis and compressive sensing based energy aware fall detection system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6727125/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14068082","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-scale analysis and compressive sensing based energy aware fall detection system","confLoc":"Marrakesh, Morocco","sourcePdf":"idt1246.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067756S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6717187","isNumber":"6727071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6717187","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6727071","articleId":"6727125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6727127,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Di Carlo","affiliation":["Politecnico di Torino, Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Di Carlo","id":"37296346000"},{"name":"Giulio Gambardella","affiliation":["Politecnico di Torino, Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Giulio","lastName":"Gambardella","id":"38232244200"},{"name":"Piergiorgio Lanza","affiliation":["Thales Alenia Space Italia S.p.a., Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Piergiorgio","lastName":"Lanza","id":"38132281500"},{"name":"Paolo Prinetto","affiliation":["Politecnico di Torino, Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Prinetto","id":"37323155800"},{"name":"Daniele Rolfo","affiliation":["Politecnico di Torino, Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Rolfo","id":"38234873700"},{"name":"Pascal Trotta","affiliation":["Politecnico di Torino, Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Trotta","id":"38528022400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3525-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-0601"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-061X"}],"articleNumber":"6727127","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Histograms","Calculators","Computer architecture","Field programmable gate arrays","Equalizers","Clocks","Image enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft navigation","entry, descent and landing (spacecraft)","feature extraction","field programmable gate arrays","image enhancement","space vehicle electronics","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SAFE FPGA-based IP-core","self-adaptive frame enhancer","real-time space application","video-based navigation algorithm","FPGA hardware acceleration","image feature correlation","image feature extrapolation","image enhancement","high-precision feature extraction","FPGA-based self-adaptive image enhancer","hard-real time application"]}],"abstract":"Video-based navigation is an increasingly used procedure with hard real-time requirements and high computational effort.

Poly-phase decomposition scheme offers multiplexing of filter bank computations or/and reduce the data clocking without affecting the overall throughput rate. Both these features can be used conveniently depending on resources availability or processor-technology. Time-multiplexing could be the choice for resource-constrained applications. Slower clocking rate could be chosen if processor-technology is the constraint. In that case, the design could be realized with cheaper and slower processor-technology. Time-multiplexed design needs proper data scheduling to perform filter bank computation interleavingly without data overlapping. Keeping this in mind, we have derived a systolic architecture for hardware realization of time-multiplexed filter bank where we have used novel data buffering scheme for the filter coefficients of the filter bank. Comparison result show that, the proposed structure involves almost J times less hardware resource than the non poly-phase filter bank structure and it provides the same throughput rate as the other, where J is the filter bank size. The hardware saving is significant for large size filter banks like Gabor. The proposed structure could be a good candidate for efficient hardware implementation of non-separable filter bank used in various image processing applications such as biometrics systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 8th IEEE Design and Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel7/6717187/6727071/06727130.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2013 8th IEEE Design and Test Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IDT.2013.6727130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IDT.2013.6727130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6727071","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6727130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systolic architecture for hardware implementation of two-dimensional non-separable filter-bank","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filters","Hardware","Registers","Clocks","Delays","Computer architecture","Multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","Gabor filters","logic design","parallel algorithms","systolic arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics systems","image processing applications","filter coefficients","data buffering scheme","data scheduling","clocking rate","resource constrained applications","time multiplexing","data clocking","polyphase decomposition scheme","two dimensional nonseparable filter bank","hardware implementation","systolic architecture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727130/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Systolic architecture for hardware implementation of two-dimensional non-separable filter-bank","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6727130/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14126501","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systolic architecture for hardware implementation of two-dimensional non-separable filter-bank","confLoc":"Marrakesh, Morocco","sourcePdf":"idt1252.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080235S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6717187","isNumber":"6727071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6717187","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6727071","articleId":"6727130","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6727133,"authors":[{"name":"Pranab Roy","affiliation":["School of VLSI Technology, Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, INDIA"],"firstName":"Pranab","lastName":"Roy","id":"37958578500"},{"name":"Mahua Raha Patra","affiliation":["School of VLSI Technology, Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, INDIA"],"firstName":"Mahua Raha","lastName":"Patra","id":"38547357000"},{"name":"Hafizur Rahaman","affiliation":["School of VLSI Technology, Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, INDIA"],"firstName":"Hafizur","lastName":"Rahaman","id":"37284440200"},{"name":"Parthasarathi Dasgupta","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, INDIA"],"firstName":"Parthasarathi","lastName":"Dasgupta","id":"37288667500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3525-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-0601"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-061X"}],"articleNumber":"6727133","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Table lookup","Microfluidics","Biomedical optical imaging","Optical sensors","Registers","Protocols","Photodiodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electronics","bioMEMS","blood","lab-on-a-chip","microfluidics","network synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital detection analysis","intelligent detection","digital microfluidic biochip analysis","lab-on-chip device","time-multiplexed reconfigurable device","multiple bioassay protocols","single 2D planar array","circuit designs","automated detailed analysis","optical detection","biochip operation","homogeneous droplet samples","heterogeneous droplet samples","dual mode operation","human blood samples"]}],"abstract":"A second generation lab-on-chip device termed as digital microfluidic biochip is developed as a time-multiplexed reconfigurable device capable of executing multiple bioassay protocols simultaneously on a single 2D planar array.

The two types of analyzers enable automated detailed analysis of the optical detection results based on the data acquired at the detection site through successful Biochip operation for a) homogeneous droplet samples and b) heterogeneous droplet samples. A third circuit that integrates the previous two designs for dual mode operation is also proposed.

When the channel is modeled using Rayleigh multipath fading, AWGN and ISI both techniques yield similar performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727136/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6727136/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14063889","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Performance of different wavelet families using DWT and DWPT-channel equalization using ZF and MMSE","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of different wavelet families using DWT and DWPT-channel equalization using ZF and MMSE","confLoc":"Marrakesh, Morocco","sourcePdf":"idt1264.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054694S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6717187","isNumber":"6727071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6717187","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6727071","articleId":"6727136","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6727141,"authors":[{"name":"Yasmin Halawani","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Khalifa University, Abu-Dhabi, United Arab Emirates"],"firstName":"Yasmin","lastName":"Halawani","id":"37085544769"},{"name":"Baker Mohammad","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Khalifa University, Abu-Dhabi, United Arab Emirates"],"firstName":"Baker","lastName":"Mohammad","id":"37574033300"},{"name":"Dirar Humouz","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Khalifa University, Abu-Dhabi, United Arab Emirates"],"firstName":"Dirar","lastName":"Humouz","id":"37086674840"},{"name":"Mahmoud Al-Qutayri","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Khalifa University, Abu-Dhabi, United Arab Emirates"],"firstName":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Al-Qutayri","id":"37266039000"},{"name":"Hani Saleh","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Khalifa University, Abu-Dhabi, United Arab Emirates"],"firstName":"Hani","lastName":"Saleh","id":"37391220900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3525-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-0601"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-061X"}],"articleNumber":"6727141","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Memristors","Random access memory","Nonvolatile memory","Memory management","Power demand","System-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data acquisition","environmental factors","memristors","power consumption","random-access storage","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["leakage power","nonvolatility features","communication channels","energy source","energy consumption","computational energy","battery-powered device","power management","monitoring device","data acquisition","environmental parameters","physical parameters","WSN","wireless sensor node","memristor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power Management","sensor nodes","non-volatile memories","low power","system level"]}],"abstract":"Wireless sensor nodes (WSN) are used extensively to monitor a wide range of physical and environmental parameters. Data acquisition, processing, storage and transmission are mandatory requirements for different applications. These nodes are expected to generate a correct representation of the sensed quantities, which is then used to make various decisions and control actions. This means that the node requires more memory capabilities to store data either temporary or permanently. The collected data can then be used. As the monitoring device of WSN is increasingly mobile, the need for efficient power management (PM) techniques is becoming crucial in order to extend the lifetime of the battery-powered device. Energy is a critical performance metric in WSNs. Challenges facing WSN designers range from computational energy, energy consumption, energy source, communication channels, etc. A new emerging memory technology like memristor provides a good candidate for WSN PM. Memristor non-volatility features coupled with small size and low energy operation provide a normally-off instant-on mode of operation for the WSN; this will minimize the loss of energy to leakage power. The paper gives an insight about using memristor in a PM scheme at the system level.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memristor for energy efficient wireless sensor node","doi":"10.1109/IDT.2013.6727141","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IDT.2013.6727141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6727071","publicationTitle":"2013 8th IEEE Design and Test Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 8th IEEE Design and Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel7/6717187/6727071/06727141.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6727141","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727141/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Memristor for energy efficient wireless sensor node","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6727141/","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14126497","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memristor for energy efficient wireless sensor node","confLoc":"Marrakesh, Morocco","sourcePdf":"IP10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089784S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6717187","isNumber":"6727071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6717187","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6727071","articleId":"6727141","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6727142,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Unfortunately, standard AFM imaging requires a timescale on the order of seconds to minutes to acquire an image which makes it complicated to observe dynamic processes. Moreover, it is often required to take several images before a relevant observation region is identified. In this paper we show how to significantly reduce the image acquisition time by under sampling. The reconstruction of an under sampled AFM image can be viewed as an in painting, interpolating problem, or a special case of compressed sensing. We argue that the preferred approach depends upon the type of image. Of the methods proposed for AFM, images containing high frequencies should be reconstructed using basis pursuit from data collected in a spiral pattern. Images without too much high frequency content should be reconstructed using interpolation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6727149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SITIS.2013.32","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Signal-Image Technology & Internet-Based Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Signal-Image Technology & Internet-Based Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6724378/6727149/06727181.pdf","startPage":"130","endPage":"135","doi":"10.1109/SITIS.2013.32","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction of Undersampled Atomic Force Microscopy Images: Interpolation versus Basis Pursuit","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction of Undersampled Atomic Force Microscopy Images: Interpolation versus Basis Pursuit","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6727181/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14064361","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727181/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction of Undersampled Atomic Force Microscopy Images: Interpolation versus Basis Pursuit","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"3211a130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091163S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6724378","isNumber":"6727149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6724378","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6727149","articleId":"6727181","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6727190,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Ge","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Ge","id":"38522120300"},{"name":"Ju Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Ju","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279467700"},{"name":"Chuan Ge","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Chuan","lastName":"Ge","id":"37070476900"},{"name":"Xiaohui Yang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohui","lastName":"Yang","id":"37534298300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3211-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6727190","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"abstract":"This paper has proposed an improved video super-resolution algorithm to reconstruct high quality pictures in a low resolution video sequence from existing high resolution key frames.

Further research can prove that this simplified EM algorithm achieves robust classification of unrestricted image domain.","doi":"10.1109/SITIS.2013.172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SITIS.2013.172","startPage":"1071","endPage":"1076","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Signal-Image Technology & Internet-Based Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6724378/6727149/06727322.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Signal-Image Technology & Internet-Based Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6727149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple Example: Clustering Images Using Expectation Maximization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Simple Example: Clustering Images Using Expectation Maximization","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6727322/","accessionNumber":"14064362","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727322/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple Example: Clustering Images Using Expectation Maximization","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"3211b071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05956S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6724378","isNumber":"6727149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6724378","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6727149","articleId":"6727322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6727390,"authors":[{"name":"Rubing Duan","affiliation":["A*STAR, Institute of High Performance Computing, Singapore"],"firstName":"Rubing","lastName":"Duan","id":"37301850800"},{"name":"Radu Prodan","affiliation":["University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria"],"firstName":"Radu","lastName":"Prodan","id":"37299754000"},{"name":"Xiaorong Li","affiliation":["A*STAR, Institute of High Performance Computing, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xiaorong","lastName":"Li","id":"37293183500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-7161"},{"format":"CD","value":"2372-0018"}],"articleNumber":"6727390","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":72,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2212},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/portal/web/guest/home"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ces/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee-pes.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","url":"computer.org/tcc"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Objective Game Theoretic Schedulingof Bag-of-Tasks Workflows on Hybrid Clouds","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6727390","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Game theory","Processor scheduling","Scheduling","Bandwidth allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","game theory","parallel processing","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective game theoretic scheduling problem","bag-of-tasks workflows","hybrid clouds","heterogeneous computing systems","fundamental NP-complete problem","QoS requirements","sequential cooperative game","storage-aware multi objective algorithm","large scale parallel workflow applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-objective scheduling","game theory","bags-of-tasks","hybrid clouds"]}],"abstract":"Scheduling multiple large-scale parallel workflow applications on heterogeneous computing systems like hybrid clouds is a fundamental NP-complete problem that is critical to meeting various types of QoS (Quality of Service) requirements.

With the increasing popularity of digital slide scanners, decision support systems based on the analysis of digital pathology images are in high demand. However, computerized decision support systems are fraught with problems that stem from color variations in tissue appearance due to variation in tissue preparation, variation in stain reactivity from different manufacturers/batches, user or protocol variation, and the use of scanners from different manufacturers. In this paper, we present a novel approach to stain normalization in histopathology images. The method is based on nonlinear mapping of a source image to a target image using a representation derived from color deconvolution. Color deconvolution is a method to obtain stain concentration values when the stain matrix, describing how the color is affected by the stain concentration, is given. Rather than relying on standard stain matrices, which may be inappropriate for a given image, we propose the use of a color-based classifier that incorporates a novel stain color descriptor to calculate image-specific stain matrix. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed stain matrix estimation and stain normalization methods, they are applied to the problem of tumor segmentation in breast histopathology images. The experimental results suggest that the paradigm of color normalization, as a preprocessing step, can significantly help histological image analysis algorithms to demonstrate stable performance which is insensitive to imaging conditions in general and scanner variations in particular.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727397/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","volume":"61","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14300723","pubMedId":"24845283","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2014","publicationDate":"June 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6727397/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Nonlinear Mapping Approach to Stain Normalization in Digital Histopathology Images Using Image-Specific Color Deconvolution","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Nonlinear Mapping Approach to Stain Normalization in Digital Histopathology Images Using Image-Specific Color Deconvolution","sourcePdf":"tbme-khan-2303294-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129803S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6815992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"266","xplore-issue":"6815992","articleId":"6727397","onlineDate":"28 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6727398,"authors":[{"name":"Joan Enric Barcel\u00f3-Llad\u00f3","affiliation":["Telecommunications and Systems Engineering Department, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Cerdanyola del Valles, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Joan Enric Barcel\u00f3-Llad\u00f3 received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree from Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona (UAB), Spain, in 2007 and 2012, respectively.","In 2007, he was a Research Assistant with Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Siena, Italy, involved in cross-layer techniques for satellite networks.

The goal is twofold. First, to take advantage of the time correlation in order to produce sparse versions of the signal vector, which collects the transmitted signals of all the sensors. Second, to benefit from the nature of the multiple access channel in order to perform random measurements of the signal vector. Additionally, a simple model that accurately approximates the distortion introduced by the proposed scheme is presented. This model is then used to select the number of active nodes and relays based on a cost function that controls the tradeoff between reconstruction error and energy consumption. Simulation results show that the AF-CS outperforms other techniques in terms of distortion and number of transmissions, providing simultaneously, energy savings and a significant reduction in the number of channel uses.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2014.2303080","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/6766215/06727398.pdf","startPage":"1710","endPage":"1719","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2014.2303080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6766215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplify-and-Forward Compressed Sensing as an Energy-Efficient Solution in Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6727398","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727398/","displayDocTitle":"Amplify-and-Forward Compressed Sensing as an Energy-Efficient Solution in Wireless Sensor Networks","volume":"14","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14195354","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6727398/","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplify-and-Forward Compressed Sensing as an Energy-Efficient Solution in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"jsen-barcelollado-2303080-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128248S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6766215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6766215","articleId":"6727398","onlineDate":"28 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6727399,"authors":[{"name":"Kostas Margellos","affiliation":["Automatic Control Laboratory, Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Kostas","lastName":"Margellos","id":"37403362500"},{"name":"Paul Goulart","affiliation":["Automatic Control Laboratory, Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Goulart","id":"37299725600"},{"name":"John Lygeros","affiliation":["Automatic Control Laboratory, Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Lygeros","id":"37301174800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"6727399","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":122,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2937},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Robustness","Optimization","Nickel","Probabilistic logic","Standards","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constraint handling","optimisation","randomised algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chance constrained optimization problems","robust optimization","scenario-based methods","uncertainty bounds","scenario approach","robust problem","constraint functions","tractability","randomized algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chance constrained optimization","randomized algorithms","robust optimization","scenario approach"]},{"kwd":["Chance constrained optimization","randomized algorithms","robust optimization","scenario approach"]}],"abstract":"We propose a new method for solving chance constrained optimization problems that lies between robust optimization and scenario-based methods.

The analysis combines a recent formulation of the Purcell effect in semiconductor nanolasers with finite-element modeling and established theoretical models for temperature-dependent emission spectra. While the method is general, we apply it to a subwavelength metallo-dielectric nanolaser, and find that \u03b2 of the dominant mode decreases sharply below a transition temperature. This result is found for both positive and negative thermo-optic coefficients of the semiconductor material, and occurs because of detuning between the dominant mode and peak emission. The analysis enables better understanding of nanolaser dynamics, as well as the design and characterization of high-\u03b2 nanolasers.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/3/6709814/06727400.pdf","startPage":"175","endPage":"185","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JQE.2014.2303075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.2014.2303075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6709814","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6727400","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temperature Dependence of the Spontaneous Emission Factor in Subwavelength Semiconductor Lasers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature dependence","Cavity resonators","Spontaneous emission","Laser modes","Temperature","Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","laser tuning","nanophotonics","quantum well lasers","spontaneous emission","thermo-optical effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-\u03b2 nanolasers","nanolaser dynamics","semiconductor material","negative thermo-optic coefficients","positive thermo-optic coefficients","transition temperature","subwavelength metallo-dielectric nanolaser","temperature-dependent emission spectra","theoretical model","finite-element modeling","semiconductor nanolasers","Purcell effect","subwavelength semiconductor lasers","spontaneous emission factor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Indium gallium arsenide phosphide","laser modes","nanoscale devices","nanophotonics","photoluminescence","quantum well lasers","semiconductor lasers","spontaneous emission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727400/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Temperature Dependence of the Spontaneous Emission Factor in Subwavelength Semiconductor Lasers","volume":"50","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6727400/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14083522","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temperature Dependence of the Spontaneous Emission Factor in Subwavelength Semiconductor Lasers","sourcePdf":"jqe-smalley-2303075-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096286S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"3","isNumber":"6709814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6709814","articleId":"6727400","onlineDate":"28 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6727403,"authors":[{"name":"Kamal Al Nasr","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tennessee State University, Nashville, TN"],"firstName":"Kamal","lastName":"Al Nasr","id":"37086625248"},{"name":"Desh Ranjan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA"],"firstName":"Desh","lastName":"Ranjan","id":"37325840700"},{"name":"Mohammad Zubair","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Zubair","id":"37282842200"},{"name":"Lin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Chen","id":"38240407300"},{"name":"Jing He","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"He","id":"37674867500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-5963"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9964"},{"format":"CD","value":"2374-0043"}],"articleNumber":"6727403","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":265},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"The Association for Computing Machinery","url":"http://www.acm.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-nns.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://computer.org/"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"","type":"graphic","fileSize":"45KB","file":"/ielx7/8857/6819503/6727403/graphical_abstract/tcbb-gagraphic-2302803.jpg","coverImage":""},"abstract":"Electron cryomicroscopy is becoming a major experimental technique in solving the structures of large molecular assemblies.

At this resolution range, major \u03b1-helices can be detected as cylindrical sticks and \u03b2-sheets can be detected as plain-like regions.

Our method, DP-TOSS, has been tested using \u03b1-proteins with maximum 33 helices and \u03b1-\u03b2 proteins up to five helices and 12 \u03b2-strands. The correct match was ranked within the top 35 for 19 of the 20 \u03b1-proteins and all nine \u03b1-\u03b2 proteins tested.

This is a major concern since modern control systems are becoming large and decentralized and thus more vulnerable to attacks. This paper is concerned with the estimation and control of linear systems when some of the sensors or actuators are corrupted by an attacker. We give a new simple characterization of the maximum number of attacks that can be detected and corrected as a function of the pair (A,C) of the system and we show in particular that it is impossible to accurately reconstruct the state of a system if more than half the sensors are attacked. In addition, we show how the design of a secure local control loop can improve the resilience of the system. When the number of attacks is smaller than a threshold, we propose an efficient algorithm inspired from techniques in compressed sensing to estimate the state of the plant despite attacks. We give a theoretical characterization of the performance of this algorithm and we show on numerical simulations that the method is promising and allows to reconstruct the state accurately despite attacks. Finally, we consider the problem of designing output-feedback controllers that stabilize the system despite sensor attacks. We show that a principle of separation between estimation and control holds and that the design of resilient output feedback controllers can be reduced to the design of resilient state estimators.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2014.2303233","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/9/6819104/06727407.pdf","startPage":"1454","endPage":"1467","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6819104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2014.2303233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Estimation and Control for Cyber-Physical Systems Under Adversarial Attacks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6727407","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","displayDocTitle":"Secure Estimation and Control for Cyber-Physical Systems Under Adversarial Attacks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727407/","publicationDate":"June 2014","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14318965","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6727407/","volume":"59","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1136174"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Estimation and Control for Cyber-Physical Systems Under Adversarial Attacks","sourcePdf":"tac-fawzi-2303233-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131096S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6819104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"628","xplore-issue":"6819104","articleId":"6727407","onlineDate":"28 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6727414,"authors":[{"name":"Lara Bri\u00f1\u00f3n-Arranz","affiliation":["Laboratory of Robotics and Systems in Engineering and Science (LARSyS), Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico (IST), University of Lisbon, Portugal"],"firstName":"Lara","lastName":"Bri\u00f1\u00f3n-Arranz","id":"37085812007"},{"name":"Alexandre Seuret","affiliation":["CNRS, LAAS, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Seuret","id":"37298882600"},{"name":"Carlos Canudas-de-Wit","affiliation":["CNRS, GIPSA-lab, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Canudas-de-Wit","id":"38274215000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"6727414","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":145,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2835},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Vectors","Control design","Multi-agent systems","Tracking","Time-varying systems","Vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","mobile robots","motion control","multi-robot systems","nonlinear control systems","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative control design","time-varying formations","nonlinear multiagent systems","time-varying parameters","translation control design","circular motion tracking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Autonomous multi-agent systems","Cooperative control","Formation control","Communication constraints"]},{"kwd":["Autonomous multi-agent systems","communication constraints","cooperative control","formation control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6727414","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2014.2303213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2014.2303213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6861468","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/9/6861468/06727414.pdf","startPage":"2283","endPage":"2288","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Control Design for Time-Varying Formations of Multi-Agent Systems","abstract":"This paper deals with cooperative control design for nonlinear multi-agent systems.

MDM systems must typically use MIMO frequency-domain equalization (FDE) to minimize computational complexity, in contrast to polarization-division-multiplexed systems in single-mode fiber, where time-domain equalization (TDE) has low complexity and is often employed to compensate for polarization effects. We study two adaptive algorithms for MIMO FDE: least mean squares (LMS) and recursive least squares (RLS). We analyze tradeoffs between computational complexity, cyclic prefix efficiency, adaptation time and output symbol-error ratio (SER), and the impact of channel group delay spread and fast Fourier transform (FFT) block length on these. Using FDE, computational complexity increases sublinearly with the number of modes, in contrast to TDE. Adaptation to an initially unknown fiber can be achieved in ~3-5 \u03bcs using RLS or ~15-25 \u03bcs using LMS in fibers supporting 6-30 modes. As compared to LMS, RLS achieves faster adaptation, higher cyclic prefix efficiency, lower SER, and greater tolerance to mode-dependent loss, but at the cost of higher complexity per FFT block. To ensure low computational complexity and fast adaptation in an MDM system, a low overall group delay spread is required. This is achieved here by a family of graded-index graded depressed-cladding fibers in which the uncoupled group delay spread decreases with an increasing number of modes, in concert with strong mode coupling.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2014.2303079","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/6808425/06727415.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2014.2303079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6808425","startPage":"1841","endPage":"1852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Frequency-Domain Equalization in Mode-Division Multiplexing Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6727415","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Frequency-Domain Equalization in Mode-Division Multiplexing Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"May15,  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727415/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"32","issue":"10","publicationDate":"May15, 2014","accessionNumber":"14267039","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6727415/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1101905"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Frequency-Domain Equalization in Mode-Division Multiplexing Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-arik-2303079-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158744S","chronDate":"May15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6808425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"6808425","articleId":"6727415","onlineDate":"28 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6727437,"authors":[{"name":"Ho-Jin Song","affiliation":["NTT Corporation, Microsystem Integration Laboratories, Kanagawa, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6754198/6727437/6727437-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ho-Jin Song (s'01\u2013M'06\u2013SM'13) received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from Kyungpook National University, Kyungpook, Korea, in 1999, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in information and communications engineering from the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), Gwangju, Korea, in 2001, and 2005, respectively.","From 2005 to 2006, he was with the Center for Hybrid Optical Access Networks (CHOAN), GIST, as a Research Professor, where he was engaged in research on millimeter-wave communications systems utilizing radio-over-fiber technologies.

In this paper, the concept of cooperative control in multiagent systems is introduced for modular dc-dc converters. Each constituent converter is represented by a node in a directed communication graph that models the information flow among converters. The proposed cooperative control scheme enjoys structural modularity, plug-and-play capability, fault tolerance against random failures in the converters and/or communication links, and satisfactory dynamic performance. This paper provides a general analytical framework to study modular dc-dc converters with an arbitrary communication graph. Hence, the designer has the freedom to choose among the various types of graphs based on the available communication resources and the desired level of reliability and fault tolerance. The dynamic model of the cooperative multiconverter system is developed and analyzed.

Improved methods to assess the local stability, design locally stabilizing control laws, and estimate the domain of attraction are developed in terms of single-parameter minimization problems subject to linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints. The improvement is achieved by applying a convergent LMI relaxation technique to prove positivity of homogeneous polynomial parameter-dependent matrices of arbitrary degree with variables in the simplex. We also take advantage of the recently developed parameter variation modeling technique to deal with the case that the variation rate of the membership functions of the T-S fuzzy systems is bounded and less than one. Finally, several illustrative examples demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2014.2302493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6963534","startPage":"1654","endPage":"1668","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/6963534/06727453.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2014.2302493","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Generalized Local Stability and Local Stabilization Conditions for Discrete-Time Takagi\u2013Sugeno Fuzzy Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability analysis","Fuzzy systems","Lyapunov methods","Nonlinear systems","Asymptotic stability","Symmetric matrices","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","discrete time systems","fuzzy control","linear matrix inequalities","nonlinear control systems","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized local stability","local stabilization condition","discrete-time Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems","discrete-time nonlinear systems","T-S fuzzy system","locally stabilizing control law design","attraction domain estimation","single-parameter minimization","linear matrix inequality","LMI constraints","convergent LMI relaxation technique","homogeneous polynomial parameter-dependent matrix","parameter variation modeling technique","membership functions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Domain of attraction (DA)","fuzzy Lyapunov functions (FLFs)","local stability","nonlinear systems","Takagi\u2013Sugeno (T\u2013S) fuzzy systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","displayDocTitle":"On the Generalized Local Stability and Local Stabilization Conditions for Discrete-Time Takagi\u2013Sugeno Fuzzy Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727453/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2014","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6727453/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14778310","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Generalized Local Stability and Local Stabilization Conditions for Discrete-Time Takagi\u2013Sugeno Fuzzy Systems","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-lee-2302493-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119577S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"6963534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6963534","articleId":"6727453","onlineDate":"28 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6727469,"authors":[{"name":"Ren\u00e9 Vargas","affiliation":["ABB Switzerland, R&D Traction Converters, Turgi, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/6815993/6727469/6727469-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ren\u00e9 Vargas (S\u201905\u2013M\u201909) received the Engineer and M.Sc. degrees in electronics engineering, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree for his work on predictive control applied to matrix converters from the Universidad T\u00e9cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda (UTFSM), Valpara\u00edso, Chile, in 2009.","For a total period of eight months within 2006\u20132008, he was with the Institute of Power Electronics and Electrical Drives, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany.

Streaming of multimedia data can usually withstand a certain level of data loss, yet have strict limitations on the latency tolerance. To enable acceptable reliability of transmission and low transmission latency, the channel coding approach is usually more appealing at the cost of additional bandwidth. In this paper, an \\(N\\) -cycle layer-aligned overlapping structure, which is good for layered data, is proposed. Accordingly, layer-aligned multipriority rateless codes were developed with favorable probabilities to control the protection strength for each layer of the streaming data. The major contribution of this paper is the analytical model developed to predict the failure decoding probabilities for each video layer and it is shown to achieve accurate estimation. A prediction model to estimate the expected decompressible video frames was developed for use with the developed codes for streaming scalable videos. By maximizing the number of expected decompressible video frames, the protection strength of the developed codes can then be determined. Simulation results show that the developed codes are good for streaming layered videos, which are difficult to deal with using traditional rateless codes, with or without unequal error protection.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2302533","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/6869080/06727474.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6869080","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2302533","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","startPage":"1395","endPage":"1404","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Layer-Aligned Multipriority Rateless Codes for Layered Video Streaming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6727474","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Layer-Aligned Multipriority Rateless Codes for Layered Video Streaming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727474/","volume":"24","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6727474/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14501167","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministry of Economic Affairs of Taiwan","grantNumber":"102-EC-17-A-03-S1-214"},{"fundingName":"National Science Council of Taiwan","grantNumber":"101-2221-E-009-086-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Layer-Aligned Multipriority Rateless Codes for Layered Video Streaming","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-hsiao-2302533-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099854S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6869080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6869080","articleId":"6727474","onlineDate":"28 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6727483,"authors":[{"name":"Sungwoong Kim","affiliation":["Qualcomm Research Korea, Gangnam Gu, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6868318/6727483/6727483-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sungwoong Kim (S\u201907-M\u201912) received the BS and PhD degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2004 and 2011, respectively.

To consider short- and long-range dependency among various regions of an image and also to incorporate wider selection of features, a higher-order correlation clustering (HO-CC) is incorporated in the framework. Correlation clustering (CC), which is a graph-partitioning algorithm, was recently shown to be effective in a number of applications such as natural language processing, document clustering, and image segmentation. It derives its partitioning result from a pairwise graph by optimizing a global objective function such that it simultaneously maximizes both intra-cluster similarity and inter-cluster dissimilarity. In the HO-CC, the pairwise graph which is used in the CC is generalized to a hypergraph which can alleviate local boundary ambiguities that can occur in the CC. Fast inference is possible by linear programming relaxation, and effective parameter learning by structured support vector machine is also possible by incorporating a decomposable structured loss function. Experimental results on various data sets show that the proposed HO-CC outperforms other state-of-the-art image segmentation algorithms. The HO-CC framework is therefore an efficient and flexible image segmentation framework.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/6868318/06727483.pdf","startPage":"1761","endPage":"1774","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2303095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2303095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6868318","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6727483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Segmentation UsingHigher-Order Correlation Clustering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Clustering algorithms","Image edge detection","Vectors","Correlation","Inference algorithms","Partitioning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","image segmentation","linear programming","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["higher order correlation clustering","hypergraph based image segmentation framework","graph partitioning algorithm","pairwise graph","linear programming relaxation","parameter learning","support vector machine"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image segmentation","correlation clustering","structural learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727483/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Image Segmentation UsingHigher-Order Correlation Clustering","volume":"36","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6727483/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14485674","pubMedId":"26352230","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Segmentation UsingHigher-Order Correlation Clustering","sourcePdf":"tpami-kim-2303095-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093144S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6868318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"6868318","articleId":"6727483","onlineDate":"28 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6727491,"authors":[{"name":"Afshin Samadi","affiliation":["Department of Electric Power Systems, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/6819482/6727491/6727491-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Afshin Samadi (S'12) was born in Hamedan, Iran.

One of the proposed remedies for voltage rise is reactive power contribution by PV systems. Recent German Grid Codes (GGC) introduce an active power dependent (APD) standard characteristic curve, Q(P), for inverter-coupled distributed generators. This study utilizes the voltage sensitivity matrix and quasi-static analysis in order to locally and systematically develop a coordinated Q(P) characteristic for each PV system along a feeder. The main aim of this paper is to evaluate the technical performance of different aspects of proposed Q(P) characteristics. In fact, the proposed method is a systematic approach to set parameters in the GGC Q(P) characteristic. In the proposed APD method the reactive power is determined based on the local feed-in active power of each PV system. However, the local voltage is also indirectly taken into account. Therefore, this method regulates the voltage in order to keep it under the upper steady-state voltage limit. Moreover, several variants of the proposed method are considered and implemented in a simple grid and a complex utility grid. The results demonstrate the voltage-regulation advantages of the proposed method in contrast to the GGC standard characteristic.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727491/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","volume":"29","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2014","accessionNumber":"14318875","publicationDate":"June 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6727491/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Coordinated Active Power-Dependent Voltage Regulation in Distribution Grids With PV Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated Active Power-Dependent Voltage Regulation in Distribution Grids With PV Systems","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-samadi-2298614-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093844S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6819482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"142","xplore-issue":"6819482","articleId":"6727491","onlineDate":"28 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":6727505,"authors":[{"name":"Asad A.

The validity of the modulation and capacitor voltage strategy presented are confirmed using simulation and experimentation. The hybrid cascaded converter is extendable to a large number of cells, making it applicable to high voltage applications, and operation is independent of modulation index and power factor. On these ground, the converter is expected to be applicable for both real and reactive power applications.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2014.2303111","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6883248/06727522.pdf","startPage":"65","endPage":"77","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2014.2303111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6883248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Multilevel Converter With Cascaded H-bridge Cells for HVDC Applications: Operating Principle and Scalability","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6727522","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727522/","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Multilevel Converter With Cascaded H-bridge Cells for HVDC Applications: Operating Principle and Scalability","volume":"30","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"14543406","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6727522/","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Multilevel Converter With Cascaded H-bridge Cells for HVDC Applications: Operating Principle and Scalability","sourcePdf":"tpel-adam-2303111-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092002S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6883248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"6883248","articleId":"6727522","onlineDate":"28 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":6727525,"authors":[{"name":"Meiguang Jin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6846390/6727525/jin-2302531-small.gif","p":["Meiguang Jin received the B.Sc. degree in automation from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Korea, in 2011 and 2013, respectively.","He is a Research Assistant with the Bioinformatics Institute, Agency for Science and Technology Research, Singapore.

This paper proposes a novel matting algorithm that can extract high-quality mattes from different regions of an image. Our proposed algorithm combines propagation and color-sampling methods. Unlike previous propagation-based approaches that use either local or nonlocal propagation methods, our propagation framework adaptively uses both local and nonlocal processes according to the detection results of the different regions in the image. Our color-sampling strategy, which is based on the characteristics of the superpixel, uses a simple sample selection criterion and requires significantly less computational cost than previous color-sampling methods. Experimental results show that our adaptive propagation framework, alone, outperforms the state-of-the-art propagation-based approaches. Combined with our color-sampling method, it can effectively handle different regions in the image and produce both visually and quantitatively high-quality matting results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6846390","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2302531","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/6846390/06727525.pdf","startPage":"1101","endPage":"1110","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2302531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Propagation-Based Color-Sampling for Alpha Matting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Propagation-Based Color-Sampling for Alpha Matting","volume":"24","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6727525/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14429426","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727525/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"MSIP (Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning), Korea, under the CITRC (Convergence Information Technology Research Center) support program supervised by the NIPA (National IT IndustryPromotion Agency)","grantNumber":"NIPA-2014-H0401-14-1001"},{"fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingName":"Korea government (MEST)","grantNumber":"2012R1A2A2A01011112"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Propagation-Based Color-Sampling for Alpha Matting","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-song-2302531-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059562S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6846390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6846390","articleId":"6727525","onlineDate":"28 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6727526,"authors":[{"name":"Youjun Zhang","affiliation":["College of Mechanical and Electric Engineering Soochow University, Suzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6850100/6727526/6727526-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Youjun Zhang was born in Anhui Province, China, in 1970.

The operation principle was studied in detail, and the relationship with the optimization of control parameters of ACCPA's two duty ratios was analyzed for regulating the phase and amplitude of its output voltage. The phase is regulated in the front part, and the amplitude is regulated in the back part. For phase regulation, two methods were proposed to select optimal control parameters dynamically. The curves followed by two methods are crossed at the reference phase angle and have the same initial control parameters. It is necessary to adjust two independent control parameters for method 1 and one parameter for method 2. So method 2 is simple, easy to implement and has high control stability in comparison with method 1. The control strategy of ACCPA was presented and a prototype of single-phase ACCPA was manufactured. The experimental results verified the correctness of the theory and the feasibility of the control strategy.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equations","Voltage control","Power harmonic filters","Harmonic analysis","Reactive power","Capacitors","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-AC power convertors","optimal control","optimisation","phase control","power system stability","power transmission control","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-AC converter","controllable phase-and-amplitude","virtual quadrature source concept","VQS","power transmission control","control variables","phase regulation","amplitude regulation","control parameter optimization","optimal control parameter selection","reference phase angle","independent control parameter adjustment","high control stability","single-phase ACCPA","duty ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AC\u2013AC converter with controllable phase and amplitude (ACCPA)","control parameter","control strategy","phase regulation","power transmission"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2014.2303199","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6850100/06727526.pdf","startPage":"6235","endPage":"6244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6850100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2014.2303199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AC\u2013AC Converter With Controllable Phase and Amplitude","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6727526","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"AC\u2013AC Converter With Controllable Phase and Amplitude","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727526/","volume":"29","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6727526/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14429986","dateOfInsertion":"08 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AC\u2013AC Converter With Controllable Phase and Amplitude","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhang-2303199-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086741S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6850100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6850100","articleId":"6727526","onlineDate":"28 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6727537,"authors":[{"name":"Dongyue Xue","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6923505/6727537/xue-2303089-small.gif","p":["\nDongyue Xue (S'11) received the B.S. degree in information engineering\nfrom Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer\nengineering from The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.","His research interests include cross-layer scheduling in wireless networks and dynamic resource allocation in\ncognitive radio networks."]},"firstName":"Dongyue","lastName":"Xue","id":"37722173400"},{"name":"Eylem Ekici","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6923505/6727537/ekici-2303089-small.gif","p":["\nEylem Ekici (S'99\u2013M'02\u2013SM'11) received the B.S. and M.S.\ndegrees in computer engineering from Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 1997 and 1998, respectively, and the\nPh.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA, in\n2002.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The Ohio State\nUniversity, Columbus, OH, USA.

However, compared to rolled and plain fingerprint matching, latent identification accuracy is significantly lower due to complex background noise, poor ridge quality and overlapping structured noise in latent images. Accordingly, manual markup of various features (e.g., region of interest, singular points and minutiae) is typically necessary to extract reliable features from latents. To reduce this markup cost and to improve the consistency in feature markup, fully automatic and highly accurate (\u201clights-out\u201d capability) latent matching algorithms are needed. In this paper, a dictionary-based approach is proposed for automatic latent segmentation and enhancement towards the goal of achieving \u201clights-out\u201d latent identification systems. Given a latent fingerprint image, a total variation (TV) decomposition model with L1 fidelity regularization is used to remove piecewise-smooth background noise. The texture component image obtained from the decomposition of latent image is divided into overlapping patches. Ridge structure dictionary, which is learnt from a set of high quality ridge patches, is then used to restore ridge structure in these latent patches. The ridge quality of a patch, which is used for latent segmentation, is defined as the structural similarity between the patch and its reconstruction. Orientation and frequency fields, which are used for latent enhancement, are then extracted from the reconstructed patch. To balance robustness and accuracy, a coarse to fine strategy is proposed. Experimental results on two latent fingerprint databases (i.e., NIST SD27 and WVU DB) show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art segmentation and enhancement algorithms and boosts the performance of a state-of-the-art commercial latent matcher.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2302450","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/6868318/06727538.pdf","startPage":"1847","endPage":"1859","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2302450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6868318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segmentation and Enhancement of Latent Fingerprints: A Coarse to Fine RidgeStructure Dictionary","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727538/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Segmentation and Enhancement of Latent Fingerprints: A Coarse to Fine RidgeStructure Dictionary","volume":"36","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2014","accessionNumber":"14500724","pubMedId":"26352236","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6727538/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmentation and Enhancement of Latent Fingerprints: A Coarse to Fine RidgeStructure Dictionary","sourcePdf":"tpami-cao-2302450-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.174795S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6868318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"6868318","articleId":"6727538","onlineDate":"28 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":6727545,"authors":[{"name":"Makkena Purnachandra Rao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/6755552/6727545/6727545-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Makkena Purnachandra Rao received the M.Tech. degree in systems and signal processing from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad, India, in 2009.

Image splicing is a form of tampering in which an original image is altered by copying a portion from a different source. Because the phenomenon of motion blur is a common occurrence in hand-held cameras, we propose a passive method to automatically detect image splicing using blur as a cue. Specifically, we address the scenario of a static scene in which the cause of blur is due to hand shake. Existing methods for dealing with this problem work only in the presence of uniform space-invariant blur. In contrast, our method can expose the presence of splicing by evaluating inconsistencies in motion blur even under space-variant blurring situations. We validate our method on several examples for different scene situations and camera motions of interest.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2014.2302895","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/6755552/06727545.pdf","startPage":"583","endPage":"595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2014.2302895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6755552","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6727545","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Harnessing Motion Blur to Unveil Splicing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Harnessing Motion Blur to Unveil Splicing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727545/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","volume":"9","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6727545/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14144305","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harnessing Motion Blur to Unveil Splicing","sourcePdf":"tifs-makkena-2302895-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120044S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6755552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6755552","articleId":"6727545","onlineDate":"28 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6727557,"authors":[{"name":"Michail Vasiladiotis","affiliation":["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Laboratory of Industrial Electronics, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6883248/6727557/6727557-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michail Vasiladiotis (S\u201909) was born in Athens, Greece, in 1986.

We propose a receiver that can efficiently deal with the interference and has a relatively low complexity as most of its operations are based on fast Fourier transform and local spline interpolation. The receiver is verified in an experiment with a transducer towed by a surface vessel moving at a high speed; a complicated trajectory of the transducer resulted in a severe Doppler distortion of the signal received on a single hydrophone. The performance of the proposed receiver is investigated for different parameter settings and compared with an ideal receiver with perfect channel knowledge, operating in interference-free scenarios, and mimicking the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the experiment. The proposed receiver has provided error-free detection of encoded data at data rates of 0.5 b/s/Hz at a distance of 40 km and 0.33 b/s/Hz at a distance of 80 km, approaching the performance of the ideal receiver with a less than 3-dB loss in SNR.","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2013.2296842","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/48/7005546/06727561.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2013.2296842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7005546","startPage":"144","endPage":"158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM Transmission Without Guard Interval in Fast-Varying Underwater Acoustic Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6727561","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"OFDM Transmission Without Guard Interval in Fast-Varying Underwater Acoustic Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727561/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"40","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"14863997","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6727561/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM Transmission Without Guard Interval in Fast-Varying Underwater Acoustic Channels","sourcePdf":"joe-zakharov-2296842-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108821S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"7005546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7005546","articleId":"6727561","onlineDate":"28 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6727567,"authors":[{"name":"Di Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6869080/6727567/wu-2302543-small.gif","p":["Di Wu (M\u201906) received the B.S. degree from University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China; the M.S. degree from the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; and the Ph.D. degree in computer science and engineering from Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2000, 2003, and 2007, respectively.","From 2007 to 2009 he was a Post-Doctoral Researcher with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Brooklyn, NY, USA, advised by Prof. K.

In this paper, we first conduct a series of well-designed active and passive measurements on a large-scale cloud gaming platform and identify the significant diversity in the queueing delay and response delay among users. We note that the latency problem largely results from user-specified request routing and inelastic server provisioning. To address latency problem of the cloud gaming platform, we further propose an online control algorithm called iCloudAccess to perform intelligent request dispatching and server provisioning. Our main objective is to cut down the provisioning cost of cloud gaming service providers while still ensuring the user quality-of-experience requirements. We formulate the problem as a constrained stochastic optimization problem and apply the Lyapunov optimization theory to derive the online control algorithm with provable upper bounds. We also conduct extensive trace-driven simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm, and our results show that our proposed algorithm achieves significant gain over other alternative approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2302543","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/6869080/06727567.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2302543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6869080","startPage":"1405","endPage":"1416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"<i>iCloudAccess</i>: Cost-Effective Streaming of Video Games From the Cloud With Low Latency","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6727567","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"<i>iCloudAccess</i>: Cost-Effective Streaming of Video Games From the Cloud With Low Latency","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727567/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14501168","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6727567/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61003242 and 61272397"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"12LGPY53"},{"fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"NCET-11-0542"},{"fundingName":"Guangzhou Pearl River Science and Technology Rising Star Project","grantNumber":"2011J2200086"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar","grantNumber":"S20120011187"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"<italic>iCloudAccess</italic>: Cost-Effective Streaming of Video Games From the Cloud With Low Latency","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-wu-2302543-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064604S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6869080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6869080","articleId":"6727567","onlineDate":"28 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6727570,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Jiang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory for Precision Opto-Mechatronic Technology, Ministry of Education, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6846390/6727570/jiang-2302535-small.gif","p":["Jie Jiang received the bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, and Ph.D. degrees from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, from 1991 to 2000.","She is a Professor with the School of Instrumentation Science and Opto-Electronics Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China.

The task-level parallel and pipeline structure are exploited between the hardware blocks, and the data-level parallel and pipeline architecture are exploited inside each block. Two identical random access memories are adopted with ping-pong operation to execute the key point detection module and the descriptor generation module in task-level parallelism. With speeding up the key point detection module of SIFT, the descriptor generation module has become the bottleneck of the system's performance; therefore, this paper proposes an optimized descriptor generation algorithm. A novel window-dividing method is proposed with square subregions arranged in 16 directions, and the descriptors are generated by reordering the histogram instead of window rotation. Therefore, the main orientation detection block and descriptor generation block run in parallel instead of interactively. With the optimized algorithm cooperating with pipeline structure inside each block, we not only improve the parallelism of the algorithm, but also avoid floating data calculation to save hardware consumption. Thus, the descriptor generation module leads the speed almost 15 times faster than a recent solution. The proposed system was implemented on field programmable gate array and the overall time to extract SIFT features for an image having 512\u00d7512 pixels is only 6.55 ms (sufficient for real-time applications), and the number of feature points can reach up to 2900.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SIFT Hardware Implementation for Real-Time Image Feature Extraction","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2302535","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/6846390/06727570.pdf","startPage":"1209","endPage":"1220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2302535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6846390","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6727570","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727570/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","displayDocTitle":"SIFT Hardware Implementation for Real-Time Image Feature Extraction","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6727570/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2014","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14429430","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61222304"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013286","fundingName":"Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China","grantNumber":"20121102110032"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SIFT Hardware Implementation for Real-Time Image Feature Extraction","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-jiang-2302535-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111589S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6846390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6846390","articleId":"6727570","onlineDate":"28 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6727572,"authors":[{"name":"Yongfei Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Digital Media, School of Computer Science and Engineering, State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6846390/6727572/zhang-2302511-small.gif","p":["Yongfei Zhang (M\u201912) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in pattern recognition and intelligent systems from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2005 and 2011, respectively.","He has been an Assistant Professor with the Beijing Key Laboratory of Digital Media, School of Computer Science and Engineering, and the State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems, Beihang University, Beijing, since 2011.

We observe that priority-driven packet scheduling at the intermediate network routers has a direct and significant impact on the queuing behaviors and delay bound violation probabilities of video packets, as well as the overall end-to-end video distortion. Using learning methods, we develop a packet delay bound violation probability model for video transmission over multihop networks with priority-based packet scheduling. With this model, we can successfully predict the probability of packets being dropped due to violation of specified delay bounds. We also observe that the transmission distortion caused by packet drops exhibits a unique exponential behavior with priority-based packet scheduling. With these analysis results, we formulate the resource allocation for multisession video transmission over networks with priority-driven packet scheduling under delay bound constraints as a multiobjective optimization problem. Evolutionary optimization methods based on single- and multiobjective genetic algorithms are proposed to solve the problem and obtain the optimal resource allocation. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed resource-distortion models and optimization algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/6846390/06727572.pdf","startPage":"1184","endPage":"1196","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2302511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2302511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6846390","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6727572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay-Bounded Priority-Driven Resource Allocation for Video Transmission Over Multihop Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Scheduling algorithms","Packet loss","Probability","Resource management","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","packet radio networks","probability","resource allocation","telecommunication network routing","video communication","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay-bounded priority-driven resource allocation","video transmission","mesh networks","network routers","queuing behaviors","end-to-end video distortion","learning methods","video packet delay bound violation probability model","multihop networks","priority-based packet scheduling","transmission distortion","multisession video transmission","multiobjective optimization problem","evolutionary optimization methods","multiobjective genetic algorithms","resource-distortion models"]},{"kwd":["Distortion modeling","multiobjective optimization","packet loss modeling","packet scheduling","resource allocation","video transmission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727572/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Delay-Bounded Priority-Driven Resource Allocation for Video Transmission Over Multihop Networks","volume":"24","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6727572/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14429422","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61272502"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2010CB327900"},{"fundingName":"National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars","grantNumber":"61125206"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay-Bounded Priority-Driven Resource Allocation for Video Transmission Over Multihop Networks","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-zhang-2302511-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087266S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6846390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6846390","articleId":"6727572","onlineDate":"28 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6727576,"authors":[{"name":"Bardia Bozorgzadeh","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6777594/6727576/6727576-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bardia Bozorgzadeh (s'08) was born in 1983.

The majority of the wind forecasting tools available in the literature provide deterministic prediction, but given the variability and uncertainty of wind, such predictions limit the use of the existing tools for decision-making under uncertain conditions. As a result, probabilistic forecasting, which provides information on uncertainty associated with wind power forecasting, is gaining increased attention. This paper presents a novel hybrid intelligent algorithm for deterministic wind power forecasting that utilizes a combination of wavelet transform (WT) and fuzzy ARTMAP (FA) network, which is optimized by using firefly (FF) optimization algorithm. In addition, support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used to minimize the wind power forecast error obtained from WT+FA+FF. The paper also presents a probabilistic wind power forecasting algorithm using quantile regression method. It uses the wind power forecast results obtained from the proposed hybrid deterministic WT+FA+FF+SVM model to evaluate the probabilistic forecasting performance. The performance of the proposed forecasting model is assessed utilizing wind power data from the Cedar Creek wind farm in Colorado.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power

However, the energy efficiency of the present devices still needs to be improved due to the high energy consumption during wireless communication. In this paper, a compressed sensing (CS) scheme for wireless PW signal acquisition is proposed. With the CS-based scheme, airtime over energy-hungry wireless links can be reduced and energy efficiency of the wireless biosensor can be improved. PW signal is sparse under the discrete cosine transform (DCT) basis. Therefore, the CS-based scheme can efficiently compress and recover the signal by the 1-bit sparse quasi-Toeplitz measurement matrix and the basis pursuit de-noising (BPDN) model. The efficiency improvement of node was evidenced by the practical experiments on a MICAz node. By using the proposed scheme, the average percentage root-mean-square difference (PRD) of 4.23%, energy saving of 35.15% and node prolonging of 54.20% can be achieved.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Seventh International Conference on Sensing Technology (ICST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6698448/6727602/06727672.pdf","startPage":"345","endPage":"350","publicationTitle":"2013 Seventh International Conference on Sensing Technology (ICST)","doi":"10.1109/ICSensT.2013.6727672","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSensT.2013.6727672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6727602","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6727672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing for wireless pulse wave signal acquisition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Wireless sensor networks","Discrete cosine transforms","Sparse matrices","Base stations","Biosensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biosensors","body sensor networks","compressed sensing","discrete cosine transforms","health care","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","medical signal detection","patient monitoring","radio links","signal denoising","sparse matrices","Toeplitz matrices","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","wireless pulse wave signal acquisition","wireless enable pulse wave biosensor","pervasive health care monitoring","noninvasive health care monitoring","energy efficiency","wireless communication","CS-based scheme","energy hungry wireless links","discrete cosine transform","sparse quasi-Toeplitz measurement matrix","basis pursuit denoising","BPDN model","MICAz node","PRD","percentage root mean square difference method","node prolonging","DCT"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressed sensing (CS)","Pulse wave(PW) signal","health care","wireless biosensor","low-power"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727672/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing for wireless pulse wave signal acquisition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6727672/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14067906","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing for wireless pulse wave signal acquisition","confLoc":"Wellington, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"1569810403.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096336S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6698448","isNumber":"6727602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6698448","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6727602","articleId":"6727672","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6727698,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The device is realised through a simple softlitography technique to produce the main detecting structure (membrane) and the detection region(microchannel). The final testing shows the ability of the device to detect an acoustic signal transmitted by an underwater projector at resonance frequency of 200 kHz.

A traditional SDN implementation relies on a logically centralized controller that runs the control plane. However, in a large-scale WAN deployment, this rudimentary centralized approach has several limitations related to performance and scalability. To address these issues, recent proposals have advocated deploying multiple controllers that work cooperatively to control a network. Nonetheless, this approach drags in an interesting problem, which we call the Dynamic Controller Provisioning Problem (DCPP). DCPP dynamically adapts the number of controllers and their locations with changing network conditions, in order to minimize flow setup time and communication overhead. In this paper, we propose a framework for deploying multiple controllers within an WAN. Our framework dynamically adjusts the number of active controllers and delegates each controller with a subset of Openflow switches according to network dynamics while ensuring minimal flow setup time and communication overhead. To this end, we formulate the optimal controller provisioning problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) and propose two heuristics to solve it. Simulation results show that our solution minimizes flow setup time while incurring very low communication overhead.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNSM.2013.6727805","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6727796","startPage":"18","endPage":"25","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Network and Service Management (CNSM 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6713382/6727796/06727805.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Controller Provisioning in Software Defined Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6727805/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Controller Provisioning in Software Defined Networks","conferenceDate":"14-18 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14063190","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Controller Provisioning in Software Defined Networks","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"p018bari.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054917S","chronDate":"14-18 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6713382","isNumber":"6727796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713382","citationCount":"218","xplore-issue":"6727796","articleId":"6727805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6727831,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriela F.

Due to the enormous number of sensor nodes and the constrained resources, specific research challenges can be identified with respect to security. Almost all available commercial and research sensor nodes are equipped with ZigBee transceiver chips, and thus making ZigBee the de-facto standard in WSN communication. Since Joshua Wright's KillerBee Framework was released with its focus on exploring and exploiting the security of ZigBee networks, non security-hardened WSNs increase the risk of being vulnerable against certain attacks such as simple association flooding and packet replay attacks. We propose an anomaly-based approach intrusion detection system (IDS) optimized for ZigBee-based WSN to protect ZigBee-based WSN nodes against KillerBee supported attacks. We describe the KillerBee attack procedure and propose an approach of guarding a ZigBee transceiver. Based on an extended sensor node/network simulation and analysis framework, we demonstrate furthermore how our anomaly-based detection engine can thwart attacks on a ZigBee transceiver.","pdfPath":"/iel7/6713382/6727796/06727840.pdf","startPage":"219","endPage":"226","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Network and Service Management (CNSM 2013)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6727796","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNSM.2013.6727840","doi":"10.1109/CNSM.2013.6727840","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Network and Service Management (CNSM 2013)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6727840","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Zigbee","Wireless sensor networks","IEEE 802.15 Standards","Radiation detectors","Transceivers","Cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","radio transceivers","wireless sensor networks","Zigbee"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor network","network security","ZigBee transceiver chip","WSN communication","de-facto standard","nonsecurity-hardened WSN","packet replay attack","anomaly-based approach","intrusion detection system","IDS","sensor node-network simulation","anomaly-based detection engine","thwart attack","KillerBee framework"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6727840/","displayDocTitle":"Thwarting attacks on ZigBee - Removal of the KillerBee stinger","accessionNumber":"14063225","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6727840/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thwarting attacks on ZigBee - Removal of the KillerBee stinger","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"p219stelte.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070311S","chronDate":"14-18 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6713382","isNumber":"6727796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713382","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6727796","articleId":"6727840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6728065,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The performance of this new system have been evaluated using microscopic simulation.

In this paper, we present a robust algorithm for Multi-Target Tracking (MTT) using a Velodyne 3D HDL-64 Lidar sensor. The main contribution of this paper is a practical framework for selecting and representing useful information from the sensor raw data. Since the sensor produces a huge amount of data, a perception algorithm cannot be carried out in real-time without simplifying the sensor information. Unlike prior works, we introduce hybrid ground classification and the Region of Interest (ROI) identification method in order to filter out the amount of unwanted raw data for the actual tracking. And the environment is also abstracted based on an occupancy grid map. Moreover, we introduce feature based object geometry for precise estimation of the system state. In contrast to prior approaches, which use object geometry for the classification, we use it in order to compensate the unintended dynamics caused by shape change or occlusion. Our proposed MTT algorithm is able to run in real-time with an average processing time of 20ms.

Recently, sparse reconstruction techniques have been used for image classification, and shown to provide excellent robustness to occlusion. This progress has also been leveraged for sparsity based video anomaly detection where test trajectories are expressed as sparse linear combinations of example trajectories from a given (normal or anomalous) class. While sparsity based anomaly detection techniques are promising, they pose practical challenges due to their increased computational burden and the need for generous manually labeled training (even if only for normal event trajectories). Our work focuses on overcoming these limitations. Our central contribution is a dictionary design and optimization technique that can effectively reduce the size of training dictionaries that enable sparsity based classification/anomaly detection without adversely influencing detection performance. We also suggest the use of state of the art automatic trajectory clustering techniques for initializing dictionaries which can alleviate the burden of manual labeling. Experimental results show that significant computational advantages can be obtained with the proposed techniques with little performance loss over using large and manually labeled dictionaries of example trajectories.","displayPublicationTitle":"16th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6712176/6728201/06728355.pdf","startPage":"955","endPage":"960","publicationTitle":"16th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2013)","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2013.6728355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2013.6728355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6728201","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6728355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical methods for sparsity based video anomaly detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Manuals","Trajectory","Art","Lead","Dictionaries","Floors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image reconstruction","video signal processing","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparsity based video anomaly detection","transportation domain","traffic violations","accidents","unsafe driver behavior","street crime","sparse reconstruction techniques","image classification","computational burden","dictionary design","optimization technique","sparsity based classification","automatic trajectory clustering techniques","video-based surveillance systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6728355/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Practical methods for sparsity based video anomaly detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6728355/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14062697","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical methods for sparsity based video anomaly detection","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"0431.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062192S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6712176","isNumber":"6728201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6712176","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6728201","articleId":"6728355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6728366,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Hajiahmadi","affiliation":["Delft University of Technology, Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC), Delft, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Hajiahmadi","id":"37593782200"},{"name":"Victor L.

In this paper, we use an aggregate modeling approach based on the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD), in order to find dynamic optimal routing strategies. An urban area can be divided into homogeneous regions each modeled by a (set of) macroscopic fundamental diagrams. Thus, the problem of route guidance can be solved in a regional fashion by using model predictive control and the novel high-level MFD-based model used for prediction of traffic states in the urban network. The optimal routing advices obtained from the high-level controller can be used as references (to track) for lower-level local controllers installed at the borders of the regions. Hence, the complexity of solving the routing problem will be decreased significantly. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using a multi-origin multi-destination grid network. Further, the obtained results show significant performance of the optimal dynamic route guidance over other static routing methods.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2013.6728366","publicationTitle":"16th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"16th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6712176/6728201/06728366.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2013.6728366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6728201","startPage":"1022","endPage":"1028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal dynamic route guidance: A model predictive approach using the macroscopic fundamental diagram","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6728366","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal dynamic route guidance: A model predictive approach using the macroscopic fundamental diagram","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6728366/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14062682","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6728366/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal dynamic route guidance: A model predictive approach using the macroscopic fundamental diagram","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"0336.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07507S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6712176","isNumber":"6728201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6712176","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6728201","articleId":"6728366","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6728427,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin N.

Consequently, ITS need to handle massive volumes of data, and methods to represent that data in more compact representations are sorely needed. Subspace methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can create accurate low-dimensional models. However, such models are not readily interpretable, as the principal components usually involve a large number of links in the traffic network. In contrast, the CUR matrix decomposition leads to low-dimensional models where the components correspond to individual links in the network; the resulting models can be easily interpreted, and can also be used for compressed sensing of the traffic network. In this paper, the CUR matrix decomposition is applied for two purposes: (1) compression of traffic data; (2) compressed sensing of traffic data. In the former, only data from a \u201crandom\u201d subset of links and time instances is stored. In the latter, data for the entire traffic network is inferred from measurements at a \u201crandom\u201d subset of links. Numerical results for a large traffic network in Singapore demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2013.6728438","publicationTitle":"16th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"16th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6712176/6728201/06728438.pdf","startPage":"1475","endPage":"1480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2013.6728438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6728201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CUR decomposition for compression and compressed sensing of large-scale traffic data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6728438","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6728438/","displayDocTitle":"CUR decomposition for compression and compressed sensing of large-scale traffic data","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14062848","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6728438/","conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CUR decomposition for compression and compressed sensing of large-scale traffic data","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"0509.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057745S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6712176","isNumber":"6728201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6712176","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6728201","articleId":"6728438","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6728454,"authors":[{"name":"John Laird","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering University of New South Wales and Neville Roach Laboratory, NICTA, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Laird","id":"37326024100"},{"name":"D.

While lane-detection on well-marked roads is already available in modern vehicles, finding the boundaries of unmarked or weakly marked roads and lanes as they appear in inner-city and rural environments remains an unsolved problem due to the high variability in scene layout and illumination conditions, amongst others. While recent years have witnessed great interest in this subject, to date no commonly agreed upon benchmark exists, rendering a fair comparison amongst methods difficult. In this paper, we introduce a novel open-access dataset and benchmark for road area and ego-lane detection. Our dataset comprises 600 annotated training and test images of high variability from the KITTI autonomous driving project, capturing a broad spectrum of urban road scenes. For evaluation, we propose to use the 2D Bird's Eye View (BEV) space as vehicle control usually happens in this 2D world, requiring detection results to be represented in this very same space. Furthermore, we propose a novel, behavior-based metric which judges the utility of the extracted ego-lane area for driver assistance applications by fitting a driving corridor to the road detection results in the BEV. We believe this to be important for a meaningful evaluation as pixel-level performance is of limited value for vehicle control. State-of-the-art road detection algorithms are used to demonstrate results using classical pixel-level metrics in perspective and BEV space as well as the novel behavior-based performance measure. All data and annotations are made publicly available on the KITTI online evaluation website in order to serve as a common benchmark for road terrain detection algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2013.6728473","publicationTitle":"16th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"16th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6712176/6728201/06728473.pdf","startPage":"1693","endPage":"1700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6728201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2013.6728473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new performance measure and evaluation benchmark for road detection algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6728473","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A new performance measure and evaluation benchmark for road detection algorithms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6728473/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14062745","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6728473/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new performance measure and evaluation benchmark for road detection algorithms","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"0405.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09952S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6712176","isNumber":"6728201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6712176","citationCount":"277","xplore-issue":"6728201","articleId":"6728473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6728482,"authors":[{"name":"Yingjie Xia","affiliation":["Soochow University, Provincial Key Laboratory for Computer Information Processing Technology, China"],"firstName":"Yingjie","lastName":"Xia","id":"37407393000"},{"name":"Xiumei Li","affiliation":["Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou Institute of Service Engineering, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiumei","lastName":"Li","id":"37579037500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2914-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"}],"articleNumber":"6728482","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Roads","Global Positioning System","State estimation","Microwave integrated circuits","Data integration","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data acquisition","data integration","data structures","Global Positioning System","intelligent transportation systems","road traffic","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multisensor heterogeneous data representation","data-driven ITS","data-driven intelligent transportation systems","heterogeneous data collection","traffic sensors","data sharing","heterogeneous ITS data","traffic features","spatio-temporal-related data integration","granularity levels","cell domain","compu-band","computational domain","data granularity levels","multiscale data units","Sydney coordinated adaptive traffic system","SCATS loop detectors","Global Positioning System","GPS probe vehicles","ITS computational domain","data fusion","traffic state estimation","data utilization improvement","accuracy improvement","data-driven applications"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6728482","abstract":"In data-driven intelligent transportation systems (ITS), the heterogeneous data collected from various traffic sensors are used in multiple practical applications. To achieve the effective data sharing in different applications, this paper proposes the formal representation of heterogeneous ITS data by calculating their common traffic features and integrating the spatio-temporal-related data. According to different granularity levels of ITS data, the formal representation is outlined as three primitives: cell, compu-band, and computational domain, which are from basic units to their combination. The utilization of cell, compu-band, and computational domain shows that different data granularity levels can provide efficient processing for multi-scale data units. Moreover, the data collected from Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System (SCATS) loop detectors and Global Positioning System (GPS) probe vehicles are used to construct the ITS computational domain, and the utilization of their integrated data by data fusion for traffic state estimation is investigated to test the availability and effectiveness of the multi-sensor heterogeneous data representation. The experimental results show that the ITS computational domain can implement effective data integration and sharing, and therefore can improve the accuracy and data utilization in various data-driven applications.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2013.6728482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2013.6728482","startPage":"1750","endPage":"1755","displayPublicationTitle":"16th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6712176/6728201/06728482.pdf","publicationTitle":"16th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2013)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6728201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-sensor heterogeneous data representation for data-driven ITS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Multi-sensor heterogeneous data representation for data-driven ITS","conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6728482/","accessionNumber":"14062681","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6728482/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-sensor heterogeneous data representation for data-driven ITS","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"0087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064811S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6712176","isNumber":"6728201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6712176","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6728201","articleId":"6728482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6728487,"authors":[{"name":"Ismail Bayezit","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Ismail","lastName":"Bayezit","id":"37845860300"},{"name":"Gokhan Inalhan","affiliation":["Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Turkey"],"firstName":"Gokhan","lastName":"Inalhan","id":"37572573400"},{"name":"Bari\u015f Fidan","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Bari\u015f","lastName":"Fidan","id":"37086733563"},{"name":"Jan P.

For a multi-agent systems (MAS) modeling of an ITS, the computation burden is large, as it involves the computation of the state changing of all the agents. And, there are many multi-objective optimization problems in the ITS research. In this paper, we solve the traffic light signaling optimization problem and we take the average delay time and the average stop times as two objectives. We use a famous method of Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). As NSGA-II can be viewed as an intelligent way of running a number of micro-simulations, usually the computation burden is huge. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have been a popular tool for parallel computing. The real transportation system runs in parallel and we think that a parallel tool is more suitable for the simulation and optimization of the system. We test GPU based NSGA-II method on a 4 intersection lattice road network, and on the 18 intersection road network of the Zhongguancun area of Beijing. Compared with the CPU version, the GPU version implementation achieves a speedup factor of 21.46 and 27.64 respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6728496/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14063001","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6728496/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"GPU based Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II for multi-objective traffic light signaling optimization with agent based modeling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU based Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II for multi-objective traffic light signaling optimization with agent based modeling","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"0633.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071141S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6712176","isNumber":"6728201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6712176","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6728201","articleId":"6728496","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6728529,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The detection of cracks is essential to perform pavement maintenance and rehabilitation. Many of the highways agencies, in different countries, are still employing conventional, costly and very time consuming techniques which involve direct human intervention and assessment. Although automated recognition has been successfully performed for many pavement distresses, crack detection remains, to this date, a topic where reservations exist. A novel approach to automatically distinguish cracks in digital pavement images is proposed in this paper. The Gabor filter is proven to be a highly potential technique for multidirectional crack detection that was not done previously using the Gabor filter. Image analysis using the Gabor function is directly related to the mammalian visual perception, hence the choice of this method for crack detection. Results reported in this paper concentrate on pavement images with high levels of surface texture that makes crack detection difficult. An initial detection precision of up to 95% has been reported in this paper showing a good promise in the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6728529/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14062747","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6728529/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Pavement crack detection using the Gabor filter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pavement crack detection using the Gabor filter","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"0589.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064036S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6712176","isNumber":"6728201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6712176","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"6728201","articleId":"6728529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6728533,"authors":[{"name":"Simon Ulbrich","affiliation":["Institute of Control Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Ulbrich","id":"37085645711"},{"name":"Markus Maurer","affiliation":["Institute of Control Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Maurer","id":"37351800500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2914-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"}],"articleNumber":"6728533","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":75,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2287},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision making","Vehicles","Signal processing","Planning","Roads","Markov processes","Urban areas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","intelligent transportation systems","Markov processes","road traffic","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probabilistic online POMDP decision making","lane changes","fully automated driving","Stadtpilot project","Braunschweig inner city ring road","Leonie","urban traffic scenarios","partially observable Markov decision process"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6728533","abstract":"The Stadtpilot project aims at fully automated driving on Braunschweig's inner city ring road.

In this paper, we explore the different tradeoffs involved in map-matching, and analyze how these vary under different location sampling conditions. We propose an algorithm to efficiently adapt the sampling method of the user location in order to reduce the energy consumption over the mobile device, while ensuring a sufficient reliability of the reconstructed path.

The goal is to track the lane centerline while avoiding collisions with obstacles. A nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) framework is used where the control inputs are the front steering angle and the braking torques at the four wheels. The focus of this work is on the development of a tailored algorithm for solving the nonlinear MPC problem. Hardware-in-the-loop simulations with the proposed algorithm show a reduction in the computational time as compared to general purpose nonlinear solvers. Experimental tests on a passenger vehicle at high speeds on low friction road surfaces show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6728576/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14062962","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6728576/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Predictive control of an autonomous ground vehicle using an iterative linearization approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive control of an autonomous ground vehicle using an iterative linearization approach","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"0371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052032S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6712176","isNumber":"6728201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6712176","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6728201","articleId":"6728576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":6728584,"authors":[{"name":"Diana Delibaltov","affiliation":["Diana Delibaltov is with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Diana","lastName":"Delibaltov","id":"38015981200"},{"name":"Wencheng Wu","affiliation":["Research Center in Webster, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Wencheng","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085813008"},{"name":"Robert P.

However, emergency stop is not necessarily the best way to react if current sensor fails. This paper proposes a survivable operation technique for three-phase IM drives in the event of current sensor failure. The basic objective of survivable operation for IM is to seamlessly switch the control method from vector control to a simplified digital control with smooth transition strategy in the event of current sensor failure. Using this technique, the IM system can be kept running even when there are current sensor faults. It can therefore add one extra redundancy in EVs and make them safer and more reliable. Simulation and experimental results, including current sensor failure detection, speed and torque response, voltage vector, and phase-current waveforms, are included to show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6728610/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","volume":"2","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"14485760","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6728610/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Survivable Operation of Induction Machine Drives With Smooth Transition Strategy for EV Applications","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004944","fundingName":"Department of Energy","grantNumber":"DE-EE-0002979"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Survivable Operation of Induction Machine Drives With Smooth Transition Strategy for EV Applications","sourcePdf":"jestpe-shi-2303488-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091385S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6245517","isNumber":"6868320","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245517","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6868320","articleId":"6728610","onlineDate":"29 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6728615,"authors":[{"name":"Yanfei Zhong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping, and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yanfei","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37401258700"},{"name":"Xuemei Lin","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping, and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xuemei","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086643568"},{"name":"Liangpei Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping, and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Liangpei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292618700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1939-1404"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-1535"}],"articleNumber":"6728615","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":812},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience & Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Context modeling","Training","Remote sensing","Data models","Vectors","Labeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","fractals","geophysical image processing","hyperspectral imaging","image classification","image resolution","image segmentation","land cover","Markov processes","object-oriented methods","probability","support vector machines","terrain mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified conditional random field classifier","support vector conditional random field classifier","Mahalanobis distance boundary constraint","high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery","spectral term","probability","spatial smoothing","high spatial resolution image classification approaches","complex land-cover class distribution","training samples","QuickBird imagery","IKONOS imagery","HYDICE imagery","noncontextual multiclass SVM","object-oriented classifier","object-oriented classification","fractal net evolution approach segmentation","simplified CRF model with boundary constraint","Markov random fields","Markovian support vector classifier","SVRFMC algorithm","multispectral HSR imagery","hyperspectral HSR imagery","limited training samples","quantitative evaluations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Conditional random fields (CRFs)","high spatial resolution (HSR) imagery","mahalanobis distance boundary constraint","support vector machine (SVM)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6728615","abstract":"In this paper, a modified conditional random fields (CRFs) classifier, namely the support vector conditional random fields classifier with a Mahalanobis distance boundary constraint (SVRFMC), is proposed to perform the task of classification for high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing imagery. In SVRFMC, the CRFs model has the intrinsic ability of incorporating the contextual information in both the observation and labeling fields. Support vector machine (SVM) is set as the spectral term to get a more precise estimation of each pixel's probability of belonging to each possible class. To preserve the spatial details in the classification result, a Mahalanobis distance boundary constraint is considered as the spatial term to undertake appropriate spatial smoothing. By integrating SVM and a Mahalanobis distance boundary constraint, SVRFMC can not only avoid the explicit modeling of observed data, but can also undertake appropriate smoothing with the consideration of contextual information, thereby exhibiting more universality and validity in the application of HSR image classification, especially when the image has a complex land-cover class distribution and the training samples are limited. Three HSR images comprising QuickBird, IKONOS, and HYDICE imagery were utilized to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in comparison to other image classification approaches: noncontextual multiclass SVM, a traditional object-oriented classifier (OOC), an object-oriented classification based on fractal net evolution approach (FNEA) segmentation (OO-FNEA), a simplified CRF model with boundary constraint (BC-CRF), and a recently proposed contextual classifier combining SVM and Markov random fields (Markovian support vector classifier). The experimental results demonstrate that the SVRFMC algorithm is superior to the other methods, providing a satisfactory classification result for HSR imagery, including both multispectral HSR imagery and hyperspectral HSR imagery, even with limited training samples, from both the visualization and quantitative evaluations.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2290296","startPage":"1314","endPage":"1330","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2290296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803891","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/6803891/06728615.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Support Vector Conditional Random Fields Classifier With a Mahalanobis Distance Boundary Constraint for High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6728615/","displayDocTitle":"A Support Vector Conditional Random Fields Classifier With a Mahalanobis Distance Boundary Constraint for High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery","volume":"7","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14251326","publicationDate":"April 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Support Vector Conditional Random Fields Classifier With a Mahalanobis Distance Boundary Constraint for High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery","sourcePdf":"jstars-zhong-2290296-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07613S","chronDate":"April  2014","isNumber":"6803891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"57","articleId":"6728615","onlineDate":"29 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-04"},{"_id":6728616,"authors":[{"name":"Sung-Kun Park","affiliation":["Technology Development Team, System IC Division of SK Hynix, Cheongju-Si, Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-Kun","lastName":"Park","id":"37085355226"},{"name":"Hyun-Min Song","affiliation":["Technology Development Team, System IC Division of SK Hynix, Cheongju-Si, Korea"],"firstName":"Hyun-Min","lastName":"Song","id":"37086637019"},{"name":"Nam-Yoon Kim","affiliation":["Technology Development Team, System IC Division of SK Hynix, Cheongju-Si, Korea"],"firstName":"Nam-Yoon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085349991"},{"name":"In-Wook Cho","affiliation":["Technology Development Team, System IC Division of SK Hynix, Cheongju-Si, Korea"],"firstName":"In-Wook","lastName":"Cho","id":"37085357718"},{"name":"Kyung-Dong Yoo","affiliation":["Technology Development Team, System IC Division of SK Hynix, Cheongju-Si, Korea"],"firstName":"Kyung-Dong","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37085358289"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"6728616","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":514},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Couplings","Programming","Nonvolatile memory","Capacitance","Hot carriers","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","power integrated circuits","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["threshold voltage window","erasing time","band-to-band tunneling-assisted hot hole method","channel hot electron method","multitime programmable features","memory cell","distinct cell structure","lateral capacitance coupling","control gate","single-poly process","lateral coupling method","technology shrinkage","complex double-polyprocess","SG coupling devices","high-voltage CMOS process","SG lateral coupling embedded nonvolatile memory","HVCMOS process","select gate lateral coupling single-poly eNVM","size 90 nm","time 20 mus","time 100 ms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coupling ratio","embedded flash","nonvolatile memory (NVM)","select gate (SG)","lateral coupling"]}],"abstract":"We present a novel select gate (SG) lateral coupling embedded nonvolatile memory without any additional steps on a 90-nm high-voltage CMOS process. Usually, the SG coupling devices use a complex double poly process. However, continuing technology shrinkage makes the lateral coupling method possible for a single poly process. The SG of the novel cell is designed to function as a control gate and an SG at the same time, using only lateral capacitance coupling. Because of this distinct cell structure and operating principle, the memory cell has relatively small cell size, over-erase free, and multitime programmable features. The proposed cell is programmed by channel hot electron method and erased by band-to-band tunneling-assisted hot hole method, resulting in a 20- \u03bcs programming time and 100-ms erasing time.

In our method, the watermark signals represent the macroblock's and frame's indices, and are embedded into the nonzero quantized discrete cosine transform value of blocks, mostly the last nonzero values, enabling our method to detect spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal tampering. Our method can be easily configured to adjust transparency, robustness, and capacity of the system according to the specific application at hand. In addition, our method takes advantage of content-based cryptography and increases the security of the system. While our method can be applied to any modern video codec, including the recently released high-efficiency video coding standard, we have implemented and evaluated it using the H.264/AVC codec, and we have shown that compared with the existing similar methods, which also embed extra bits inside video frames, our method causes significantly smaller video distortion, leading to a PSNR degradation of about 0.88 dB and structural similarity index decrease of 0.0090 with only 0.05% increase in bitrate, and with the bit correct rate of 0.71 to 0.88 after H.264/AVC recompression.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2014.2299371","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/6782641/06728625.pdf","startPage":"1057","endPage":"1072","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2014.2299371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6782641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tampering Detection in Compressed Digital Video Using Watermarking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6728625","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6728625/","displayDocTitle":"Tampering Detection in Compressed Digital Video Using Watermarking","volume":"63","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14219988","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6728625/","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tampering Detection in Compressed Digital Video Using Watermarking","sourcePdf":"tim-fallahpour-2299371-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138663S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6782641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6782641","articleId":"6728625","onlineDate":"29 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6728636,"authors":[{"name":"Hong-Bing Zeng","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/6814883/6728636/zeng-2272399-small.gif","p":["Hong-Bing Zeng received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Tianjin University of Technology and Education, Tianjin, China in 2003, the M.S. degree in computer science from Central South University of Forestry, Changsha, China, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering from Central South University, Changsha, China, in 2012.","Since 2003, he has been with the Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University of Technology, Zhuzhou, China, where he is currently an Associate Professor of automatic control engineering.

Conventional approaches are frustrated by the following two drawbacks. First, both the local and global spatial arrangements of image regions play an important role in photo aesthetics. However, existing rules, e.g., visual balance, heuristically define which spatial distribution among the salient regions of a photo is aesthetically pleasing. Second, it is difficult to adjust visual cues from multiple channels automatically in photo aesthetics assessment. To solve these problems, we propose a new photo aesthetics evaluation framework, focusing on learning the image descriptors that characterize local and global structural aesthetics from multiple visual channels. In particular, to describe the spatial structure of the image local regions, we construct graphlets small-sized connected graphs by connecting spatially adjacent atomic regions. Since spatially adjacent graphlets distribute closely in their feature space, we project them onto a manifold and subsequently propose an embedding algorithm. The embedding algorithm encodes the photo global spatial layout into graphlets. Simultaneously, the importance of graphlets from multiple visual channels are dynamically adjusted. Finally, these post-embedding graphlets are integrated for photo aesthetics evaluation using a probabilistic model. Experimental results show that: 1) the visualized graphlets explicitly capture the aesthetically arranged atomic regions; 2) the proposed approach generalizes and improves four prominent aesthetic rules; and 3) our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in photo aesthetics prediction.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fusion of Multichannel Local and Global Structural Cues for Photo Aesthetics Evaluation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2014.2303650","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/6717077/06728663.pdf","startPage":"1419","endPage":"1429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2014.2303650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6717077","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6728663","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6728663/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","displayDocTitle":"Fusion of Multichannel Local and Global Structural Cues for Photo Aesthetics Evaluation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6728663/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2014","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14110529","pubMedId":"24723537","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fusion of Multichannel Local and Global Structural Cues for Photo Aesthetics Evaluation","sourcePdf":"tip-gao-2303650-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116794S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6717077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"6717077","articleId":"6728663","onlineDate":"29 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6728664,"authors":[{"name":"Song Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, U.S."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/6879345/6728664/6728664-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Song Zhang (S'13) was born in Chengdu, China.

Communication systems play a critical role in interactive grid control as an indispensable medium to transmit wide-area measurements; however, they are vulnerable to disruptions leading to the risk of destabilizing power systems. This work addresses a critical issue related to engineering resilient cyber-physical systems. The proposed framework utilizes a hierarchical set of wide-area measurements for control and employs channel switching based on mathematical morphology identification to counteract the impact of communication failures on control effectiveness. The proposed control framework incorporating a set of synchronized wide-area measurements is designed to consist of multiple single-input single-output supplementary damping controllers associated with a static VAr compensator.

To capture these high speed effects a very large number of system equations is normally required and hence model order reduction techniques are required to make the simulation of the circuits computationally feasible. This paper proposes a higher order Krylov subspace algorithm for model order reduction of time-delay systems based on a Laguerre expansion technique. The proposed technique consists of three sections i.e., first the delays are approximated using the recursive relation of Laguerre polynomials, then in the second part, the reduced order is estimated for the time-delay system using a delay truncation in the Laguerre domain and in the third part, a higher order Krylov technique using Laguerre expansion is computed for obtaining the reduced order time-delay system. The proposed technique is validated by means of real world numerical examples.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2013.2295011","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/6820808/06728665.pdf","startPage":"1815","endPage":"1823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2013.2295011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6820808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Order Reduction of Time-Delay Systems Using a Laguerre Expansion Technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6728665/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","displayDocTitle":"Model Order Reduction of Time-Delay Systems Using a Laguerre Expansion Technique","volume":"61","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14331928","htmlLink":"/document/6728665/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Order Reduction of Time-Delay Systems Using a Laguerre Expansion Technique","sourcePdf":"tcsi-samuel-2295011-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.371185S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6820808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6820808","articleId":"6728665","onlineDate":"29 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6728666,"authors":[{"name":"Shinya Sugiura","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinya","lastName":"Sugiura","id":"37667603100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"6728666","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1565},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"In this letter, motivated by the recent universal encoding concept of space-time shift keying (STSK), we propose a novel single radio-frequency (RF) based virtual multiple-input multiple-output (VMIMO) architecture, employing a pattern reconfigurable antenna at a transmitter.

The charge transfer inefficiency is evaluated for both CCD modes with regard to the injected charge, and the influence of the rising and falling time effect is explored. Controlling the ramp and especially reducing its abruptness allows to get much lower charge transfer inefficiency in buried CCD mode. On the contrary, we did not observe any effect of the ramp on surface channel CCD mode because of the presence of interface traps at the silicon-oxide interface.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6746059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2014.2298693","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/6746059/06728672.pdf","startPage":"844","endPage":"849","doi":"10.1109/TED.2014.2298693","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of CCD Transport on CMOS Imaging Technology: Comparison Between SCCD and BCCD, and Ramp Effect on the CTI","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","displayDocTitle":"Study of CCD Transport on CMOS Imaging Technology: Comparison Between SCCD and BCCD, and Ramp Effect on the CTI","volume":"61","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6728672/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14115504","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6728672/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of CCD Transport on CMOS Imaging Technology: Comparison Between SCCD and BCCD, and Ramp Effect on the CTI","sourcePdf":"ted-marcelot-2298693-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054031S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"6746059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6746059","articleId":"6728672","onlineDate":"29 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6728674,"authors":[{"name":"Ernesto Serrano-Finetti","affiliation":["Instrumentation, Sensors and Interfaces Group, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, BarcelonaTech, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6826597/6728674/serra-2299525-small.gif","p":["Ernesto Serrano-Finetti (M'10) was born in Lima, Peru, in 1972.

To meet the practical requirement that the energy receiver (ER) operates with significantly higher received power as compared to the conventional information receiver (IR), ERs need to be deployed in more proximity to the transmitter than IRs in the SWIPT system. However, due to the broadcast nature of wireless channels, one critical issue arises that the messages sent to IRs can be eavesdropped by ERs, which possess better channels from the transmitter. In this paper, we address this new physical-layer security problem in a multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) SWIPT system where one multi-antenna transmitter sends information and energy simultaneously to an IR and multiple ERs, each with one single antenna. Two problems are investigated with different practical aims: the first problem maximizes the secrecy rate for the IR subject to individual harvested energy constraints of ERs, while the second problem maximizes the weighted sum-energy transferred to ERs subject to a secrecy rate constraint for IR. We solve these two non-convex problems optimally by a general two-stage procedure. First, by fixing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) target for ERs or IR, we obtain the optimal transmit beamforming and power allocation solution by applying the technique of semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Then, each of the two problems is solved by a one-dimension search over the optimal SINR target for ERs or IR. Furthermore, for each problem, suboptimal solutions of lower complexity are proposed.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2303422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2303422","startPage":"1850","endPage":"1863","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6757015/06728676.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757015","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secrecy Wireless Information and Power Transfer With MISO Beamforming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6728676/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April1,  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Secrecy Wireless Information and Power Transfer With MISO Beamforming","volume":"62","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14155855","publicationDate":"April1, 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6728676/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secrecy Wireless Information and Power Transfer With MISO Beamforming","sourcePdf":"tsp-liu-2303422-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115311S","chronDate":"April1,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6757015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"313","xplore-issue":"6757015","articleId":"6728676","onlineDate":"29 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6728689,"authors":[{"name":"Xianming Liu","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6742656/6728689/6728689-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xianming Liu is currently an Assistant Professor with the Department of Computer Science, Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), Harbin, China.

In this paper, we propose a unified framework to perform progressive image recovery based on hybrid graph Laplacian regularized regression. We first construct a multiscale representation of the target image by Laplacian pyramid, then progressively recover the degraded image in the scale space from coarse to fine so that the sharp edges and texture can be eventually recovered. On one hand, within each scale, a graph Laplacian regularization model represented by implicit kernel is learned, which simultaneously minimizes the least square error on the measured samples and preserves the geometrical structure of the image data space. In this procedure, the intrinsic manifold structure is explicitly considered using both measured and unmeasured samples, and the nonlocal self-similarity property is utilized as a fruitful resource for abstracting a priori knowledge of the images. On the other hand, between two successive scales, the proposed model is extended to a projected high-dimensional feature space through explicit kernel mapping to describe the interscale correlation, in which the local structure regularity is learned and propagated from coarser to finer scales. In this way, the proposed algorithm gradually recovers more and more image details and edges, which could not been recovered in previous scale. We test our algorithm on one typical image recovery task: impulse noise removal. Experimental results on benchmark test images demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance than state-of-the-art algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2014.2303638","startPage":"1491","endPage":"1503","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2014.2303638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742656","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/6742656/06728689.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Progressive Image Denoising Through Hybrid Graph Laplacian Regularization: A Unified Framework","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6728689/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Progressive Image Denoising Through Hybrid Graph Laplacian Regularization: A Unified Framework","volume":"23","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6728689/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14112165","pubMedId":"24565791","publicationDate":"April 2014","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Progressive Image Denoising Through Hybrid Graph Laplacian Regularization: A Unified Framework","sourcePdf":"tip-liu-2303638-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087602S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6742656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"6742656","articleId":"6728689","onlineDate":"29 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":6728690,"authors":[{"name":"Yen-Fu Ou","affiliation":["Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6807541/6728690/ou-2303636-small.gif","p":["Yen-Fu Ou (S'08) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mechanical engineering from National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2000 and 2002, respectively, and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Columbia University, New York, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Brooklyn, NY, USA, in 2011.

Subjective quality tests were carried out on a mobile device and a total of 189 processed video sequences with 10 source sequences included in the test. Subjective data reveal that the impact of spatial resolution (SR), temporal resolution (TR), and quantization stepsize (QS) can each be captured by a function with a single content-dependent parameter, which indicates the decay rate of the quality with each resolution factor. The joint impact of SR, TR, and QS can be accurately modeled by the product of these three functions with only three parameters. The impact of SR and QS on the quality are independent of that of TR, but there are significant interactions between SR and QS. Furthermore, the model parameters can be predicted accurately from a few content features derived from the original video. The proposed model correlates well with the subjective ratings with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.985 when the model parameters are predicted from content features. The quality model is further validated on six other subjective rating data sets with very high accuracy and outperforms several well-known quality models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6728690/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6728690/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2014","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14280769","pubMedId":"24815618","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Q-STAR: A Perceptual Video Quality Model Considering Impact of Spatial, Temporal, and Amplitude Resolutions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Q-STAR: A Perceptual Video Quality Model Considering Impact of Spatial, Temporal, and Amplitude Resolutions","sourcePdf":"tip-ou-2303636-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06953S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6807541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6807541","articleId":"6728690","onlineDate":"29 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6728697,"authors":[{"name":"Kenle Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Birck Nano Technology Center, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6754198/6728697/6728697-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kenle Chen (s'10) received the Bachelor's degree in communication engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2005, the Master's degree in electronics and information engineering from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA, in 2013.","From 2007 to 2008, he was with the Institute of Micro Electronics, National Key Laboratory of Micro/Nano Fabrication, Peking University, where his research focused on RF microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) switches, tunable filters, and vacuum packaging.

In many conventional audio separation algorithms the source mixing parameter estimation is done separately for each frequency thus making them prone to errors and leading to suboptimal source estimates. In this paper we propose a SCM model which consists of a weighted sum of direction of arrival (DoA) kernels and estimate only the weights dependent on the source directions. In the proposed algorithm, the spatial properties of the sources become jointly optimized over all frequencies, leading to more coherent source estimates and mitigating the effect of spatial aliasing at high frequencies. The proposed SCM model is combined with a linear model for magnitudes and the parameter estimation is formulated in a complex-valued non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF) framework. Simulations consist of recordings done with a hand-held device sized array having multiple microphones embedded inside the device casing. Separation quality of the proposed algorithm is shown to exceed the performance of existing state of the art separation methods with two sources when evaluated by objective separation quality metrics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6728698/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","volume":"22","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2014","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14083759","htmlLink":"/document/6728698/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Direction of Arrival Based Spatial Covariance Model for Blind Sound Source Separation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direction of Arrival Based Spatial Covariance Model for Blind Sound Source Separation","sourcePdf":"taslp-nikunen-2303576-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099231S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"6722963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"6722963","articleId":"6728698","onlineDate":"29 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6728704,"authors":[{"name":"Payam Nayeri","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6782660/6728704/6728704-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Payam Nayeri (S'09\u2013M'12) received the B.S. degree in applied physics from Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran, in 2004, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from The University of Mississippi, University, MS, USA, in 2012.","From 2008 to 2012, he was a Graduate Student Researcher with the Center for Applied Electromagnetic Systems Research (CAESR), The University of Mississippi.

Hand Movement Classification","abstract":"There has been increasing interest in applying learning algorithms to improve the dexterity of myoelectric prostheses. In this work, we present a large-scale benchmark evaluation on the second iteration of the publicly released NinaPro database, which contains surface electromyography data for 6 DOF force activations as well as for 40 discrete hand movements. The evaluation involves a modern kernel method and compares performance of three feature representations and three kernel functions. Both the force regression and movement classification problems can be learned successfully when using a nonlinear kernel function, while the exp- \u03c7\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n kernel outperforms the more popular radial basis function kernel in all cases. Furthermore, combining surface electromyography and accelerometry in a multimodal classifier results in significant increases in accuracy as compared to when either modality is used individually. Since window-based classification accuracy should not be considered in isolation to estimate prosthetic controllability, we also provide results in terms of classification mistakes and prediction delay. To this extent, we propose the movement error rate as an alternative to the standard window-based accuracy. This error rate is insensitive to prediction delays and it allows us therefore to quantify mistakes and delays as independent performance characteristics. This type of analysis confirms that the inclusion of accelerometry is superior, as it results in fewer mistakes while at the same time reducing prediction delay.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6728705/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6728705/","dateOfInsertion":"08 July 2014","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14446360","pubMedId":"24760932","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Movement Error Rate for Evaluation of Machine Learning Methods for sEMG-Based Hand Movement Classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Movement Error Rate for Evaluation of Machine Learning Methods for sEMG-Based Hand Movement Classification","sourcePdf":"tnsre-gijsberts-2303394-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079545S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"6848867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"6848867","articleId":"6728705","onlineDate":"29 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6728707,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6742656/6728707/6728707-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nan Jiang received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electronics and information engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2006 and 2011, respectively, where she is currently an Assistant Professor.

Its performance largely depends on the distance metric that determines the quality of visual matching. Rather than using fixed and predefined metric, recent attempts of integrating metric learning-based trackers have shown more robust and promising results, as the learned metric can be more discriminative. In general, these global metric adjustment methods are computationally demanding in real-time visual tracking tasks, and they tend to underfit the data when the target exhibits dynamic appearance variation. This paper presents a nonparametric data-driven local metric adjustment method. The proposed method finds a spatially adaptive metric that exhibits different properties at different locations in the feature space, due to the differences of the data distribution in a local neighborhood. It minimizes the deviation of the empirical misclassification probability to obtain the optimal metric such that the asymptotic error as if using an infinite set of training samples can be approximated. Moreover, by taking the data local distribution into consideration, it is spatially adaptive. Integrating this new local metric learning method into target tracking leads to efficient and robust tracking performance. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed tracking method in various tracking scenarios.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Visualization","Training","Training data","Learning systems","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image matching","probability","target tracking","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven spatially-adaptive metric adjustment","visual appearance matching","consecutive video frames","distance metric","visual matching quality","metric learning-based trackers","global metric adjustment method","real-time visual tracking tasks","dynamic appearance variation","nonparametric data-driven local metric adjustment method","feature space","local neighborhood","empirical misclassification probability","optimal metric","asymptotic error","robust tracking performance","local metric learning method","data local distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Metric adjustment","visual tracking","data-driven","local metric learning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIP.2014.2303656","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/6742656/06728707.pdf","startPage":"1556","endPage":"1568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742656","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2014.2303656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Spatially-Adaptive Metric Adjustment for Visual Tracking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6728707","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Spatially-Adaptive Metric Adjustment for Visual Tracking","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6728707/","volume":"23","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6728707/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14112169","pubMedId":"24569443","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Spatially-Adaptive Metric Adjustment for Visual Tracking","sourcePdf":"tip-liu-2303656-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095331S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6742656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6742656","articleId":"6728707","onlineDate":"29 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6728711,"authors":[{"name":"Dylan F.

So-called strong PUFs provide a mechanism to authenticate chips which is inherently unique for every manufactured sample. To prevent cloning, modeling of the challenge-response pair (CRP) behavior should be infeasible. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are a well-known threat. Recently, repeatability imperfections of PUF responses have been identified as another threat. CMOS device noise renders a significant fraction of the CRPs unstable, hereby providing a side channel for modeling attacks. In previous work, 65 nm arbiter PUFs have been modeled as such with accuracies exceeding 97%. However, more PUF evaluations were required than for state-of-the-art ML approaches. In this work, we accelerate repeatability attacks by increasing the fraction of unstable CRPs. Response evaluation faults are triggered via environmental changes hereby. The attack speed, which is proportional to the fraction of unstable CRPs, increases with a factor 2.4 for both arbiter and ring oscillator (RO) sum PUFs.

The proposed level shifter is a hybrid structure comprising a modified Wilson current mirror and generic CMOS logic gates.

LNA design parameters such as gain, noise figure, linearity, input matching, and stability are important metrics and typically affect the overall performance of the receiver. The strong trade-offs among these design parameters often necessitate several design iterations. While many of these trade-offs are due to the nature of the circuit and are inevitable, it is desirable to decouple the effects of each parameter on the others. In this work, body biasing is introduced as a technique to enhance the linearity, to improve the noise figure and to provide gain variation. These techniques are presented in the context of a three-stage LNA. By applying body biasing in each stage, noise figure, gain variation and linearity of the overall amplifier are adjusted almost independently, i.e., with minimal interrelation among these design parameters. As a proof-of-concept, a prototype 4.4-GHz LNA is designed and fabricated in a 0.13- \u03bcm CMOS technology. The LNA achieves a minimum noise figure of 3.8 dB, maximum gain of 20.2 dB, and a maximum IIP3 of -14 dBm while consuming 3.6 mW from a 1.2 V supply.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6728724/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6728724/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2014","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14331920","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Applications of Body Biasing in Multistage CMOS Low-Noise Amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications of Body Biasing in Multistage CMOS Low-Noise Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"tcsi-rashtian-2290848-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069338S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6820808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6820808","articleId":"6728724","onlineDate":"29 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6728725,"authors":[{"name":"Lifan Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6819879/6728725/zhao-2296497-small.gif","p":["\nLifan Zhao received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Xidian\nUniversity, Xi'an, China, in 2010.

Prior to applying the sparse recovery technique, preprocessing procedures are performed for the minimization of the translational-motion-induced Doppler effects. Due to the imperfection of coarse motion compensation, the autofocus technique is further required to eliminate the residual phase errors. This paper considers the phase error correction problem in the context of the sparse signal recovery technique. In order to encode sparsity, a multitask Bayesian model is utilized to probabilistically formulate this problem in a hierarchical manner. In this novel method, a focused high-resolution radar image is obtained by estimating the sparse scattering coefficients and phase errors in individual and global stages, respectively, to statistically make use of the sparsity. The superiority of this algorithm is that the uncertainty information of the estimation can be properly incorporated to obtain enhanced estimation accuracy. Moreover, the proposed algorithm achieves guaranteed convergence and avoids a tedious parameter-tuning procedure. Experimental results based on synthetic and practical data have demonstrated that our method has a desirable denoising capability and can produce a relatively well-focused image of the target, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio and high undersampling ratio scenarios, compared with other recently reported methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/6819879/06728725.pdf","startPage":"6392","endPage":"6403","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2013.2296497","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2013.2296497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6819879","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6728725","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Autofocus Technique for High-Resolution Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Bayes methods","Image resolution","Signal resolution","Approximation methods","Doppler effect","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","Doppler radar","error correction codes","image coding","image denoising","image resolution","motion compensation","phase estimation","probability","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autofocus technique","high-resolution inverse synthetic aperture radar imagery","inherent sparsity scatterer coefficient","range-Doppler spectrum domain","sparse recovery technique","minimization","translational-motion-induced Doppler effect","coarse motion compensation imperfection","residual phase error elimination","phase error correction problem","sparse signal recovery technique","multitask Bayesian model","probability","high-resolution radar image focusing","parameter-tuning procedure","image denoising","sparsity encoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Autofocus technique","compressive sensing (CS)","high resolution","inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imagery","sparse Bayesian learning"]},{"kwd":["Autofocus technique","compressive sensing (CS)","high resolution","inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imagery","sparse Bayesian learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6728725/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"An Autofocus Technique for High-Resolution Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery","volume":"52","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6728725/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14331710","dateOfInsertion":"22 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Autofocus Technique for High-Resolution Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery","sourcePdf":"tgrs-bi-2296497-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119204S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6819879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"6819879","articleId":"6728725","onlineDate":"29 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6728731,"authors":[{"name":"Zhao Tan","affiliation":["Preston M.

We consider a market where users have the flexibility to sell back the energy generated from their distributed generators or the energy stored in their plug-in electric vehicles. A distributed optimization algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers is developed to solve the optimization problem, in which consumers need to report their aggregated loads only to the utility company, thus ensuring their privacy. Consumers can update their loads scheduling simultaneously and locally to speed up the optimization computing. Using numerical examples, we show that the demand curve is flattened after the optimization, even though there are uncertainties in the model, thus reducing the cost paid by the utility company.

It is possible to mitigate the effect of the write uncertainty through the use of a feedback loop that rewrites the memory whenever judged necessary, in effect reshaping the write noise. This scheme highlights a tradeoff between the storage capacity of the memory and the cost of writing to it, measured for example in the number of rewrites. We have developed the model of a rewritable channel to provide an explicit form for this tradeoff and study other performance characteristics of such memories. In this paper, we describe some initial results on the information-theoretic analysis of the rewritable channel. We first consider the problem of determining the capacity of this channel with input cost constraints, and obtain a variety of results from which we extract insights that we believe are of value to memory designers. Our results include an upper bound on capacity of the form log (\u0393\u03ba), where \u0393 is a constant that can be easily calculated from the channel's statistics and \u03ba is an average cost parameter. We also provide a lower bound on capacity with a similar form. We analyze the particular case of uniform write noise in detail, obtaining a closed form expression for the capacity-cost tradeoff for all possible cost parameters. We explore this formula from the capacity per unit cost perspective and establish that in order to achieve optimal energy and memory-wear per bit, it is sometimes strictly better to take advantage of the rewriting capability as opposed to writing only once; this observation has significant practical implications. We also include a discussion of the relevance of our work to real emerging memory technologies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6728739/","volume":"60","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6728739/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14301837","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Capacity of Memoryless Rewritable Storage Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Capacity of Memoryless Rewritable Storage Channels","sourcePdf":"tit-lastras-2303480-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106764S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6816018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6816018","articleId":"6728739","onlineDate":"29 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6728778,"authors":[{"name":"Marco A.

Various ways of saving energy have been proposed, from energy efficient processing to power aware cluster organization. With communication between nodes being responsible for a large part of the energetic demand, energy efficient methods of communication have been proposed, with multi-hop communication being a wide used technique, capable of minimizing energy consumption and spreading it amongst the network. However, multi-hop is not always more efficient and is prone to a high delay, due to the decode and forward mechanism usually employed. In this paper a cooperative MIMO technique is studied, its energy consumption analyzed, and a mechanism for integrating it in existing WSNs and allowing its coexistence with multi-hop communication is suggested. Energy efficiency, packet delivery delay and packet loss ratios are analyzed and the results compared to standard WSNs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying Cooperative MIMO Technique in an Adaptive Routing Mechanism for Wireless Sensor Networks","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Wireless Sensor (ICWISE)","doi":"10.1109/ICWISE.2013.6728778","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Wireless Sensor (ICWISE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6717190/6728760/06728778.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"52","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWISE.2013.6728778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6728760","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6728778","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6728778/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Applying Cooperative MIMO Technique in an Adaptive Routing Mechanism for Wireless Sensor Networks","conferenceDate":"2-4 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6728778/","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14063959","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying Cooperative MIMO Technique in an Adaptive Routing Mechanism for Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Kuching, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"0471569815483.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053625S","chronDate":"2-4 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6717190","isNumber":"6728760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6717190","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6728760","articleId":"6728778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6728782,"authors":[{"name":"A.

However, the requirements in the industrial systems differ from the general WSN requirements. In recent years, standards have been defined by several industrial alliances. These standards are specified as frameworks with modifiable parts that can be defined based on the particular application of WSN. However, limited work has been done on defining industry-specific protocols that could be used as a part of these standards. In this survey, we discuss representative protocols that meet some of the requirements of the industrial applications. Since the industrial applications domain in itself is a vast area, we divide them into classes with similar requirements. We discuss these industrial classes, set of common requirements and various state-of-the-art WSN standards proposed to satisfy these requirements. We then present a broader view towards the WSN solution by discussing important functions like medium access control, routing, and transport in detail to give some insight into specific requirements and the classification of protocols based on certain factors. We list and discuss representative protocols for each of these functions that address requirements defined in the industrial classes. Security function is discussed in brief, mainly in relation to industrial standards. Finally, we identify unsolved challenges that are encountered during design of protocols and standards. In addition some new challenges are introduced and discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Industrial Perspective on Wireless Sensor Networks \u2014 A Survey of Requirements, Protocols, and Challenges","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","doi":"10.1109/SURV.2014.012114.00058","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/6880447/06728782.pdf","startPage":"1391","endPage":"1412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2014.012114.00058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6880447","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6728782","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6728782/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Third Quarter  2014","displayDocTitle":"An Industrial Perspective on Wireless Sensor Networks \u2014 A Survey of Requirements, Protocols, and Challenges","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6728782/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2014","publicationDate":"Third Quarter 2014","accessionNumber":"14527948","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Industrial Perspective on Wireless Sensor Networks \u2014 A Survey of Requirements, Protocols, and Challenges","sourcePdf":"11Kumar058.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.209348S","chronDate":"Third Quarter  2014","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"6880447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"213","xplore-issue":"6880447","articleId":"6728782","onlineDate":"29 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6728869,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Hung Wei","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The University of Texas at Austin"],"firstName":"Yi-Hung","lastName":"Wei","id":"37086662493"},{"name":"Quan Leng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The University of Texas at Austin"],"firstName":"Quan","lastName":"Leng","id":"37074714300"},{"name":"Song Han","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Connecticut"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Han","id":"37404243100"},{"name":"Aloysius K.

Existing wireless technology standards, however either cannot provide real-time guarantee on packet delivery or are not fast enough to support high-speed control systems which typically require 1kHz or higher sampling rate. Nondeterministic packet transmission and insufficiently high sampling rate will severely hurt the control performance. To address this problem, in this paper, we present our design and implementation of a real-time high-speed wireless communication protocol called RT-WiFi. RT-WiFi is a TDMA data link layer protocol based on IEEE 802.11 physical layer to provide deterministic timing guarantee on packet delivery and high sampling rate up to 6kHz. It incorporates configurable components for adjusting design trade-offs including sampling rate, latency variance, reliability, and compatibility to existing Wi-Fi networks, thus can serve as an ideal communication platform for supporting a wide range of high-speed wireless control systems. We implemented RT-WiFi on commercial off-the-shelf hardware and integrated it into a mobile gait rehabilitation system. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RT-WiFi in providing deterministic packet delivery in both data link layer and application layer, which further eases the controller design and significantly improve the control performance.","doi":"10.1109/RTSS.2013.22","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 34th Real-Time Systems Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 34th Real-Time Systems Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel7/6724380/6728845/06728869.pdf","startPage":"140","endPage":"149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTSS.2013.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6728845","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RT-WiFi: Real-Time High-Speed Communication Protocol for Wireless Cyber-Physical Control Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6728869/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"RT-WiFi: Real-Time High-Speed Communication Protocol for Wireless Cyber-Physical Control Applications","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6728869/","accessionNumber":"14064412","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RT-WiFi: Real-Time High-Speed Communication Protocol for Wireless Cyber-Physical Control Applications","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"2006a140.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087905S","chronDate":"3-6 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6724380","isNumber":"6728845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6724380","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"6728845","articleId":"6728869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6728875,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Dong","affiliation":["Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Service Robot, Zhejiang University, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Dong","id":"37396032500"},{"name":"Chun Chen","affiliation":["Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Service Robot, Zhejiang University, China"],"firstName":"Chun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280741000"},{"name":"Jiajun Bu","affiliation":["Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Service Robot, Zhejiang University, China"],"firstName":"Jiajun","lastName":"Bu","id":"37275132600"},{"name":"Xue Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, McGill University, Canada"],"firstName":"Xue","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086656239"},{"name":"Yunhao Liu","affiliation":["MOE Key Lab for Information System Security, Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Yunhao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086784288"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2006-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1052-8725"}],"articleNumber":"6728875","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":222},"abstract":"Detecting and diagnosing anomalies in networked embedded systems like sensor networks is a very difficult task, due to the variable workloads and severe resource constraints. We notice that most node-level debugging tools can provide detailed program information inside the node but fail to detect when and where a problem occurs in the network. On the other hand, most network-level diagnosis tools can effectively detect a problem from the network but fail to narrow down the problem within the node because they lack detailed program information. To close the gap, we propose D2, a new anomaly detection and diagnosis method by combining program profiling and symptom mining. D2 employs binary instrumentation to perform lightweight function count profiling. Based on the statistics, D2 uses PCA (Principal Component Analysis) based approach for automatically detecting network anomalies. Compared to previous methods, D2 is able to point programmers closer to the most likely causes by a novel approach combining statistical tests and program call graph analysis. We implement our method based on TinyOS 2.1.1 and evaluate its effectiveness by case studies in the development of a working sensor network. Results show that our method is effective for detecting and diagnosing problems in real-world sensor network systems, and at the same time, incurs an acceptable overhead.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 34th Real-Time Systems Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel7/6724380/6728845/06728875.pdf","startPage":"202","endPage":"211","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 34th Real-Time Systems Symposium","doi":"10.1109/RTSS.2013.28","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTSS.2013.28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6728845","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6728875","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"D2: Anomaly Detection and Diagnosis in Networked Embedded Systems by Program Profiling and Symptom Mining","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Instruments","Principal component analysis","Software","Radiation detectors","Educational institutions","Debugging","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","principal component analysis","program debugging","program diagnostics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["D2","anomaly detection","networked embedded system","program profiling","symptom mining","anomaly diagnosis","sensor network","node-level debugging tool","network-level diagnosis tool","binary instrumentation","lightweight function count profiling","PCA","principal component analysis","statistical test","program call graph analysis","TinyOS 2.1.1"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["networked embedded systems","sensor networks","diagnosis","program profiling","symptom mining"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6728875/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"D2: Anomaly Detection and Diagnosis in Networked Embedded Systems by Program Profiling and Symptom Mining","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6728875/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14064402","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"3-6 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"D2: Anomaly Detection and Diagnosis in Networked Embedded Systems by Program Profiling and Symptom Mining","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"2006a202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081374S","chronDate":"3-6 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6724380","isNumber":"6728845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6724380","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6728845","articleId":"6728875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6728876,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Urbana, IL"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085489792"},{"name":"Tarek Abdelzaher","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Urbana, IL"],"firstName":"Tarek","lastName":"Abdelzaher","id":"37267896800"},{"name":"Lance Kaplan","affiliation":["Networked Sensing and Fusion Branch, US Army Research Labs, Adelphi, MD"],"firstName":"Lance","lastName":"Kaplan","id":"37271026000"},{"name":"Raghu Ganti","affiliation":["IBM Research, Yorktown Heights, NY"],"firstName":"Raghu","lastName":"Ganti","id":"37542291600"},{"name":"Shaohan Hu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Urbana, IL"],"firstName":"Shaohan","lastName":"Hu","id":"37072066100"},{"name":"Hengchang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Urbana, IL"],"firstName":"Hengchang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085392807"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2006-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1052-8725"}],"articleNumber":"6728876","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":259},"abstract":"This paper develops and evaluates algorithms for exploiting physical constraints to improve the reliability of social sensing. Social sensing refers to applications where a group of sources (e.g., individuals and their mobile devices) volunteer to collect observations about the physical world. A key challenge in social sensing is that the reliability of sources and their devices is generally unknown, which makes it non-trivial to assess the correctness of collected observations. To solve this problem, the paper adopts a cyber-physical approach, where assessment of correctness of individual observations is aided by knowledge of physical constraints on both sources and observed variables to compensate for the lack of information on source reliability. We cast the problem as one of maximum likelihood estimation. The goal is to jointly estimate both (i) the latent physical state of the observed environment, and (ii) the inferred reliability of individual sources such that they are maximally consistent with both provenance information (who claimed what) and physical constraints. We evaluate the new framework through a real-world social sensing application. The results demonstrate significant performance gains in estimation accuracy of both source reliability and observation correctness.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 34th Real-Time Systems Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel7/6724380/6728845/06728876.pdf","startPage":"212","endPage":"223","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 34th Real-Time Systems Symposium","doi":"10.1109/RTSS.2013.29","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTSS.2013.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6728845","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6728876","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploitation of Physical Constraints for Reliable Social Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Reliability","Silicon","Roads","Maximum likelihood estimation","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood estimation","social sciences computing","state estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliable social sensing","physical constraints","mobile devices","observations collection","physical world","cyber-physical approach","correctness assessment","source reliability","maximum likelihood estimation","latent physical state estimation","observed environment","provenance information","real-world social sensing application","estimation accuracy","observation correctness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["social sensing","physical constraints","maximum likelihood estimation","truth discovery"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6728876/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Exploitation of Physical Constraints for Reliable Social Sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6728876/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14064420","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","conferenceDate":"3-6 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploitation of Physical Constraints for Reliable Social Sensing","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"2006a212.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079253S","chronDate":"3-6 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6724380","isNumber":"6728845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6724380","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6728845","articleId":"6728876","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6728891,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Pei Wu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Zheng Pei","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085565289"},{"name":"Yogen Krish","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Yogen","lastName":"Krish","id":"37086652050"},{"name":"Rodolfo Pellizzoni","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Rodolfo","lastName":"Pellizzoni","id":"37282693900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2006-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1052-8725"}],"articleNumber":"6728891","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":780},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6728891","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Memory management","Real-time systems","Delays","Performance evaluation","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","embedded systems","multiprocessing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["worst case analysis","DRAM latency","real-time embedded systems","double data rate dynamic RAM","memory access latency","DDR devices","novel composable worst case analysis","improved latency bounds","multicore systems"]}],"abstract":"As multi-core systems are becoming more popular in real-time embedded systems, strict timing requirements for accessing shared resources must be met.

However, the performance of such controllers sharply decreases as DDR devices become faster and the width of memory buses is increased. In this paper, we present a novel, composable worst case analysis for DDR DRAM that provides improved latency bounds compared to existing works by explicitly modeling the DRAM state.

The focus is on deriving an automatable process for obtaining dynamic motor models that take nonlinear effects, such as saturation, into account. The modeling is based on finite element (FE) simulations for different current vectors in the$dq plane over a full electrical period. The parameters obtained are the stator flux in terms of the direct and quadrature components and the air-gap torque, both modeled as functions of the rotor angle and the current vector. The data are preprocessed according to theoretical results on potential harmonics in the targets as functions of the rotor angle. A variety of modeling strategies were explored: linear regression, support vector machines, symbolic regression using genetic programming, random forests, and artificial neural networks. The motor models were optimized for each training technique, and their accuracy was then compared based on the initially available FE data and further FE simulations for additional current vectors. Artificial neural networks and symbolic regression using genetic programming achieved the highest accuracy, particularly with additional test data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6729026/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14351622","volume":"61","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6729026/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using FE Calculations and Data-Based System Identification Techniques to Model the Nonlinear Behavior of PMSMs","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"LCM GmbH as a part of the COMET K2 program of the Austrian government"},{"fundingName":"Upper Austrian Government"},{"fundingName":"participating scientific and industrial partners"},{"fundingName":"Josef Ressel-Centre for Heuristic Optimization Heureka"},{"fundingName":"Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG)"},{"fundingName":"basic research program of the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using FE Calculations and Data-Based System Identification Techniques to Model the Nonlinear Behavior of PMSMs","sourcePdf":"tie-bramerdorfer-2303785-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125931S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6827271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6827271","articleId":"6729026","onlineDate":"30 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":6729030,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Yang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory for Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Yang","id":"38667435400"},{"name":"Guisheng Liao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory for Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Guisheng","lastName":"Liao","id":"37265079200"},{"name":"Shengqi Zhu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory for Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Shengqi","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37540158100"},{"name":"Xi Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085422851"},{"name":"Xuepan Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory for Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xuepan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38490783300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"6729030","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1381},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synthetic aperture radar","Sparse matrices","Radar polarimetry","Azimuth","Compressed sensing","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","image representation","image resolution","image sampling","matrix algebra","radar imaging","radar receivers","search radar","synthetic aperture radar","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SAR image resolution","undersampled data","matrix completion","compressive sensing","CS","signal redundancy","vector","MC","image sampling","measurement matrix","surveillance radar","data represention"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data recovery","low-rank matrix completion (MC)","synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging","undersampling"]},{"kwd":["Data recovery","low-rank matrix completion (MC)","synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging","undersampling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6729030","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2014.2300170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2014.2300170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6767065","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/6767065/06729030.pdf","startPage":"1539","endPage":"1543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAR Imaging With Undersampled Data via Matrix Completion","abstract":"High-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery of a wide area of surveillance is a difficult large-data problem. In the past few years, researchers have applied compressive sensing (CS) to SAR, as it exploits redundancy in signals. To further extend the sparse problem from the vector to the matrix, a new theory called matrix completion (MC) has attracted much attention, which can complete a matrix from a small set of corrupted entries based on the assumption that the matrix is essentially of low rank. Inspired by this technique, a novel SAR imaging algorithm is proposed in this letter to deal with the undersampled data. After representing the data of a range cell as a matrix, the phase is compensated to keep the matrix holding the property of low rank. Subsequently, MC can be utilized to recover the full-aperture data in the new constructed matrix. Since the data are completely unsampled in the corresponding azimuth cells, the proposed method has effectively conquered the restriction of previous applications that each received channel must have a small number of samples. The final results in both simulation and real-data experiments show that the targets can be well focused even in the scenario of discarding a large percentage of the received pulses. Moreover, when compared with CS, the method is not required to design the complicated measurement matrix.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6729030/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6729030/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14159352","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"SAR Imaging With Undersampled Data via Matrix Completion","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2010CB 731903"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61231017"},{"fundingName":"Aeronautic Fund","grantNumber":"20121081004"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAR Imaging With Undersampled Data via Matrix Completion","sourcePdf":"lgrs-yang-2300170-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050844S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"6767065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6767065","articleId":"6729030","onlineDate":"30 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":6729046,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries and the Research Center of Automation, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6827271/6729046/liu-2303781-small.gif","p":["\nQiang Liu (M'13) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from\nNortheastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2003, 2006, and 2013, respectively.","He is currently a Lecturer with the State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries,\nNortheastern University.

First, the CPLS-based process monitoring method is briefly reviewed. Second, a multiblock CPLS algorithm, which incorporates process block partition, is proposed to diagnose faults relevant to process inputs or outputs with a decentralized structure. For the CAP line application, tension-specific variations, roll-specific variations, and tension-roll covariations are analyzed in each partitioned block. Furthermore, within the roll-specific subspace of an abnormal block, a delay-alignment scheme based on strip transportation delay is proposed to diagnose defective processing materials.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6729046/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6729046/","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14351660","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multiblock Concurrent PLS for Decentralized Monitoring of Continuous Annealing Processes","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61304107, 61020106003, 61290323 and 61104084"},{"fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation funded project","grantNumber":"2013M541242"},{"fundingName":"International Postdoctoral Exchange Fellowship Program"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"N130408002"},{"fundingName":"Integrated Automation of Process Industry (IAPI) Fundamental Research Funds","grantNumber":"2013ZCX04 and 2013ZCX05"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiblock Concurrent PLS for Decentralized Monitoring of Continuous Annealing Processes","sourcePdf":"tie-liu-2303781-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085595S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6827271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"6827271","articleId":"6729046","onlineDate":"30 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-21"},{"_id":6729052,"authors":[{"name":"Pedram Ghamisi","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland"],"firstName":"Pedram","lastName":"Ghamisi","id":"37085397924"},{"name":"J\u00f3n Atli Benediktsson","affiliation":["Engineering Research Institute, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland"],"firstName":"J\u00f3n Atli","lastName":"Benediktsson","id":"38231866900"},{"name":"Gabriele Cavallaro","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland"],"firstName":"Gabriele","lastName":"Cavallaro","id":"37085500565"},{"name":"Antonio Plaza","affiliation":["Technology of Computers and Communications, University of Extremadura, Caceres, Spain"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Plaza","id":"37299689800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1939-1404"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-1535"}],"articleNumber":"6729052","dbTime":"112 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":85,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":992},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience & Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iron","Feature extraction","Hyperspectral imaging","Accuracy","Data mining","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","geophysical image processing","hyperspectral imaging","image classification","land cover","land use","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic spectral-spatial classification","hyperspectral images","spatial information","extended multiattribute profiles","supervised feature extraction","classification map","random forest classifier","CPU processing times","land-use mapping","land-cover mapping"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Extended Multi-Attribute Profile (EMAP)","hyperspectral image analysis","random forest classification","supervised feature extraction (FE)"]}],"abstract":"Supervised classification plays a key role in terms of accurate analysis of hyperspectral images. Many applications can greatly benefit from the wealth of spectral and spatial information provided by these kind of data, including land-use and land-cover mapping. Conventional classifiers treat hyperspectral images as a list of spectral measurements and do not consider spatial dependencies of the adjacent pixels. To overcome these limitations, classifiers need to use both spectral and spatial information. In this paper, a framework for automatic spectral-spatial classification of hyperspectral images is proposed. In order to extract the spatial information, Extended Multi-Attribute Profiles (EMAPs) are taken into account. In addition, in order to reduce the redundancy of features and address the so-called curse of dimensionality, different supervised feature extraction (FE) techniques are considered. The final classification map is provided by using a random forest classifier. The proposed automatic framework is tested on two widely used hyperspectral data sets; Pavia University and Indian Pines. Experimental results confirm that the proposed framework automatically provides accurate classification maps in acceptable CPU processing times.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Framework for Spectral\u2013Spatial Classification Based on Supervised Feature Extraction and Morphological Attribute Profiles","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2298876","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/6870503/06729052.pdf","startPage":"2147","endPage":"2160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2298876","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6870503","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6729052","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6729052/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Framework for Spectral\u2013Spatial Classification Based on Supervised Feature Extraction and Morphological Attribute Profiles","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6729052/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2014","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14501040","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Framework for Spectral\u2013Spatial Classification Based on Supervised Feature Extraction and Morphological Attribute Profiles","sourcePdf":"jstars-benediktsson-2298876-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05241S","chronDate":"June  2014","isNumber":"6870503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"85","articleId":"6729052","onlineDate":"30 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6729055,"authors":[{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Branke","affiliation":["Warwick Business School, University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/7024198/6729055/brank-2303783-small.gif","p":["J\u00fcrgen Branke (M\u201999) received the Ph.D. degree from University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany, in 2000","He is currently a Professor of operational research and systems with Warwick Business School, University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K. He has been an active Researcher in the area of nature-inspired optimization.

At regular intervals, the user is asked to rank a single pair of solutions. This information is used to update the algorithm's internal value function model, and the model is used in subsequent generations to rank solutions incomparable according to dominance. This speeds up evolution toward the region of the Pareto front that is most desirable to the user. We take into account the most general additive value function as a preference model and we empirically compare different ways to identify the value function that seems to be the most representative with respect to the given preference information, different types of user preferences, and different ways to use the learned value function in the MOEA. Results on a number of different scenarios suggest that the proposed algorithm works well over a range of benchmark problems and types of user preferences.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

the face. In this sense, a face image is just an observation and it should not be considered as the absolutely accurate representation of the face. As more face images from the same person provide more observations of the face, more face images may be useful for reducing the uncertainty of the representation of the face and improving the accuracy of face recognition. However, in a real world face recognition system, a subject usually has only a limited number of available face images and thus there is high uncertainty. In this paper, we attempt to improve the face recognition accuracy by reducing the uncertainty. First, we reduce the uncertainty of the face representation by synthesizing the virtual training samples. Then, we select useful training samples that are similar to the test sample from the set of all the original and synthesized virtual training samples. Moreover, we state a theorem that determines the upper bound of the number of useful training samples. Finally, we devise a representation approach based on the selected useful training samples to perform face recognition. Experimental results on five widely used face databases demonstrate that our proposed approach can not only obtain a high face recognition accuracy, but also has a lower computational complexity than the other state-of-the-art approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2014.2300175","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/6898047/06729058.pdf","startPage":"1950","endPage":"1961","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2014.2300175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6898047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data Uncertainty in Face Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6729058","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6729058/","displayDocTitle":"Data Uncertainty in Face Recognition","volume":"44","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14581871","pubMedId":"25222733","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6729058/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2012CB316400"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61125106, 91120302, 161370163, 61332011, 61263032 and 61233011"},{"fundingName":"Shaanxi Key Innovation Team of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"2012KCT-04"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Uncertainty in Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"tcyb-li-2300175-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108846S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"6898047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"6898047","articleId":"6729058","onlineDate":"30 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6729062,"authors":[{"name":"Paul C.

Along with these opportunities come challenges, particularly to service providers and operations centers that struggle to monitor and manage quality of service (QoS) for these services in order to meet customer service commitments. Traditional approaches fall short in addressing these challenges because they examine QoS from a limited perspective rather than from a system-of-systems (SoS) perspective applicable to a net-centric enterprise system in which any user from any location can share computing resources at any time. This paper presents a SoS approach to enable QoS monitoring, management, and response for enterprise systems that deliver computing as a service through a cloud computing environment. A concrete example is provided for application of this new SoS approach to a real-world scenario (viz., distributed denial of service). Simulated results confirm the efficacy of the approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6729062/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"14965217","htmlLink":"/document/6729062/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"System of Systems for Quality-of-Service Observation and Response in Cloud Computing Environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System of Systems for Quality-of-Service Observation and Response in Cloud Computing Environments","sourcePdf":"jsyst-hershey-2295961-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077969S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"7053977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7053977","articleId":"6729062","onlineDate":"30 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6729063,"authors":[{"name":"Sai Ho Yeung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, New York, USA"],"firstName":"Sai Ho","lastName":"Yeung","id":"37529101200"},{"name":"Alejandro Garc\u0131\u00b4a-Lamp\u00e9rez","affiliation":["Departmento de Teor\u0131\u00b4a de la Senal y Comunicaciones, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Leganes, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Alejandro","lastName":"Garc\u0131\u00b4a-Lamp\u00e9rez","id":"38271305800"},{"name":"Tapan Kumar Sarkar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, New York, USA"],"firstName":"Tapan Kumar","lastName":"Sarkar","id":"37276037000"},{"name":"Magdalena Salazar-Palma","affiliation":["Departmento de Teor\u0131\u00b4a de la Senal y Comunicaciones, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Leganes, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Magdalena","lastName":"Salazar-Palma","id":"37270550700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"6729063","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1643},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6729063","abstract":"This communication presents an alternate methodology- parasitically coupled feed-for exciting a four element microstrip array radiating primarily in the broadside direction.

In this study, the matching of the microstrip array and the radiation characteristics of the two different feeding mechanisms are simulated using an electromagnetic analysis code and then implemented in hardware for comparison of the performance of each mechanism. The microstrip line based array feed and the parasitically coupled feed both have similar bandwidth characteristics and radiate in the broadside direction with similar gains. The simulated efficiency of the proposed parasitically fed broadside array antenna is around 85% to 90% over majority of the bandwidth and compares well with the conventional direct feed structure.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Antenna measurements","Antenna radiation patterns","Feeds","Microstrip antenna arrays","Microstrip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","microstrip antenna arrays","microstrip lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parasitically coupled feed","direct coupled feed","microstrip antenna array","four element microstrip array","corporate feed network","T-junctions","quarter wave transformers","radiation characteristics","electromagnetic analysis code","microstrip line","array feed","bandwidth characteristics","broadside direction","parasitically fed broadside array antenna"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadside array antenna","microstrip antenna"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6809233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2014.2303823","startPage":"2813","endPage":"2818","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/6809233/06729063.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2014.2303823","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of the Performance Between a Parasitically Coupled and a Direct Coupled Feed for a Microstrip Antenna Array","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparison of the Performance Between a Parasitically Coupled and a Direct Coupled Feed for a Microstrip Antenna Array","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14267566","publicationDate":"May 2014","volume":"62","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2014","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6729063/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6729063/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of the Performance Between a Parasitically Coupled and a Direct Coupled Feed for a Microstrip Antenna Array","sourcePdf":"tap-yeung-2303823-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086859S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6809233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6809233","articleId":"6729063","onlineDate":"30 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6729067,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The proposed harmonic-suppressed MEFSSs consist of multiple metallic and dielectric layers. Each metallic layer is in the form of a two-dimensional arrangement of capacitive patches or an inductive wire grid with extremely sub-wavelength periods. Harmonic-free operation in these structures is achieved by using multiple, closely spaced capacitive layers with overlapping unit cells to synthesize a single, effective capacitive layer with a larger capacitance value. This allows for reducing the unit cell size of a conventional MEFSS considerably and moving the natural resonant frequencies of its constituting elements to considerably higher frequencies. Consequently, the spurious transmission windows of such MEFSSs, which are caused by these higher order harmonics, can be shifted to very high frequencies and an extremely broad frequency band free of any spurious transmission windows can be obtained. Using this technique, an MEFSS with a second-order bandpass response is designed to operate at 3.0 GHz with 20% fractional bandwidth and be free of spurious transmission bands up to 27.0 GHz. A prototype of this harmonic-free MEFSS is fabricated and experimentally characterized in the lab.

We have earlier presented a hybrid CMOS/nanotechnology reconfigurable architecture (NATURE). It uses the concept of temporal logic folding and fine-grain (i.e., cycle-level) dynamic reconfiguration to increase logic density by an order of magnitude. Since logic folding reduces area usage significantly, on-chip communications tend to become localized. To take full advantage of this fact, we propose a new architecture, called fine-grain dynamically reconfigurable (FDR), that consists of an array of homogeneous reconfigurable logic elements (LEs). Each LE can be arbitrarily configured into a lookup table (LUT) or interconnect or a combination of both. This significantly enhances the flexibility of allocating hardware resources between LUTs and interconnects based on application needs. The proposed FDR architecture eliminates most of the long-distance and global wires, which occupy most of the area in conventional FPGAs. Fine-grain dynamic reconfiguration is enabled by local embedded static RAM blocks. The experiments show that, on an average, area, delay, and power are improved by 9.14\u00d7, 1.11\u00d7, and 1.45\u00d7, compared with a conventional FPGA architecture that does not use the concept of logic folding. Compared with NATURE with deep logic folding, area, delay, and power are improved by 2.12\u00d7, 3.28\u00d7, and 1.74\u00d7, respectively. Although this does not eliminate the FPGA-ASIC area/delay/power gaps, it makes progress toward bridging these gaps.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fine-Grain Dynamically Reconfigurable Architecture Aimed at Reducing the FPGA-ASIC Gaps","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2294694","startPage":"2607","endPage":"2620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2294694","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6963544","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/6963544/06729082.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6729082","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6729082/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","displayDocTitle":"A Fine-Grain Dynamically Reconfigurable Architecture Aimed at Reducing the FPGA-ASIC Gaps","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"22","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6729082/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14760406","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-0719936 and CCF-1216457"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fine-Grain Dynamically Reconfigurable Architecture Aimed at Reducing the FPGA-ASIC Gaps","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-lin-2294694-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092916S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6963544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6963544","articleId":"6729082","onlineDate":"30 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6729084,"authors":[{"name":"Claudio Persello","affiliation":["Department of Empirical Inference, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6819879/6729084/perse-2300189-small.gif","p":["\nClaudio Persello (S'07\u2013M'11) received the Laurea (B.S.) and Laurea\nSpecialistica (M.S.) degrees in telecommunications engineering and the Ph.D. degree in communication and information\ntechnologies from the University of Trento, Trento, Italy, in 2003, 2005, and 2010, respectively.","He is currently a Marie Curie Research Fellow with the project \u201cMachine learning techniques for the analysis\nand classification of the last generation of remote sensing data,\u201d supported by the European Commission and the\nProvince of Trento.

Standard methods do not usually take into account the real annotation procedures and implicitly assume that all samples require the same effort to be labeled. Here, we consider the case where the cost associated with the annotation of a given sample depends on the previously labeled samples. In general, this is the case when annotating a queried sample is an action that changes the state of a dynamic system, and the cost is a function of the state of the system. In order to minimize the total annotation cost, the active sample selection problem is addressed in the framework of a Markov decision process, which allows one to plan the next labeling action on the basis of an expected long-term cumulative reward. This framework allows us to address the problem of optimizing the collection of labeled samples by field surveys for the classification of remote sensing data. The proposed method is applied to the ground sample collection for tree species classification using airborne hyperspectral images. Experiments carried out in the context of a real case study on forest inventory show the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2014.2300189","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/6819879/06729084.pdf","startPage":"6652","endPage":"6664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2014.2300189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6819879","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost-Sensitive Active Learning With Lookahead: Optimizing Field Surveys for Remote Sensing Data Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6729084","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6729084/","displayDocTitle":"Cost-Sensitive Active Learning With Lookahead: Optimizing Field Surveys for Remote Sensing Data Classification","volume":"52","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14331728","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6729084/","dateOfInsertion":"22 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Autonomous Province of Trento and the European Community"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-Sensitive Active Learning With Lookahead: Optimizing Field Surveys for Remote Sensing Data Classification","sourcePdf":"tgrs-persello-2300189-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127599S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6819879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6819879","articleId":"6729084","onlineDate":"30 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6729086,"authors":[{"name":"Shanhong You","affiliation":["Soochow University, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shanhong","lastName":"You","id":"37710407900"},{"name":"Chao Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Optical Communication Technologies and Networks, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Li","id":"38483148300"},{"name":"Qi Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Optical Communication Technologies and Networks, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37307122800"},{"name":"Ming Luo","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Optical Communication Technologies and Networks, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Luo","id":"38246808300"},{"name":"Ying Qiu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Optical Communication Technologies and Networks, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37085556012"},{"name":"Xiao Xiao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Optical Communication Technologies and Networks, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Xiao","id":"38521166300"},{"name":"Shaohua Yu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Optical Communication Technologies and Networks, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Shaohua","lastName":"Yu","id":"37715646900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"6729086","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":271},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"abstract":"We experimentally demonstrate a sub-band wavelength conversion scheme based on four-wave mixing in high-nonlinear fiber for multiple Tb/s-class superchannel coherent optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing networks.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is being increasingly used as a modality to detect prostate cancer. Therefore, computer-aided detection of prostate cancer in MRI images has become an active area of research. In this paper we investigate a fully automated computer-aided detection system which consists of two stages. In the first stage, we detect initial candidates using multi-atlas-based prostate segmentation, voxel feature extraction, classification and local maxima detection. The second stage segments the candidate regions and using classification we obtain cancer likelihoods for each candidate. Features represent pharmacokinetic behavior, symmetry and appearance, among others. The system is evaluated on a large consecutive cohort of 347 patients with MR-guided biopsy as the reference standard. This set contained 165 patients with cancer and 182 patients without prostate cancer. Performance evaluation is based on lesion-based free-response receiver operating characteristic curve and patient-based receiver operating characteristic analysis. The system is also compared to the prospective clinical performance of radiologists. Results show a sensitivity of 0.42, 0.75, and 0.89 at 0.1, 1, and 10 false positives per normal case. In clinical workflow the system could potentially be used to improve the sensitivity of the radiologist. At the high specificity reading setting, which is typical in screening situations, the system does not perform significantly different from the radiologist and could be used as an independent second reader instead of a second radiologist. Furthermore, the system has potential in a first-reader setting.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer-Aided Detection of Prostate Cancer in MRI","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2014.2303821","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/6803900/06729091.pdf","startPage":"1083","endPage":"1092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2014.2303821","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803900","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6729091","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6729091/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"Computer-Aided Detection of Prostate Cancer in MRI","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6729091/","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14251315","pubMedId":"24770913","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer-Aided Detection of Prostate Cancer in MRI","sourcePdf":"tmi-litjens-2303821-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104776S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"6803900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"197","xplore-issue":"6803900","articleId":"6729091","onlineDate":"30 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6729092,"authors":[{"name":"Colin D.

An evolutionary technique for them must answer two crucial questions to guarantee its success: how to distinguish among the different basins of attraction and how to safeguard the already discovered good-quality solutions including both global and local optima. In GCES, multimodal optimization problems are regarded as classification ones, and Gaussian mixture models are employed to save the locations and basins of already and presently identified local or global optima. A sequential estimation technique for the covariance of a Gaussian model is introduced into GCES. To best adjust the global step size, a strategy named top-ranked sample selection is introduced, and a classification method instead of a common but problematic radius-triggered manner is proposed. Experiments are performed on a series of benchmark test functions to compare GCES with the state-of-the-art multimodal optimization approaches. The results show that GCES is not only simple to program and understand, but also provides better and consistent performance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2298402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6815990","startPage":"1200","endPage":"1216","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/6815990/06729097.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gaussian Classifier-Based Evolutionary Strategy for Multimodal Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6729097/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6729097/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Gaussian Classifier-Based Evolutionary Strategy for Multimodal Optimization","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14365884","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"25","issue":"6","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF of China","grantNumber":"61170305 and 60873114"},{"fundingName":"NSF of USA","grantNumber":"CMMI-1162482"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gaussian Classifier-Based Evolutionary Strategy for Multimodal Optimization","sourcePdf":"tnnls-zhou-2298402-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079162S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6815990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6815990","articleId":"6729097","onlineDate":"30 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6729105,"authors":[{"name":"Amirkoushyar Ziabari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Birck Nanotechnology Center, Purdue University, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6932540/6729105/ziaba-2293422-small.gif","p":["Amirkoushyar Ziabari (M'13) received the bachelor's and first master's degrees in microelectronic circuits from Amirkabir and Sharif Universities, Tehran, Iran, and the second master's degree in semiconductor devices and nanoelectronics from the University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, USA.

Thus, accurate temperature information is a critical factor in chip design and verification. Conventional volume grid-based techniques, such as finite-difference and finite-element methods (FEMs), are computationally expensive. In an effort to reduce the computation time, we have developed a new method, called power blurring (PB), for calculating temperature distributions using a matrix convolution technique in analogy with image blurring. The PB method considers the finite size and boundaries of the chip as well as 3-D heat spreading in the heat sink. PB is applicable to both static and transient thermal simulations. Comparative studies with a commercial FEM tool show that the PB method is accurate within 2%, with orders of magnitude speedup compared with FEM methods. PB can be applied to very fine power maps with a grid size as small as 10 \u03bcm for a fully packaged IC or submicrometer heat sources in power electronic transistor arrays. In comparison with architecture-level thermal simulators, such as HotSpot, PB provides much more accurate temperature profiles with reduced computation time.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2293422","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/6932540/06729105.pdf","startPage":"2366","endPage":"2379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2293422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6932540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Blurring: Fast Static and Transient Thermal Analysis Method for Packaged Integrated Circuits and Power Devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6729105/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Power Blurring: Fast Static and Transient Thermal Analysis Method for Packaged Integrated Circuits and Power Devices","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6729105/","accessionNumber":"14686984","volume":"22","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Blurring: Fast Static and Transient Thermal Analysis Method for Packaged Integrated Circuits and Power Devices","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-ziabari-2293422-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108211S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6932540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6932540","articleId":"6729105","onlineDate":"30 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6729109,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohong Sun","affiliation":["Southeast University, National ASIC System Engineering Research Center, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohong","lastName":"Sun","id":"37534900100"},{"name":"Huai Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Huai","lastName":"Gao","id":"37420542300"},{"name":"G.

The method capitalizes on the high-quality SAS imagery whose high resolution permits many pixels on target. One particularly novel component of the method also detects sand ripples and estimates their orientation. The overall algorithm is made fast by employing a cascaded architecture and by exploiting integral-image representations. As a result, the approach makes near-real-time detection of proud targets in sonar data onboard an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) feasible. No training data are required because the proposed method is adaptively tailored to the environmental characteristics of the sensed data that are collected in situ. To validate and assess the performance of the proposed detection algorithm, a large-scale study of SAS images containing various mine-like targets is undertaken. The data were collected with the MUSCLE AUV during six large sea experiments, conducted between 2008 and 2012, in different geographical locations with diverse environmental conditions. The analysis examines detection performance as a function of target type, aspect, range, image quality, seabed environment, and geographical site. To our knowledge, this study-based on nearly 30 000 SAS images collectively covering approximately 160 km \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n of seabed, and involving over 1100 target detection opportunities-represents the most extensive such systematic, quantitative assessment of target detection performance with SAS data to date. The analysis reveals the variables that have the largest impact on target detection performance, namely, image quality and environmental conditions on the seafloor. Ways to exploit the results for adaptive AUV surveys using through-the-sensor data are also suggested.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/48/7005546/06729126.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"92","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2013.2294532","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2013.2294532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7005546","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6729126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Target Detection in Synthetic Aperture Sonar Imagery: A New Algorithm and Large-Scale Performance Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synthetic aperture sonar","Detection algorithms","Image quality","Sonar detection","Object detection","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","hydrological techniques","image representation","object detection","sand","seafloor phenomena","sonar imaging","synthetic aperture sonar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast target detection","synthetic aperture sonar imagery","large-scale performance analysis","unsupervised algorithm","underwater target detection","high-quality SAS imagery","sand ripple detection","through-the-sensor data","adaptive AUV surveys","seafloor","seabed environment","image quality","target type function","diverse environmental condition","geographical locations","large-sea experiments","MUSCLE AUV","mine-like targets","proposed detection algorithm","sensed data environmental characteristics","autonomous underwater vehicle","near-real-time target detection","integral-image representation","sand ripple orientation estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Algorithm","autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)","detection","mine countermeasures (MCM)","performance analysis","synthetic aperture sonar (SAS)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6729126/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Fast Target Detection in Synthetic Aperture Sonar Imagery: A New Algorithm and Large-Scale Performance Analysis","volume":"40","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6729126/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"14864001","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Target Detection in Synthetic Aperture Sonar Imagery: A New Algorithm and Large-Scale Performance Analysis","sourcePdf":"joe-williams-2294532-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099647S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"7005546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7005546","articleId":"6729126","onlineDate":"30 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6729128,"authors":[{"name":"Sayed Vahid Mir-Moghtadaei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6820808/6729128/6729128-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sayed Vahid Mir-Moghtadaei (M'98) was born in Isfahan, Iran, in 1972.

The UWB pulse is generated based on frequency up-conversion of the first derivative of the Gaussian pulse, which creates an adjustable null in the frequency spectrum. Simulation results show that employing the proposed pulse generator mitigates the mutual interference between UWB and WLAN systems, significantly. The proposed transmitter consists of a low frequency signal generator, an LC oscillator and a mixer, whose output directly drives the antenna using a matching on-chip transformer. Two control signals change the bandwidth and center frequency of the transmitted spectrum depending on the NB frequency and considering process, supply voltage and temperature (PVT) variations. A fast start-up circuit is used in the LC oscillator using current pulse injection and together with the mixer is duty cycled to reduce the power consumption. Post-layout simulation results show a null depth of 23 dB for a null bandwidth of 100 MHz. The energy/pulse and energy/pulse normalized to the output voltage amplitude are 14.4 pJ/pulse and 35.7 pJ/(pulse-V) from a 1-V supply for a pulse rate of 860 Mpulse/s with an active circuit area of only 0.18 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2013.2290849","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/6820808/06729128.pdf","startPage":"1836","endPage":"1848","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2013.2290849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6820808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 90 nm-CMOS IR-UWB BPSK Transmitter With Spectrum Tunability to Improve Peaceful UWB-Narrowband Coexistence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6729128","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6729128/","displayDocTitle":"A 90 nm-CMOS IR-UWB BPSK Transmitter With Spectrum Tunability to Improve Peaceful UWB-Narrowband Coexistence","volume":"61","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14331930","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6729128/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 90 nm-CMOS IR-UWB BPSK Transmitter With Spectrum Tunability to Improve Peaceful UWB-Narrowband Coexistence","sourcePdf":"tcsi-mirmoghtadaei-2290849-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075707S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6820808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6820808","articleId":"6729128","onlineDate":"30 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6729133,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Its main purpose is to find the contact points between the robotic hand and an object in order to grasp it efficiently. As the robotic hand has many degrees of freedom which induce a huge number of solutions, the search for the \u201cbest\u201d solution became an optimization problem. The search of such a solution is conducted by a grasp quality measurement which will be called the objective (or fitness) function. This paper proposes a Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) approach to tackle the grasp planning problem. Its fitness functions are based in two different grasp quality measurements. The MOPSO approach is then tested in HandGrasp simulator with simple objects. The results will be compared with two simple Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) approaches and demonstrate its performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICBR.2013.6729267","startPage":"120","endPage":"125","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Individual and Collective Behaviors in Robotics (ICBR)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBR.2013.6729267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6729252","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Individual and Collective Behaviors in Robotics (ICBR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720230/6729252/06729267.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization approach to robotic grasping","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6729267/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization approach to robotic grasping","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6729267/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14064920","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2014","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization approach to robotic grasping","confLoc":"Sousse, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"ICBR08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096894S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6720230","isNumber":"6729252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6720230","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6729252","articleId":"6729267","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6729271,"authors":[{"name":"Maram Alajlan","affiliation":["Research Unit of Sciences and Technology, Al-Imam Mohamed bin Saud University, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Maram","lastName":"Alajlan"},{"name":"Anis Koub\u00e2a","affiliation":["Cooperative Robots and Sensor Networks (COINS) Research Group, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Anis","lastName":"Koub\u00e2a","id":"37267806300"},{"name":"Imen Ch\u00e2ari","affiliation":["PRINCE Research Unit, University of Manouba (ENSI), Tunisia"],"firstName":"Imen","lastName":"Ch\u00e2ari","id":"38305642800"},{"name":"Hachemi Bennaceur","affiliation":["Research Unit of Sciences and Technology, Al-Imam Mohamed bin Saud University, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Hachemi","lastName":"Bennaceur","id":"38467293100"},{"name":"Adel Ammar","affiliation":["Research Unit of Sciences and Technology, Al-Imam Mohamed bin Saud University, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Adel","lastName":"Ammar","id":"37086197529"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2813-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6729271","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":505},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Path planning","Genetic algorithms","Sociology","Statistics","Biological cells","Mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","large-scale systems","mobile robots","path planning","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global path planning","mobile robots","large-scale grid environments","genetic algorithms","GA","large-scale grid maps","statistical evaluation","A* algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Global path planning is considered as a fundamental problem for mobile robots.

Experimental tests on Xilinx Virtex 5 ML507 proved the effectiveness of the proposed architecture since we have obtained a reduction of 85 % in execution time compared to initial MATLAB version developed on a PC platform.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6729272/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14064938","htmlLink":"/document/6729272/","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2014","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An FPGA based platform for real time robot localization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA based platform for real time robot localization","confLoc":"Sousse, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"ICBR15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047828S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6720230","isNumber":"6729252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6720230","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6729252","articleId":"6729272","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6729492,"authors":[{"name":"Shayok Chakraborty","affiliation":["Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, US"],"firstName":"Shayok","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"37401733400"},{"name":"Jiayu Zhou","affiliation":["Center for Evolutionary Medicine and Informatics, The Biodesign Institute"],"firstName":"Jiayu","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085790323"},{"name":"Vineeth Balasubramanian","affiliation":["School of Computing, Informatics and Decision Systems Engineering"],"firstName":"Vineeth","lastName":"Balasubramanian","id":"37409169100"},{"name":"Sethuraman Panchanathan","affiliation":["School of Computing, Informatics and Decision Systems Engineering"],"firstName":"Sethuraman","lastName":"Panchanathan","id":"37273597000"},{"name":"Ian Davidson","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis"],"firstName":"Ian","lastName":"Davidson","id":"37551844900"},{"name":"Jieping Ye","affiliation":["Center for Evolutionary Medicine and Informatics, The Biodesign Institute"],"firstName":"Jieping","lastName":"Ye","id":"37269201300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5108-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-4786"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8486"}],"articleNumber":"6729492","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1042},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrices","Prediction algorithms","Uncertainty","Matrix decomposition","Manuals","Equations","Collaboration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","learning (artificial intelligence)","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active matrix completion","matrix recovery","machine learning","data mining applications","human-in-the-loop","incomplete matrix reconstruction","query location","empirical analysis","human intelligence"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6729492","abstract":"Recovering a matrix from a sampling of its entries is a problem of rapidly growing interest and has been studied under the name of matrix completion. It occurs in many areas of engineering and applied science. In most machine learning and data mining applications, it is possible to leverage the expertise of human oracles to improve the performance of the system. It is therefore natural to extend this idea of \"human-in-the-loop\" to the matrix completion problem. However, considering the enormity of data in the modern era, manually completing all the entries in a matrix will be an expensive process in terms of time, labor and human expertise, human oracles can only provide selective supervision to guide the solution process. Thus, appropriately identifying a subset of missing entries (for manual annotation) in an incomplete matrix is of paramount practical importance, this can potentially lead to better reconstructions of the incomplete matrix with minimal human effort. In this paper, we propose novel algorithms to address this issue. Since the query locations are actively selected by the algorithms, we refer to these methods as active matrix completion algorithms. The proposed techniques are generic and the same frameworks can be used in a wide variety of applications including recommendation systems, transductive / multi-label active learning, active learning in regression and active feature acquisition among others. Our extensive empirical analysis on several challenging real-world datasets certify the merit and versatility of the proposed frameworks in efficiently exploiting human intelligence in data mining / machine learning applications.","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2013.69","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2013.69","startPage":"81","endPage":"90","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on Data Mining","pdfPath":"/iel7/6724379/6729471/06729492.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on Data Mining","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6729471","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active Matrix Completion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Active Matrix Completion","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6729492/","accessionNumber":"14078541","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6729492/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Matrix Completion","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"5108a081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074105S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6724379","isNumber":"6729471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6724379","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6729471","articleId":"6729492","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6729495,"authors":[{"name":"Barnan Das","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State University, Pullman, WA"],"firstName":"Barnan","lastName":"Das","id":"38003815200"},{"name":"Narayanan C.

Existing over sampling approaches for addressing this problem typically do not consider the probability distribution of the minority class while synthetically generating new samples. As a result, the minority class is not well represented which leads to high misclassification error. We introduce wRACOG, a Gibbs sampling-based over sampling approach to synthetically generating and strategically selecting new minority class samples. The Gibbs sampler uses the joint probability distribution of data attributes to generate new minority class samples in the form of a Markov chain. wRACOG iteratively learns a model by selecting samples from the Markov chain that have the highest probability of being misclassified. We validate the effectiveness of wRACOG using five UCI datasets and one new application domain dataset. A comparative study of wRACOG with three other well-known resampling methods provides evidence that wRACOG offers a definite improvement in classification accuracy for minority class samples over other methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6729495/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6729495/","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14078497","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"wRACOG: A Gibbs Sampling-Based Oversampling Technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"wRACOG: A Gibbs Sampling-Based Oversampling Technique","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"5108a111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086436S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6724379","isNumber":"6729471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6724379","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6729471","articleId":"6729495","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6729545,"authors":[{"name":"Buyue Qian","affiliation":["IBM T.

However, their accuracy is highly dependent on the abundance of training data. To address this limitation and reduce annotation efforts, the framework of active pair wise learning to rank was introduced recently. However, in such a framework the number of possible query pairs increases quadratic ally with the number of instances. In this work, we present the first scalable pair wise query selection method using a layered (two-step) hashing framework. The first step relevance hashing aims to retrieve the strongly relevant or highly ranked points, and the second step uncertainty hashing is used to nominate pairs whose ranking is uncertain. The proposed framework aims to efficiently reduce the search space of pair wise queries and can be used with any pair wise learning to rank algorithm with a linear ranking function. We evaluate our approach on large-scale real problems and show it has comparable performance to exhaustive search. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and validate the efficiency of hashing in accelerating the search of massive pair wise queries.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Databases","Uncertainty","Accuracy","Search problems","Artificial neural networks","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["file organisation","learning (artificial intelligence)","query processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast pairwise query selection","large-scale active learning","active pair wise learning","scalable pair wise query selection method","layered hashing framework","uncertainty hashing","search space reduction","algorithm ranking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active Learning","Hashing","Learning to Rank"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2013.54","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on Data Mining","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on Data Mining","pdfPath":"/iel7/6724379/6729471/06729545.pdf","startPage":"607","endPage":"616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6729471","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2013.54","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Pairwise Query Selection for Large-Scale Active Learning to Rank","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6729545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast Pairwise Query Selection for Large-Scale Active Learning to Rank","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6729545/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6729545/","accessionNumber":"14078470","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Pairwise Query Selection for Large-Scale Active Learning to Rank","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"5108a607.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102827S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6724379","isNumber":"6729471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6724379","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6729471","articleId":"6729545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6729605,"authors":[{"name":"Sejeong Kwon","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institue of Science and Technology, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Sejeong","lastName":"Kwon","id":"37086669225"},{"name":"Meeyoung Cha","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institue of Science and Technology, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Meeyoung","lastName":"Cha","id":"38186243400"},{"name":"Kyomin Jung","affiliation":["Seoul National University, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Kyomin","lastName":"Jung","id":"38192822100"},{"name":"Wei Chen","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37421821300"},{"name":"Yajun Wang","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, China"],"firstName":"Yajun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407543400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5108-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-4786"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8486"}],"articleNumber":"6729605","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":290,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3429},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prominent Features of Rumor Propagation in Online Social Media","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6729605","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electric shock","Pragmatics","Twitter","Mathematical model","Time series analysis","Psychology","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["social networking (online)","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rumor propagation","online social media","online social networks","temporal characteristics","periodic time series model","daily shock cycles","external shock cycles","structural differences","linguistic differences","rumor classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Rumor","Social Media","Time Series","Diffusion Network","Sentiment Analysis"]}],"abstract":"The problem of identifying rumors is of practical importance especially in online social networks, since information can diffuse more rapidly and widely than the offline counterpart.

When detecting communities, there are two possible sources of information one can use: the network structure, and the features and attributes of nodes. Even though communities form around nodes that have common edges and common attributes, typically, algorithms have only focused on one of these two data modalities: community detection algorithms traditionally focus only on the network structure, while clustering algorithms mostly consider only node attributes. In this paper, we develop Communities from Edge Structure and Node Attributes (CESNA), an accurate and scalable algorithm for detecting overlapping communities in networks with node attributes. CESNA statistically models the interaction between the network structure and the node attributes, which leads to more accurate community detection as well as improved robustness in the presence of noise in the network structure. CESNA has a linear runtime in the network size and is able to process networks an order of magnitude larger than comparable approaches. Last, CESNA also helps with the interpretation of detected communities by finding relevant node attributes for each community.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6729613/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6729613/","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2014","accessionNumber":"14078515","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Community Detection in Networks with Node Attributes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Community Detection in Networks with Node Attributes","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"5108b151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07378S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6724379","isNumber":"6729471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6724379","citationCount":"327","xplore-issue":"6729471","articleId":"6729613","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6729619,"authors":[{"name":"Evan R.

This paper proposes a new pan-sharpening method with sparse representation (SR) under the framework of wavelet transform. First, the wavelet transform is applied to the HRP image and the intensity component of LRM image. Then, the low-frequency components are fused based on SR to extract the spatial details in the HRP image as much as possible, and the dictionary is simply learned from high-quality nature images. Moreover, a novel strategy is also proposed to preserve the spectral information in the LRM image. On the other hand, the \u201cnumerous-but-sparse\u201d high-frequency components are merged based on the local wavelet energy, which makes the algorithm more efficient than traditional SR-based methods. Finally, the fused result is obtained by performing inverse wavelet transform and inverse IHS transform. Experiments on WorldView-2 images demonstrate that the proposed method gives more spatial details and less spectral distortion compared with some conventional methods in terms of both visual quality and objective measurements.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A practical pan-sharpening method with wavelet transform and sparse representation","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Imaging Systems and Techniques (IST)","doi":"10.1109/IST.2013.6729708","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Imaging Systems and Techniques (IST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6718310/6729646/06729708.pdf","startPage":"288","endPage":"293","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IST.2013.6729708","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6729646","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6729708","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6729708/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A practical pan-sharpening method with wavelet transform and sparse representation","conferenceDate":"22-23 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14078440","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A practical pan-sharpening method with wavelet transform and sparse representation","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"1569794929.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0784S","chronDate":"22-23 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6718310","isNumber":"6729646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6718310","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6729646","articleId":"6729708","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6729713,"authors":[{"name":"Yafan Xu","affiliation":["School of Instrumentation Science and Optoelectronics Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yafan","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085502984"},{"name":"Yan Zhao","affiliation":["School of Instrumentation Science and Optoelectronics Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37897007300"},{"name":"Falin Wu","affiliation":["School of Instrumentation Science and Optoelectronics Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Falin","lastName":"Wu","id":"37851786400"},{"name":"Kui Yang","affiliation":["School of Instrumentation Science and Optoelectronics Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kui","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085507610"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5791-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5790-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1558-2809"}],"articleNumber":"6729713","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":794},"abstract":"Currently the research in binocular stereo vision area mainly focuses on camera calibration and stereo matching. For camera calibration, to estimate the camera's parameters is of vital very importance for acquiring better three-dimensional positioning reconstruction accuracy. This research investigates camera calibration parameters for a binocular stereo vision system and their effects on system reconstruction accuracy. Three different types of parameters and their effects on system reconstruction accuracy are probed with a semi-physical simulation. Firstly, a mathematic model is established and the major sources of parameter errors are analyzed for measuring system. Secondly, a semi-physical simulation system is developed to analyze the effects of parameter errors on the system reconstruction accuracy in the binocular stereo vision system. The binocular stereo vision system is treated as a black box. Three types of parameter errors (i.e., errors of the distortion parameter, camera internal and external parameters) are selected as input variables of the black box, and corresponding system reconstruction errors are regarded as output variables. The effects on the system reconstruction accuracy are analyzed using results of simulation. Finally, correlations between each of the three parameter errors and the system reconstruction error are analyzed, and influence on accuracy of the system is given. The results show that distortion parameter error has a minimal impact on system reconstruction accuracy and belongs to secondary factor. The impact of internal parameter error on system reconstruction accuracy is slightly larger, and correlation of them is linear. The external parameter error directly determines system reconstruction accuracy by affecting baseline distance and the angle between cameras.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International

It is short for C-S. The weak scorch and the strong scorch represent different solar radiation. The weak scorch is so hard to extract that the radiation represented by the weak scorch always be neglected. The present methods reduce the accuracy of extraction, because these methods only extract the strong scorch and falsely treat the weak scorch as background. The RGB (red, green, blue) color image has more details of scorch than gray image, so a new method for scorch extraction based on the multivariable thresholding is proposed in this paper. The method segments the scorch with self-adaptive thresholds and optimizes the extraction with the amendatory coefficient, consequently, the robustness and accuracy of the algorithm is improved.","doi":"10.1109/IST.2013.6729732","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IST.2013.6729732","startPage":"410","endPage":"414","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Imaging Systems and Techniques (IST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6718310/6729646/06729732.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Imaging Systems and Techniques (IST)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6729646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A scorch extraction method for the Campbell-Stokes sunshine recorder based on multivariable thresholding","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A scorch extraction method for the Campbell-Stokes sunshine recorder based on multivariable thresholding","conferenceDate":"22-23 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6729732/","accessionNumber":"14064782","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6729732/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A scorch extraction method for the Campbell-Stokes sunshine recorder based on multivariable thresholding","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"1569806265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058175S","chronDate":"22-23 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6718310","isNumber":"6729646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6718310","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6729646","articleId":"6729732","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-01"},{"_id":6729773,"authors":[{"name":"Rayan AlShaalan","affiliation":["Deptartment of Electrical Engineering, King Saud University, Riyadh, Sadia Arabia"],"firstName":"Rayan","lastName":"AlShaalan","id":"37086764622"},{"name":"Basil AsSadhan","affiliation":["Deptartment of Electrical Engineering, King Saud University, Riyadh, Sadia Arabia"],"firstName":"Basil","lastName":"AsSadhan","id":"37392092000"},{"name":"Jalal Al-Muhtadi","affiliation":["Deptarpment of Computer Science, King Saud University, Riyadh, Sadia Arabia"],"firstName":"Jalal","lastName":"Al-Muhtadi","id":"38272605000"},{"name":"Hesham Bin-Abbas","affiliation":["King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) National, Technology Innovation Centers Program, Riyadh, Sadia Arabia"],"firstName":"Hesham","lastName":"Bin-Abbas","id":"38283630700"},{"name":"Fathi Abd El-Samie","affiliation":["KACST-TIC in RF and Photonics for the e-Society (RFTONICS), King Saud University, Riyadh, Sadia Arabia"],"firstName":"Fathi Abd","lastName":"El-Samie","id":"37086764638"},{"name":"Saleh Alshebeili","affiliation":["KACST-TIC in RF and Photonics for the e-Society (RFTONICS), King Saud University, Riyadh, Sadia Arabia"],"firstName":"Saleh","lastName":"Alshebeili","id":"37270333600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2569-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2568-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1949-4092"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1949-4106"}],"articleNumber":"6729773","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":173},"abstract":"With the rapid growth of communication technologies, the widespread use of the Internet, and the recent introduction of e-services, the number of computer network security threats is dramatically increasing. This paper presents an efficient method for anomaly detection in network traffic. In this method, network traffic is decomposed into control and data planes. As the data traffic generation is based on control traffic, the behavior of the two planes is expected to be similar during normal behavior. Therefore, detecting dissimilarity (via cross-correlation) between the traffic of the two planes can indicate an abnormal behavior. Constant and adaptive thresholding techniques have been developed in this paper for the design of a false alarm rate intrusion detection processors. Simulation experiments have been carried out on a real traffic obtained at King Saud University at the end of 2012.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 High Capacity Optical Networks and Emerging/Enabling Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720216/6729744/06729773.pdf","startPage":"141","endPage":"145","publicationTitle":"2013 High Capacity Optical Networks and Emerging/Enabling Technologies","doi":"10.1109/HONET.2013.6729773","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HONET.2013.6729773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6729744","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6729773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constant false alarm rate anomaly-based approach for network intrusion detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Computer crime","Ports (Computers)","Floods","Intrusion detection","Telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constant false alarm rate anomaly","network intrusion detection","communication technology","Internet","e-services","computer network security threats","anomaly detection","network traffic","data traffic generation","control traffic","constant thresholding technique","adaptive thresholding technique","false alarm rate intrusion detection processor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network traffic analysis","anomaly detection","intrusion detection systems","port scanning","TCP SYN flooding","CFAR"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6729773/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Constant false alarm rate anomaly-based approach for network intrusion detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6729773/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14064911","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2014","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constant false alarm rate anomaly-based approach for network intrusion detection","confLoc":"Magosa, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"paper24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069327S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6720216","isNumber":"6729744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6720216","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6729744","articleId":"6729773","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6729783,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this domain, design of efficient and robust MU-MIMO systems is a challenge for researchers. In this paper, we have proposed a new algorithm named as Layers Ordered Multiple Feedback Successive Interference Cancellation (LOMF-SIC). It is based on Spatial Multiplexed (SM), for uncoded MU-MIMO systems. Proposed algorithm has intrinsic novel idea that exploits the arranging layers according to the decreasing order of channel norm, SNR and SINR values of the received symbols. Arrangements of layers mitigate error propagation in the feedback loop and enhance BER performance. Furthermore, we have also proposed Division of Constellation Diagram (DCD) algorithm used to decide the reliability or unreliability of the detected symbols with low complexity. Simulation results are very encouraging and have shown that combination of our proposed algorithms has outperformed the existing techniques of SNR and channel norm. Simulation results have also shown that LOMF-SIC based on SINR has outperformed MF-SIC and conventional SIC methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Layers ordered multiple feedback successive interference cancellation in MU-MIMO","publicationTitle":"2013 High Capacity Optical Networks and Emerging/Enabling Technologies","doi":"10.1109/HONET.2013.6729789","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 High Capacity Optical Networks and Emerging/Enabling Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720216/6729744/06729789.pdf","startPage":"214","endPage":"218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HONET.2013.6729789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6729744","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6729789","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6729789/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Layers ordered multiple feedback successive interference cancellation in MU-MIMO","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6729789/","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14064887","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Layers ordered multiple feedback successive interference cancellation in MU-MIMO","confLoc":"Magosa, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"paper40.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045201S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6720216","isNumber":"6729744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6720216","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6729744","articleId":"6729789","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"}]
