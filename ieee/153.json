In this paper, we present some further justification for this type of representation, while addressing the issue of the specification of the best reconstruction space. We consider a realistic setting where a multidimensional signal is prefiltered prior to sampling and the samples corrupted by additive noise. We consider two formulations of the reconstruction problem. In the first deterministic approach, we determine the continuous-space function that minimizes a variational, Tikhonov-like criterion that includes a discrete data term and a suitable continuous-space regularization functional. In the second formulation, we seek the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation of the signal assuming that the input signal is a realization of a stationary random process. Interestingly, both approaches yield a solution included in some optimal shift-invariant space that is generally not bandlimited. The solutions can be made equivalent by choosing a regularization operator that corresponds to the whitening filter of the process. We present some practical examples that demonstrate the optimality of the approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1530014/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-14 Sept. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1530014/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8856910","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sampling in practice: is the best reconstruction space bandlimited?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling in practice: is the best reconstruction space bandlimited?","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"01530014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031763S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10242","isNumber":"32661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10242","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"32661","articleId":"1530014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1530031,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Nevertheless, this problem is present in a great number of applications as, for instance, ship detection from satellite radar imagery. Conventional algorithms for ship detection are conceived to discriminate an exceptionally bright localized pattern according to an established decision rule, expressed by the determination of a threshold. But the adjustment of thresholds involved in the decision step is complicated and relies on the existence of a considerable contrast between the vessels and the surrounding sea clutter which is not always reached. Thus, a novel method, based on the intrascale dependencies between wavelet coefficients in the different subbands, is proposed, justified and successfully tested on simulated and real images.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/10242/32661/01530031.pdf","startPage":"II","endPage":"221","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530031","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32661","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1530031","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel approach for the detection of punctual isolated targets by means of the wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Radar detection","Marine vehicles","Background noise","Multi-stage noise shaping","Shape","Satellites","Radar applications","Radar imaging","Spaceborne radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transforms","image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["punctual isolated targets detection","wavelet transform","isolated localized structure detection","satellite radar imagery","ship detection","localized pattern","sea clutter","wavelet coefficients"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1530031/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"A novel approach for the detection of punctual isolated targets by means of the wavelet transform","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1530031/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8845954","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","conferenceDate":"14-14 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel approach for the detection of punctual isolated targets by means of the wavelet transform","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"01530031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043388S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10242","isNumber":"32661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10242","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"32661","articleId":"1530031","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1530052,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In H.264, a brand-new international video coding standard, motion compensation can be performed by splitting macroblocks into multiple square or rectangular regions. In the proposed method, on the other hand, macroblocks or sub-macroblocks are divided into two regions (sliced blocks) by an arbitrary line segment. The result is that the shapes of the segmented regions are not limited to squares or rectangles, allowing the shapes of the segmented regions to better match the boundaries between moving objects. Thus, the proposed method can improve the performance of the motion compensation. In addition, adaptive prediction of the shape according to the region shape of the surrounding macroblocks can reduce overheads to describe shape information in the bitstream. The proposed method also has the advantage that conventional coding techniques such as mode decision using rate-distortion optimization can be utilized, since coding processes such as frequency transform and quantization are performed on a macroblock basis, similar to the conventional coding methods. The proposed method is implemented in an H.264-based P-picture codec and an improvement in bit rate of 5% is confirmed in comparison with H.264.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530052","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/10242/32661/01530052.pdf","startPage":"II","endPage":"305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A motion compensation technique using sliced blocks in hybrid video coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1530052","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1530052/","displayDocTitle":"A motion compensation technique using sliced blocks in hybrid video coding","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8835713","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1530052/","conferenceDate":"14-14 Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A motion compensation technique using sliced blocks in hybrid video coding","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"01530052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036661S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10242","isNumber":"32661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10242","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"32661","articleId":"1530052","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1530069,"authors":[{"name":"Caifeng Shan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Queen Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"lastName":"Caifeng Shan","id":"38559869600"},{"name":"Shaogang Gong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Queen Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"lastName":"Shaogang Gong","id":"37269431700"},{"name":"P.W.

Our approach is based on the simple local binary patterns (LBP) for representing salient micro-patterns of face images. Compared to Gabor wavelets, the LBP features can be extracted faster in a single scan through the raw image and lie in a lower dimensional space, whilst still retaining facial information efficiently. Template matching with weighted Chi square statistic and support vector machine are adopted to classify facial expressions. Extensive experiments on the Cohn-Kanade Database illustrate that the LBP features are effective and efficient for facial expression discrimination. Additionally, experiments on face images with different resolutions show that the LBP features are robust to low-resolution images, which is critical in real-world applications where only low-resolution video input is available.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530069","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/10242/32661/01530069.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32661","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530069","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","startPage":"II","endPage":"370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust facial expression recognition using local binary patterns","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1530069","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Robust facial expression recognition using local binary patterns","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1530069/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1530069/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8845881","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","conferenceDate":"14-14 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust facial expression recognition using local binary patterns","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"01530069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078455S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10242","isNumber":"32661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10242","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"32661","articleId":"1530069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1530073,"authors":[{"name":"Dahua Lin","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Dahua Lin","id":"37416122100"},{"name":"Yingqing Xu","affiliation":["Visual Computing Group, Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yingqing Xu","id":"37309067200"},{"name":"Xiaoou Tang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China","Visual Computing Group, Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xiaoou Tang","id":"37280008500"},{"name":"Shuicheng Yan","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Shuicheng Yan","id":"37272225300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9134-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"1530073","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tensile stress","Computer vision","Algebra","Computer graphics","Robustness","Lighting","Mathematical model","Least squares approximation","Asia","Face detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lighting","face recognition","tensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relighting","tensor-based factor decomposition","lighting condition","face synthesis","face analysis","computer vision","computer graphics","multilinear model","learning-based algorithm","two-stage decomposition scheme"]}],"abstract":"Lighting condition is an important factor in face analysis and synthesis, which has received extensive study in both computer vision and computer graphics.

In particular, we consider sets of 2-D Diracs and bilevel polygons. As opposed to using only sine or Gaussian kernels [I. Maravic et al, 2004], we allow the sampling kernel to be any function that reproduces polynomials. In the proposed sampling schemes, we exploit the polynomial approximation properties of the sampling kernels in association with other relevant techniques such as complex-moments [P. Milanfar et al, 1995], annihilating filter method [M. Vetterli et al, 2002], and directional derivatives. Specifically, for the bilevel polygons, we propose two different methods: the first uses a global reconstruction algorithm and complex moments, while the second is based on directional derivatives and local reconstruction algorithms. The trade-off between these two reconstruction modalities is also briefly discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530090","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530090","startPage":"II","endPage":"454","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/10242/32661/01530090.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling schemes for 2-D signals with finite rate of innovation using kernels that reproduce polynomials","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Sampling schemes for 2-D signals with finite rate of innovation using kernels that reproduce polynomials","conferenceDate":"14-14 Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1530090/","accessionNumber":"8835852","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1530090/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling schemes for 2-D signals with finite rate of innovation using kernels that reproduce polynomials","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"01530090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056007S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10242","isNumber":"32661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10242","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"32661","articleId":"1530090","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1530098,"authors":[{"name":"L.U.

To obtain these capabilities, an improved version of the altruistic vector quantization algorithm (AVQ) is proposed. The modified AVQ automatically evaluates the number of trajectory prototypes, and improves the representativeness of the prototypes themselves, so the visual events can be easily and accurately classified. Anomalous behaviors are detected if visual trajectories deviate from the self-learned representations of \"typical\" behaviors. The system has been implemented by means of standard PCs and TV cameras, and has been tested in many real outdoor contexts in different conditions (night and day). Currently it is used to monitor the storage areas of British Airways at the airport of Peretola (Florence, Italy), and some access gates of Autostrade per FItalia S.p.A. (the main Italian highways company). If the camera field-of-view is changed, the system automatically re-learns new \"typical\" behaviors and accurately detects anomalous events.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530123","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/10242/32661/01530123.pdf","startPage":"II","endPage":"586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A completely autonomous system that learns anomalous movements in advanced videosurveillance applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1530123","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1530123/","displayDocTitle":"A completely autonomous system that learns anomalous movements in advanced videosurveillance applications","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8835867","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1530123/","conferenceDate":"14-14 Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A completely autonomous system that learns anomalous movements in advanced videosurveillance applications","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"01530123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052573S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10242","isNumber":"32661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10242","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"32661","articleId":"1530123","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1530127,"authors":[{"name":"Zhouyu Fu","affiliation":["National Lab of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhouyu Fu","id":"37068927400"},{"name":"Weiming Hu","affiliation":["National Lab of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Weiming Hu","id":"37273481800"},{"name":"Tieniu Tan","affiliation":["National Lab of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Tieniu Tan","id":"37274122900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9134-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"1530127","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3544},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicle detection","Trajectory","Layout","Motion detection","Pattern recognition","Automation","Motion analysis","Information analysis","Video surveillance","Vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image motion analysis","pattern clustering","image classification","fuzzy set theory","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["similarity based vehicle trajectory clustering","anomaly detection","hierarchical clustering framework","vehicle motion trajectory classification","real traffic video","pairwise similarities","equal space intervals","spectral clustering","fuzzy K-means clustering"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we proposed a hierarchical clustering framework to classify vehicle motion trajectories in real traffic video based on their pairwise similarities.

Aliasing is a common problem present in such downsampling. In this paper a novel technique for improving the low pass filter for improved downsampling is presented. This method uses an extra update step followed by P+U lifting scheme. The preprocessing update step is chosen as the dual update step associated with the wavelet. The spatially adaptive low pass (SALP) filtering concept is used for the second update step, leading to an overall low pass filter whose size adapts to the underlying signal content. The filter choices for the second update step is recovered at the decoder without any bookkeeping. Results using the 2D 5/3 wavelet with the extra pre-processing update step show improvements over conventional wavelets.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530201","startPage":"II","endPage":"898","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/10242/32661/01530201.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing aliasing in wavelets based downsampling for improved resolution scalability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Reducing aliasing in wavelets based downsampling for improved resolution scalability","conferenceDate":"14-14 Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1530201/","accessionNumber":"8856943","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1530201/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing aliasing in wavelets based downsampling for improved resolution scalability","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"01530201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042377S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10242","isNumber":"32661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10242","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"32661","articleId":"1530201","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1530212,"authors":[{"name":"Dian Gong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing Sigma Center, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Dian Gong","id":"37551331200"},{"name":"Qiong Yang","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing Sigma Center, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Qiong Yang","id":"37288952500"},{"name":"Xiaoou Tang","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing Sigma Center, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xiaoou Tang","id":"37280008500"},{"name":"Jianhua Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jianhua Lu","id":"37278637500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9134-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"1530212","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":45},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Face recognition","Kernel","Robustness","Gabor filters","Statistics","Asia","Partitioning algorithms","Design optimization","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","microstructural gabor features extraction","directional block partitions","block-level directional projections","statistical kernels","mean kernel","variance kernel","classical down-sampling Gabor feature","BANCA dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Micro-structural Gabor feature","Face recognition","Statistical kernel"]}],"abstract":"Robustness and discriminability are two key issues in face recognition.

So far, the reported 3D face recognition techniques assume the use of active 3D measurement for 3D facial capture. However, active methods employ structured illumination (structure projection, phase shift, gray-code demodulation, etc.) or laser scanning, which is not desirable in many human recognition applications. A major problem of using passive stereo vision for 3D measurement is its low accuracy, and thus no passive methods for 3D face recognition have been reported previously. Addressing this problem, we have newly developed a high-accuracy 3D measurement system based on passive stereo vision, where phase-based image matching is employed for sub-pixel disparity estimation. This paper presents the first attempt to create a practical face recognition system based on fully passive 3D reconstruction.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530214","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/10242/32661/01530214.pdf","startPage":"II","endPage":"950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D face recognition using passive stereo vision","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1530214","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1530214/","displayDocTitle":"3D face recognition using passive stereo vision","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8845764","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1530214/","conferenceDate":"14-14 Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D face recognition using passive stereo vision","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"01530214.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052273S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10242","isNumber":"32661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10242","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"32661","articleId":"1530214","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1530215,"authors":[{"name":"Shan Du","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"lastName":"Shan Du","id":"37404611500"},{"name":"R.

To recognize faces under varying illuminations, we propose a wavelet-based normalization method so as to normalize illuminations.

It outperforms the conventional illumination normalization method - the histogram equalization that only enhances image pixel gray-level contrast in the spatial domain.

Recent worldwide growth of digital video applications such as home AV network or mobile multimedia have been demanding higher video compression ratio in order to meet system requirements due to limited bandwidth or storage capacity. Enhancement of temporal resolution using FRC at decoder side is attractive in a sense that the R-D performance can be maintained even at low bitrates by dropping frames during encoding process and recovering them at the decoder. The proposed FRC aims to provide accurate estimates of motion vectors for recovered frames based on compressed-domain information. The goal of our study is to realize a decoder design with robust FRC over a variety of implementation platforms from mobile to consumer set-top.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530220","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/10242/32661/01530220.pdf","startPage":"II","endPage":"974","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-cost video frame-rate up conversion using compressed-domain information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1530220","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1530220/","displayDocTitle":"A low-cost video frame-rate up conversion using compressed-domain information","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8835797","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1530220/","conferenceDate":"14-14 Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-cost video frame-rate up conversion using compressed-domain information","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"01530220.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045381S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10242","isNumber":"32661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10242","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"32661","articleId":"1530220","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1530284,"authors":[{"name":"B.U.

In addition to ordinary motion and color clues, flame flicker process is also detected by using a hidden Markov model. Markov models representing the flame and flame colored ordinary moving objects are used to distinguish flame flicker process from motion of flame colored moving objects. Spatial color variations in flame are also evaluated by the same Markov models, as well. These clues are combined to reach a final decision. False alarms due to ordinary motion of flame colored moving objects are greatly reduced when compared to the existing video based fire detection systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/10242/32661/01530284.pdf","startPage":"II","endPage":"1230","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32661","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1530284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flame detection in video using hidden Markov models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fires","Hidden Markov models","Layout","Motion detection","Frequency","Cameras","Monitoring","Smoke detectors","Robustness","Color"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flames","hidden Markov models","cameras","image motion analysis","image colour analysis","object detection","video signal processing","temperature sensors","smoke detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video flame detection","hidden Markov models","camera monitoring","flame flicker process","spatial color variations","flame colored moving object motion","video based fire detection systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1530284/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Flame detection in video using hidden Markov models","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1530284/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8845998","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","conferenceDate":"14-14 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flame detection in video using hidden Markov models","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"01530284.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039474S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10242","isNumber":"32661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10242","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"32661","articleId":"1530284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1530330,"authors":[{"name":"S.

However, when such areas are occluded in the majority of camera views, appearance information from other visible portions of the facade provides a critical cue to correctly complete the mosaic. In this paper we apply a robust measure of spread to infer whether a particular mosaic pixel is occluded in a majority of views, and introduce a novel spatiotemporal timeline-based inpainting algorithm that uses an additional motion cue in order to fill the texture map in majority-occluded regions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spatiotemporal phenomena","Buildings","Cameras","Filtering","Robustness","Image registration","Motion measurement","Particle measurements","Robot sensing systems","Robot vision systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image texture","cameras","median filters","filtering theory","image registration","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["texture map recovery","partially occluded building facades","moving camera","temporal median filtering","registered image mosaic","spatiotemporal timeline-based inpainting algorithm","majority-occluded regions"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530344","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/10242/32662/01530344.pdf","startPage":"III","endPage":"125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32662","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatiotemporal inpainting for recovering texture maps of partially occluded building facades","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1530344","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spatiotemporal inpainting for recovering texture maps of partially occluded building facades","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1530344/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1530344/","accessionNumber":"8845986","conferenceDate":"14-14 Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatiotemporal inpainting for recovering texture maps of partially occluded building facades","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"01530344.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06477S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10242","isNumber":"32662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10242","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"32662","articleId":"1530344","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1530350,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The HI kernel is proved to be positive definite and thus can be used in support vector machine (SVM) based recognition. Experimentally, it also leads to good recognition performances. However, its derivation applies only for binary strings such as color histograms computed on equally sized images. In this paper, we propose a new kernel, which we named generalized histogram intersection (GHI) kernel, since it applies in a much larger variety of contexts. First, an original derivation of the positive definiteness of the GHI kernel is proposed in the general case. As a consequence, vectors of real values can be used, and the images no longer need to have the same size. Second, a hyper-parameter is added, compared to the HI kernel, which allows us to better tune the kernel model to particular databases. We present experiments which prove that the GHI kernel outperforms the simple HI kernel in a simple recognition task. Comparisons with other well-known kernels are also provided.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530353","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/10242/32662/01530353.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32662","startPage":"III","endPage":"161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized histogram intersection kernel for image recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1530353","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Generalized histogram intersection kernel for image recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1530353/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-14 Sept. 2005","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8835678","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1530353/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized histogram intersection kernel for image recognition","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"01530353.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051465S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10242","isNumber":"32662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10242","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"32662","articleId":"1530353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1530356,"authors":[{"name":"N.H.

Previous works have focused primarily on using control grid interpolation (CGI) or over-lapped block motion compensation (OBMC) to reduce blocking artifacts. However, both methods generate distinct side effects, such as PSNR degradation or poor de-blocking results, during the de-blocking process. The main objective of our proposed model is to achieve better visual quality and maintain satisfactory coding efficiency simultaneously by integrating the advantages of CGI and OBMC. The introduction of the dual mode selection between CGI and OBMC provides a more flexible mechanism to adjust our objective function and thereby achieves higher objective and subjective coding gains. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves improved coding efficiency in terms of both PSNR and visual quality.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/10242/32662/01530365.pdf","startPage":"III","endPage":"209","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530365","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32662","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1530365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced motion compensation techniques for blocking artifacts reduction in 3-D video coding systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion compensation","Video coding","Filtering","Discrete wavelet transforms","PSNR","Degradation","Iterative algorithms","Information science","Mathematics","Information processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion compensation","video coding","data compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["advanced motion compensation techniques","artifacts reduction","3D video coding systems","control grid interpolation","overlapped block motion compensation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1530365/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Advanced motion compensation techniques for blocking artifacts reduction in 3-D video coding systems","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1530365/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8845645","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2006","conferenceDate":"14-14 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced motion compensation techniques for blocking artifacts reduction in 3-D video coding systems","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"01530365.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057408S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10242","isNumber":"32662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10242","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"32662","articleId":"1530365","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1530390,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This paper proposes a novel technique to combine demosaicing and denoising procedures systematically into a single operation by exploiting their obvious similarities. We first design a filter as if we are optimally estimating a pixel value from a noisy single-color image. With additional constraints, we show that the same filter coefficients are appropriate for CFA interpolation (demosaicing) given noisy sensor data. The proposed technique can combine many existing denoising algorithms with the demosaicing operation. In this paper, a total least squares denoising method is used to demonstrate the concept. The algorithm is tested on color images with pseudo-random noise and on raw sensor data from a real CMOS digital camera that we calibrated. The experimental results confirm that the proposed method suppresses noise (CMOS image sensor noise model) while effectively interpolating the missing pixel components, demonstrating a significant improvement in image quality when compared to treating demosaicing and denoising problems independently.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530390","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/10242/32662/01530390.pdf","startPage":"III","endPage":"309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32662","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1530390","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint demosaicing and denoising","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint demosaicing and denoising","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1530390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1530390/","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8835849","conferenceDate":"14-14 Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint demosaicing and denoising","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"01530390.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064888S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10242","isNumber":"32662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10242","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"32662","articleId":"1530390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1530416,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Our main contribution is to present a maximum likelihood based method to blindly separate the brain activations in an fMRI experiment. Choosing the time frequency domain as the signal representation space, our method relies on the second order statistics and exploits the inter-source diversity. It is efficiently implemented by the EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm where the time courses of the brain activations are considered as the hidden variables. The estimation variance of the STFT (short time Fourier transform) is reduced by averaging across time frequency sub-domains. The successful separation of the right and left visual cortex activations during a visual fMRI experiment, in a block design, and the extraction of only the relevant tasks corroborate the effectiveness of our proposed separating algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530458","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/10242/32662/01530458.pdf","startPage":"III","endPage":"581","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian blind source separation for brain imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1530458","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1530458/","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian blind source separation for brain imaging","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8836010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1530458/","conferenceDate":"14-14 Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian blind source separation for brain imaging","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"01530458.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049784S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10242","isNumber":"32662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10242","xplore-issue":"32662","articleId":"1530458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1530467,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The harmonic beamforming is then assessed in term of beam pattern, harmonic-to-fundamental ratio, and range resolution. The tuning of the parameters involved in the harmonic beamforming and the related effects are investigated.

In the SIS framework, estimation accuracy depends strongly on the choice of proposal distribution. In this paper we propose a novel SIS algorithm called PF-SP-PEKF that is based on a state partition technique and a parallel bank of extended Kalman filters designed to improve the accuracy of the proposal distribution. Our results show that this new approach yields a significantly improved estimate of the state, enabling the new particle filter to effectively track human subjects in a video sequence where the standard condensation filter fails to maintain track lock. Moreover, because of the improved proposal distribution, the new filter can achieve a given level of performance using fewer particles than its conventional SIS counterparts.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530532","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530532","startPage":"III","endPage":"876","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/10242/32662/01530532.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual tracking using sequential importance sampling with a state partition technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Visual tracking using sequential importance sampling with a state partition technique","conferenceDate":"14-14 Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1530532/","accessionNumber":"8856991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1530532/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual tracking using sequential importance sampling with a state partition technique","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"01530532.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046398S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10242","isNumber":"32662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10242","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"32662","articleId":"1530532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1530536,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In addition to employing forward error correction (FEC) codes, joint source-channel coding (JSCC) is a typical approach to combat the significant quality degradation. In this paper, a joint source-channel decoding (JSCD) method is designed when transmitting the JPEG2000 codestream over uncorrelated flat fading channels using low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Error resilience modes implemented in the JPEG2000 codec makes it possible to provide new messages as feedback to the channel decoder. Thus, the log-domain sum-product decoding procedure for LDPC codes is updated during each iteration according to the feedback information from the JPEG2000 decoder. Two adaptive modification algorithms are proposed to update the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) of the bit nodes at the receiver with and without channel side information (CSI), respectively. Simulation results show that the joint source-channel decoding methods not only improve the quality of the reconstructed image greatly but also reduce the number of iterations significantly.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Iterative decoding","Parity check codes","Transform coding","Image coding","Forward error correction","Feedback","Wireless sensor networks","Degradation","Design methodology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combined source-channel coding","fading channels","parity check codes","iterative decoding","adaptive codes","image reconstruction","image coding","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint source-channel decoding","JPEG2000 codestream transmission","flat fading channels","embedded codestream structures","progressive image compression methods","wireless channels","forward error correction codes","low-density parity-check codes","log-domain sum-product decoding","adaptive modification algorithms","log-likelihood ratio","channel side information"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32662","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530538","startPage":"III","endPage":"900","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/10242/32662/01530538.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530538","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint source-channel decoding for JPEG2000 codestream transmission over flat fading channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Joint source-channel decoding for JPEG2000 codestream transmission over flat fading channels","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8835819","publicationDate":"2005","isConference":true,"volume":"3","conferenceDate":"14-14 Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1530538/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1530538/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint source-channel decoding for JPEG2000 codestream transmission over flat fading channels","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"01530538.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05449S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10242","isNumber":"32662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10242","xplore-issue":"32662","articleId":"1530538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1530561,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Yeh Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Yeh Chen","id":"37280738200"},{"name":"Chao-Tsung Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan","National Taiwan University, Taipei, TW"],"lastName":"Chao-Tsung Huang","id":"37281275000"},{"name":"Yi-Hua Chen","affiliation":["Dept. of Electr.

However, the VBSME technique introduces excessive computations comparing to fix block size ones. In H.264/AVC, the possible macroblock partition modes can have up to 259 different combinations, which make the design of an efficient VLSI architecture for H.264/AVC a challenging task. Many VLSI designs for the general motion estimation modules were presented in past decades, and some of them were also implemented as commercial products.

This makes it possible to decode beyond the Guruswami-Sudan radius of 1 /spl radic/R for all rates less than 1/16. Stated another way, for any /spl epsiv/ > 0, we can list-decode in polynomial time a fraction of errors up to 1 - /spl epsiv/ with a code of length n and rate /spl Omega/(/spl epsiv//log(1//spl epsiv/)), defined over an alphabet of size n/sup M/ = n/sup O(log(1//spl epsiv/))/. Notably, this error-correction is achieved in the worst-case against adversarial errors: a probabilistic model for the error distribution is neither needed nor assumed. The best results so far for polynomial-time list-decoding of adversarial errors required a rate of O(/spl epsiv//sup 2/) to achieve the correction radius of 1 - /spl epsiv/. Our codes and list-decoders are based on two key ideas. The first is the transition from bivariate polynomial interpolation, pioneered by Sudan and Guruswami-Sudan [1999], to multivariate interpolation decoding. The second idea is to part ways with Reed-Solomon codes, for which numerous prior attempts at breaking the O(/spl epsiv//sup 2/) rate barrier in the worst-case were unsuccessful. Rather than devising a better list-decoder for Reed-Solomon codes, we devise better codes. Standard Reed-Solomon encoders view a message as a polynomial f(X) over a field F/sub q/, and produce the corresponding codeword by evaluating f(X) at n distinct elements of F/sub q/. Herein, given f(X), we first compute one or more related polynomials g/sub 1/(X), g/sub 2/(X), ..., g/sub M-1/(X) and produce the corresponding codeword by evaluating all these polynomials. Correlation between f(X) and g/sub i/(X), carefully designed into our encoder, then provides the additional information we need to recover the encoded message from the output of the multivariate interpolation process.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1530722/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2005","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1530722/","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8803105","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Correcting errors beyond the Guruswami-Sudan radius in polynomial time","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correcting errors beyond the Guruswami-Sudan radius in polynomial time","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"01530722.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102503S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10244","isNumber":"32664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10244","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"32664","articleId":"1530722","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1530724,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The question of characterizing codes that are locally testable is highly complex. In this work we provide a sufficient condition for linear codes to be locally testable. Our condition is based on the weight distribution (spectrum) of the code and of its dual. Codes of (large) length n and minimum distance n/2 - /spl Theta/(/spl radic/n) have size which is at most polynomial in n. We call such codes almost-orthogonal. We use our condition to show that almost-orthogonal codes are locally testable, and, moreover, their dual codes can be spanned by words of constant weights (weight of a codeword refers to the number of its non-zero coordinates). Dual-BCH(n, t) codes are generalizations of the well studied Hadamard codes (t = 1 is Hadamard). Alon et al. (2003) raised the question whether Dual-BCH(n, t) codes are locally testable for constant t. As these codes are known to be almost-orthogonal, we solve this question. We further show that BCH(n, t) code is spanned by its almost shortest words, that is by codewords of weight at most 2t + 2, while the minimum weight is 2t + 1. Our results can be straightforwardly extended to Goppa codes and trace subcodes of algebraic-geometric codes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1530724/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2005","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8803108","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1530724/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Almost orthogonal linear codes are locally testable","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Almost orthogonal linear codes are locally testable","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"01530724.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122762S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10244","isNumber":"32664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10244","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"32664","articleId":"1530724","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1530725,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Specifically, we show that a random walk on an expander approximates the recent Chernoff-like bound for matrix-valued functions of Ahlswede and Winter [2002], in a manner which depends optimally on the spectral gap. The proof uses perturbation theory, and is a generalization of Gillman's and Lezaud's analyses of the Ajtai-Komlos-Szemeredi sampler for real-valued functions [Gillman, 1993]. Derandomizing our sampler gives a few applications, yielding deterministic polynomial time algorithms for problems in which derandomizing independent sampling gives only quasi-polynomial time deterministic algorithms. The first (which was our original motivation) is to a polynomial-time derandomization of the Alon-Roichman theorem [Alon and Roichman, 1994]: given a group of size n, find O(log n) elements which generate it as an expander. This implies a second application - efficiently constructing a randomness-optimal homo-morphism tester, significantly improving the previous result of Shpilka and Wigderson [2004].

We show that oblivious transfer and bit commitment can be implemented in this model using protocols where honest parties need no quantum memory, whereas an adversarial player needs quantum memory of size at least n/2 in order to break the protocol, where n is the number of qubits transmitted. This is in sharp contrast to the classical bounded-memory model, where we can only tolerate adversaries with memory of size quadratic in honest players' memory size. Our protocols are efficient, non-interactive and can be implemented using today's technology.

To decide whether a formula in a logic with the tree-model property is satisfiable, one constructs an automaton that accepts all (or enough) tree models of the formula and then checks that the language of this automaton is nonempty. The standard approach translates formulas into alternating parity tree automata, which are then translated, via Safra's determinization construction, into nondeterministic parity automata. This approach is not amenable to implementation because of the difficulty of implementing Safra's construction and the nonemptiness test for nondeterministic parity tree automata. In this paper, we offer an alternative to the standard automata-theoretic approach. The crux of our approach is avoiding the use of Safra's construction and of nondeterministic parity tree automata. Our approach goes instead via universal co-Buchi tree automata and nondeterministic Buchi tree automata. Our translations are significantly simpler than the standard approach, less difficult to implement, and have practical advantages like being amenable to optimizations and a symbolic implementation. We also show that our approach yields better complexity bounds.","doi":"10.1109/SFCS.2005.66","publicationTitle":"46th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"46th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10244/32664/01530745.pdf","startPage":"531","endPage":"540","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SFCS.2005.66","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32664","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Safraless decision procedures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1530745","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1530745/","displayDocTitle":"Safraless decision procedures","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8803120","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1530745/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Safraless decision procedures","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"01530745.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0981S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10244","isNumber":"32664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10244","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"32664","articleId":"1530745","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":1530747,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Thus, it would seem possible that most programs of interest can be obfuscated even though in principle general purpose obfuscators do not exist. We show that this is unlikely to be the case. In particular; we consider the notion of obfuscation w.r.t. auxiliary input, which corresponds to the setting where the adversary, which is given the obfuscated circuit, may have some additional a priori information. This is essentially the case of interest in any usage of obfuscation we can imagine. We prove that there exist many natural classes of functions that cannot be obfuscated w.r.t. auxiliary input, both when the auxiliary input is dependent of the function being obfuscated and even when the auxiliary input is independent of the function being obfuscated. We also give a positive result. In particular; we show that any obfuscator for the class of point functions is also an obfuscator with independent auxiliary input.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32664","publicationTitle":"46th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"46th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10244/32664/01530747.pdf","doi":"10.1109/SFCS.2005.60","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SFCS.2005.60","startPage":"553","endPage":"562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the impossibility of obfuscation with auxiliary input","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1530747/","displayDocTitle":"On the impossibility of obfuscation with auxiliary input","htmlLink":"/document/1530747/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2005","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"8803122","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","publicationDate":"2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the impossibility of obfuscation with auxiliary input","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"01530747.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090665S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10244","isNumber":"32664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10244","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"32664","articleId":"1530747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1530751,"authors":[{"name":"R.

We show that for packing domains, any /spl alpha/-approximation algorithm that also bounds the integrality gap of the IF relaxation of the problem by a can be used to construct an /spl alpha/-approximation mechanism that is truthful in expectation. This immediately yields a variety of new and significantly improved results for various problem domains and furthermore, yields truthful (in expectation) mechanisms with guarantees that match the best known approximation guarantees when truthfulness is not required. In particular, we obtain the first truthful mechanisms with approximation guarantees for a variety of multi-parameter domains. We obtain truthful (in expectation) mechanisms achieving approximation guarantees of O(/spl radic/m) for combinatorial auctions (CAs), (1 + /spl epsi/ ) for multiunit CAs with B = /spl Omega/(log m) copies of each item, and 2 for multiparameter knapsack problems (multiunit auctions). Our construction is based on considering an LP relaxation of the problem and using the classic VCG mechanism by W. Vickrey (1961), E. Clarke (1971) and T. Groves (1973) to obtain a truthful mechanism in this fractional domain. We argue that the (fractional) optimal solution scaled down by a, where a is the integrality gap of the problem, can be represented as a convex combination of integer solutions, and by viewing this convex combination as specifying a probability distribution over integer solutions, we get a randomized, truthful in expectation mechanism. Our construction can be seen as a way of exploiting VCG in a computational tractable way even when the underlying social-welfare maximization problem is NP-hard.","displayPublicationTitle":"46th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10244/32664/01530751.pdf","startPage":"595","endPage":"604","publicationTitle":"46th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS'05)","doi":"10.1109/SFCS.2005.76","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SFCS.2005.76","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32664","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1530751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Truthful and near-optimal mechanism design via linear programming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear programming","Approximation algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Content addressable storage","Pricing","Probability distribution","Mathematics","Mechanical factors","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear programming","commerce","knapsack problems","computational complexity","combinatorial mathematics","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["truthful mechanism design","near-optimal mechanism design","linear programming","/spl alpha/-approximation algorithm","IF relaxation","combinatorial auctions","multiparameter knapsack problems","LP relaxation","probability distribution","expectation mechanism","social-welfare maximization problem","NP-hardness"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1530751/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Truthful and near-optimal mechanism design via linear programming","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1530751/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8803125","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Truthful and near-optimal mechanism design via linear programming","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"01530751.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083705S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10244","isNumber":"32664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10244","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"32664","articleId":"1530751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1530811,"authors":[{"name":"J.T.E.

Their performance (speed, consumption, alterability, nonvolatility) and the increasing importance of system reconfigurability push for flash memory integration in SoC. Unfortunately, flash integration introduces new issues both at system and at circuit/technology levels that need to be deeply investigated. From the system point of view, several aspects are involved in the choice of the flash memory type to be integrated in SoC: the most important ones, depending on the specific applications and requirements (cost, power consumption, reliability and performance requirements), are illustrated. Also circuit-technology issues specific to flash integration with high-speed logic are discussed in depth by analyzing the real case of an embedded 1-T NOR flash memory.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1530918/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1530918/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8652230","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2005","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Flash memories for SoC: an overview on system constraints and technology issues","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flash memories for SoC: an overview on system constraints and technology issues","confLoc":"Banff, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"01530918.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.25485S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10246","isNumber":"32666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10246","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"32666","articleId":"1530918","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1530933,"authors":[{"name":"R.B.

As the amount of transistors on a chip continues to increase, so does the possibility to integrate more functionality onto every chip. By combining general-purpose and application-specific hardware, it is possible to integrate the complete baseband part of a 3G base station on a single chip. Such a single-chip base station has been modeled from a communication perspective without full implementations of the processing elements. The system has been scheduled and implemented as a traffic model for a network on chip simulator. Simulation results show perfect adherence to the schedule already at a network clock frequency of 75 MHz. The overall network usage is relatively low except for the area closest to the radio interfaces. This allows for other messages, e.g. control related, to be transported over the network during the gaps in the communication schedule.","doi":"10.1109/IWSOC.2005.50","publicationTitle":"Fifth International Workshop on System-on-Chip for Real-Time Applications (IWSOC'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth International Workshop on System-on-Chip for Real-Time Applications (IWSOC'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10246/32666/01530952.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWSOC.2005.50","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32666","startPage":"252","endPage":"256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design, mapping, and simulations of a 3G WCDMA/FDD base station using network on chip","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1530952","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design, mapping, and simulations of a 3G WCDMA/FDD base station using network on chip","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1530952/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8660862","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1530952/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design, mapping, and simulations of a 3G WCDMA/FDD base station using network on chip","confLoc":"Banff, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"01530952.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040146S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10246","isNumber":"32666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10246","xplore-issue":"32666","articleId":"1530952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1530958,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In this work, we present a distributed method for combinational test generation. The method is based on a hybrid approach that combines both deterministic and genetic approaches. The deterministic phase is based on the D-algorithm and generates an initial set of test vectors that are evolved in the genetic phase in order to achieve high fault coverage in a short time. The algorithm is parallelized based on a cluster of workstations using the message passing interface (MPI) library. Several benchmark circuits were attempted, and favorable results comparisons are reported.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1530964/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8660869","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1530964/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A hybrid distributed test generation method using deterministic and genetic algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid distributed test generation method using deterministic and genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Banff, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"01530964.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075445S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10246","isNumber":"32666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10246","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"32666","articleId":"1530964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1530976,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-Ho Seo","affiliation":["Information and Communications University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sang-Ho Seo","id":"37287869700"},{"name":"Sin-Chong Park","affiliation":["Information and Communications University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sin-Chong Park","id":"37280888000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2403-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1530976","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Viterbi algorithm","Energy consumption","Read-write memory","Maximum likelihood decoding","Algorithm design and analysis","Equations","Writing","Cost function","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Viterbi decoding","maximum likelihood decoding","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["register exchanged state-mapping algorithm","Viterbi decoder","memory bank","trace back operation","latency reduction","power consumption","resource usage"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new implementation of the Viterbi decoder is proposed.

The resource usage is 74% smaller than the RE algorithm, and the latency is 34% smaller than the k-pointer even TB algorithm. The power consumption of each algorithm are also analyzed and compared. Because the resource usage is directly related to the power, the power consumption of this scheme is also reduced as stated in D. Liu and C. Svensson (1994).

Among the most popular hash functions are MD5, SHA-1, and RIPEMD-160 that are used in conjunction with HMAC for IPSec. These three hash functions are based on an older one, MD4. Therefore, they have some similarities that can be exploited for designing a unified engine to perform the three hash functions. A unified engine design proves useful since the three algorithms are to be used by same implementation on the same core for authentication and data integrity using HMAC for IPSec. In this work, we design a SoC with a unified hash engine that can be reconfigured at runtime to perform one of the three hash functions. The results of our work show that the proposed engine has a balance between area and throughput compared to previous works.","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth International Workshop on System-on-Chip for Real-Time Applications (IWSOC'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10246/32666/01530989.pdf","startPage":"450","endPage":"453","publicationTitle":"Fifth International Workshop on System-on-Chip for Real-Time Applications (IWSOC'05)","doi":"10.1109/IWSOC.2005.41","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWSOC.2005.41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32666","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1530989","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA design of a unified hash engine for IPSec authentication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Engines","Authentication","Cryptography","Data security","Algorithm design and analysis","Electrostatic precipitators","Computer security","Runtime","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","message authentication","data integrity","field programmable gate arrays","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA design","unified hash engine","IPSec authentication","hash functions","data integrity","MD5","SHA-1","RIPEMD-160","HMAC","field programmable gate arrays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1530989/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA design of a unified hash engine for IPSec authentication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1530989/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8660887","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA design of a unified hash engine for IPSec authentication","confLoc":"Banff, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"01530989.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055977S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10246","isNumber":"32666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10246","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"32666","articleId":"1530989","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1530994,"authors":[{"name":"K.A.

The clinical view suggests a process that first gathers an individual's goals, assesses the individual's abilities, delivers a tailored system, and finally, monitors usage over time to look for adaptation needs. One concept that has arisen from our project is the notion of a deferred requirement (or deferred goal). Professional clinicians ask an individual to think broadly of the goals they have, and think about not only goals that are achievable today, but ones that might be striven for and become achieved in the future. We discuss this idea of deferred requirements in terms of a longitudinal study working with nine participants over a two year period. We also report on initial attempts to build automated tools around deferred requirements, monitoring, and system adaptation.","doi":"10.1109/RE.2005.70","publicationTitle":"13th IEEE International Conference on Requirements Engineering (RE'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"13th IEEE International Conference on Requirements Engineering (RE'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10247/32667/01531036.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RE.2005.70","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32667","startPage":"145","endPage":"154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The role of deferred requirements in a longitudinal study of emailing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1531036","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The role of deferred requirements in a longitudinal study of emailing","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1531036/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8732833","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1531036/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The role of deferred requirements in a longitudinal study of emailing","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"01531036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.215102S","chronDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10247","isNumber":"32667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10247","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"32667","articleId":"1531036","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1531067,"authors":[{"name":"L.

For example, the future development steps of the off-the-shelf products cannot be negotiated with just one or a few customers any more. This means that practitioners should be able to take aspects such as their company's own strategy and available market information more effectively into account in such decision-making. However, usually the company or business unit strategy is so high level that the gap to single requirements documents is far too long. Roadmapping is one technique that companies have used for long-term product planning in order to link the business view to requirements engineering (RE), and to make more business oriented product development decisions. In addition, roadmapping has been used to share a common understanding about the future development steps of products with different stakeholders. However, the application of the technique is not always easy. This paper gives an overview of roadmapping as a technique, and describes lessons learned from one Finnish software product company that has developed and evaluated its own roadmapping processes in their organization.","doi":"10.1109/RE.2005.36","publicationTitle":"13th IEEE International Conference on Requirements Engineering (RE'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"13th IEEE International Conference on Requirements Engineering (RE'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10247/32667/01531067.pdf","startPage":"439","endPage":"443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RE.2005.36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32667","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linking the business view to requirements engineering: long-term product planning by roadmapping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1531067","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1531067/","displayDocTitle":"Linking the business view to requirements engineering: long-term product planning by roadmapping","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8732864","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1531067/","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linking the business view to requirements engineering: long-term product planning by roadmapping","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"01531067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050059S","chronDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10247","isNumber":"32667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10247","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"32667","articleId":"1531067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1531102,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng-De Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Sheng-De Wang","id":"37280449700"},{"name":"I-Tar Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"I-Tar Hsu","id":"37563853900"},{"name":"Zheng-Yi Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Zheng-Yi Huang","id":"37555443400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2281-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1521-9097"}],"articleNumber":"1531102","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1531102","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dynamic scheduling","Grid computing","Processor scheduling","Distributed computing","Application software","Councils","Computer applications","Delay","Parallel processing","Biological system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grid computing","processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic scheduling","grid computing","most fit task first","computational grid environment","adaptive scheduling","heterogeneous computing","static scheduling"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose an adaptive and dynamic scheduling method, called most fit task first (MFTF), for a class of computational grids, which are characterized by heterogeneous computing nodes and dynamic task arrivals.

The heterogeneity comes not only from processor performances but also from network topology and communication performances. It is essential to take into account the heterogeneity to derive the maximum benefit from such computing environments. In this research, we show the impact of considering such heterogeneity based on molecular dynamics (MD) with spatial decomposition method. We coordinate with complicated communication patterns caused from spatial decomposition of irregular data by using a newly developed graph mapping method. Previous researches on graph mapping have dealt with network heterogeneity by weighted edge-cut. However, the cost function ignores interference between communications and it is not proper estimation of communication time. Meanwhile, our method considers per-link bandwidths for correct estimation of communication time. In our experiments, the mappings derived by the proposed method reduced the communication completion times up to 20% and up to 60% with relayed communication.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network-aware data mapping on parallel molecular dynamics","publicationTitle":"11th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS'05)","doi":"10.1109/ICPADS.2005.203","displayPublicationTitle":"11th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10248/32668/01531117.pdf","startPage":"126","endPage":"132 Vol. 1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS.2005.203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32668","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1531117","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1531117/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Network-aware data mapping on parallel molecular dynamics","conferenceDate":"20-22 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1531117/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8660531","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network-aware data mapping on parallel molecular dynamics","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"01531117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070542S","chronDate":"20-22 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10248","isNumber":"32668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10248","xplore-issue":"32668","articleId":"1531117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1531175,"authors":[{"name":"Bih-Hwang Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Bih-Hwang Lee","id":"37337172800"},{"name":"Hsin-Pei Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hsin-Pei Chen","id":"37560129100"},{"name":"Su-Shun Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Su-Shun Huang","id":"37557767100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2281-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1521-9097"}],"articleNumber":"1531175","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":38},"abstract":"In mobile communication environment, an abrupt increase of mobile users in a specific cell makes traffic overloaded and become a so-called hot-spot cell, which causes an unbalanced traffic load condition because the traffic load in the neighboring cells may be light. In order to utilize a limited bandwidth efficiently, it is necessary to use a good mobile handoff strategy to alleviate the unbalanced traffic condition. This paper proposes a complete traffic shedding algorithm (CTSA) for soft handoff efficiently to alleviate the overloaded traffic in the hot-spot cell by adjusting handoff parameters, which virtually reduces the service coverage of the heavy loaded cell without adjusting the transmission power. The mobile users located in the outer area of the hot-spot cell is early handoff to the neighboring cells with light traffic load; and the mobile users in the neighboring cells postpone to handoff to the hot-spot cell, so that the traffic load of the hot-spot cell can be decreased. The proposed algorithm is analyzed and evaluated by simulation; CTSA algorithm shows better performance than the others; it obviously increases system throughput and decreases soft handoff call dropping ratio, and new call blocking ratio.","displayPublicationTitle":"11th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10248/32668/01531175.pdf","startPage":"530","endPage":"535 Vol. 1","publicationTitle":"11th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS'05)","doi":"10.1109/ICPADS.2005.96","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS.2005.96","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32668","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1531175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A traffic shedding algorithm for soft-handoff in MC-CDMA systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicarrier code division multiple access","Telecommunication traffic","Multiaccess communication","Mobile communication","Bandwidth","Performance analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Analytical models","Throughput","Traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile communication","code division multiple access","telecommunication congestion control","mobile computing","telecommunication traffic","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft-handoff","MC-CDMA system","mobile communication environment","mobile user","hot-spot cell","traffic load","mobile handoff strategy","complete traffic shedding algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1531175/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"A traffic shedding algorithm for soft-handoff in MC-CDMA systems","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1531175/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8660580","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","conferenceDate":"20-22 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A traffic shedding algorithm for soft-handoff in MC-CDMA systems","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"01531175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047932S","chronDate":"20-22 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10248","isNumber":"32668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10248","xplore-issue":"32668","articleId":"1531175","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1531192,"authors":[{"name":"M.

For multimedia applications, the routing algorithms should consider many quality of service (QoS) parameters such as delay, cost and so on to find a new route. However, to find routes with two or more QoS parameters is a NP-hard problem. Therefore, many researchers are trying to use heuristic methods such as genetic algorithm (GA) to find good routes satisfying application request. In a previous work, a QoS multicast routing based on GA was proposed. The routing algorithm uses as QoS parameters for multicasting the delay and cost. However, in this algorithm, the multicast routing falls in the local minimum and can not satisfy the application requirement. In this paper, we propose a new QoS multicast routing protocol which has better genetic operations than the conventional algorithm, resulting in a better search success ratio and computation time compared with the conventional algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICPADS.2005.36","startPage":"655","endPage":"660 Vol. 1","publicationTitle":"11th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS'05)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS.2005.36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32668","displayPublicationTitle":"11th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10248/32668/01531193.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new quality of service multicast routing protocol based on genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1531193/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A new quality of service multicast routing protocol based on genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1531193/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8660593","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","conferenceDate":"20-22 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 July 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new quality of service multicast routing protocol based on genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"01531193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046485S","chronDate":"20-22 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10248","isNumber":"32668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10248","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"32668","articleId":"1531193","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1531265,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Wu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Jian Wu","id":"37404829500"},{"name":"Zhaohui Wu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Zhaohui Wu","id":"37278598300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2408-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1531265","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":561},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Web services","Microstrip","Simple object access protocol","Educational institutions","Computer science","Software agents","Ontologies","Costs","Application software","Web and internet services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semantic Web","software agents","ontologies (artificial intelligence)","search engines","specification languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semantic Web service matchmaking","WSDL","universal description standard","discovery standard","integration standard","UDDI registers","keyword-based search","category-based keyword-browsing method","software agents","search engines","ontologies","reasoning algorithm","similarity assessment method"]}],"abstract":"With the increasing growth in popularity of Web services, matchmaking of relevant Web services becomes a significant challenge. Commonly, Web service is described by WSDL and published on UDDI registers. UDDI provides limited search facilities allowing only a keyword-based search of businesses, services, and the so called tModels based on names and identifiers. This category-based keyword-browsing method is clearly insufficient. Semantic Web service uses DAML-S instead of WSDL to represent capabilities of Web services. This improvement enables software agents or search engines to automatically find appropriate Web services via ontologies and reasoning algorithm enriched methods. However, the high cost of formally defining to the heavy and complicated services makes this improvement widespread adoption unlikely. To cope with these limitations, we have developed a suite of methods which assesses the similarity of Web services to achieve matchmaking. In particular, we present a conceptual model which classifies properties of Web services into four categories. For each category, a similarity assessment method has been given. In Web service matchmaking process, these similarity assessment methods can be used together or individually. Experiments highlight complementary contributions that our work makes to facilitate Web service matchmaking.","doi":"10.1109/SCC.2005.93","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC'05) Vol-1","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC'05) Vol-1","pdfPath":"/iel5/10249/32669/01531265.pdf","startPage":"287","endPage":"294 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCC.2005.93","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Similarity-based Web service matchmaking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1531265","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1531265/","displayDocTitle":"Similarity-based Web service matchmaking","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670018","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1531265/","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2005","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Similarity-based Web service matchmaking","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"01531265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070411S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10249","isNumber":"32669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10249","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"32669","articleId":"1531265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1531306,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This novel digital control treats BLDC motor as a digital system and regulates speed with the help of two predefined state variables, state-1 designed for high-speed operation and state-2 defined for low-speed operation. A comparator compares actual speed with set speed and then switches between appropriate states. Thus, task of the digital control is to deliver right amount of power to the motor by right numbers of state-1 and state-2 operations so that average power delivery matches required power. It needs few logic gates and comparators to implement digital control, thus making it extremely simple and easy to develop a low cost application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for speed control of BLDC motor drives.

The method uses the predictive algorithm and can be split into two parts. The purpose of the first part (PTC - predictive torque control) is to predict the reference flux vector corresponding to the reference torque. The aim of the second part is the optimal tracking of the reference flux by selecting either an active or a zero voltage vector. This method, called immediate flux control (IFC), has already been presented by the authors. There are two possible variants of IFC. The characteristic of the first variant is the selection between an active and zero voltage space vectors to be impressed throughout the entire sampling interval. The minimal flux error is obtained following a simple and fast algorithm. As a consequence, the switching frequency becomes very low, but current and torque ripple are considerable. The second IFC variant enables more accurate flux generation by applying an active vector throughout a calculated time interval within a sampling interval, thus requiring higher switching frequency. Both IFC variants together with PTC require minimal processing time. The method has been tested on a 3 kW induction machine laboratory model controlled by DSP. The experimental results confirm the validity of the approach","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Electric Machines and Drives, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10252/32672/01531397.pdf","startPage":"565","endPage":"571","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Electric Machines and Drives, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2005.195779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2005.195779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32672","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1531397","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictive Torque Control of Induction Machines using Immediate Flux Control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque control","Induction machines","Sampling methods","Induction generators","Voltage","Switching frequency","Prediction algorithms","Testing","Laboratories","Digital signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous machines","machine testing","machine vector control","magnetic flux","magnetic variables control","predictive control","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["immediate flux control","induction machines","predictive torque control","reference flux vector","reference torque","zero voltage vector","sampling interval","switching frequency","DSP","3 kW"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1531397/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-15 May 2005","displayDocTitle":"Predictive Torque Control of Induction Machines using Immediate Flux Control","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1531397/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9073018","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2005","conferenceDate":"15-15 May 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive Torque Control of Induction Machines using Immediate Flux Control","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01531397.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106186S","chronDate":"15-15 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10252","isNumber":"32672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10252","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"32672","articleId":"1531397","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1531400,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Using off-line models for estimating the motor parameters is known as a computationally intensive method, especially when the effect of cross saturation is included in the models. Therefore in practical applications, on-line parameter estimation is favored to achieve a high performance control system.

Three tasks are performed by the VSI: 1) turning-off of thyristors; 2) transfer of reactive load energy; 3) clamping peak voltages across the load and thyristors. The proposed CSI system with the small VSI can realize the commutation process of the inductive loads without large AC capacitors and complicated auxiliary circuits accompanying complex controls. Furthermore, the proposed CSI ensures simple and easy control of the commutation process due to the simple switching operation of the VSI. The VSI operates only during commutation periods of the load currents and stops working over the non-commutation periods. Thus, the VSI with small power rating can be used for the proposed CSI system. The feasibility of the proposed CSI system is verified by simulation and experimental results","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2005.195894","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2005.195894","startPage":"1327","endPage":"1334","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Electric Machines and Drives, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10252/32672/01531512.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Electric Machines and Drives, 2005.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A current source inverter with advanced circuit and control method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-15 May 2005","displayDocTitle":"A current source inverter with advanced circuit and control method","conferenceDate":"15-15 May 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2005","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1531512/","accessionNumber":"9054222","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1531512/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A current source inverter with advanced circuit and control method","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01531512.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048296S","chronDate":"15-15 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10252","isNumber":"32672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10252","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"32672","articleId":"1531512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1531517,"authors":[{"name":"Chunki Kwon","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Chunki Kwon (S'01) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Korea University in 1992 and 1994, respectively.

There are many modulation techniques available for a multilevel inverter but space vector PWM is commonly used. When the inverter operates in the sinusoidal mode of space vector PWM, the DC link voltage of the inverter is not fully utilized. A suitable overmodulation scheme is required to address this problem. Another problem associated with the space vector PWM of multilevel inverters is, when the level of the inverter increases, the implementation of space vector modulation becomes cumbersome due to the difficulty in determining the location of reference vector, calculation of on-times and large number of switching states. This paper proposes a simple space vector PWM algorithm, which (a) can cover sinusoidal mode and overmodulation mode (b) can easily determine the location of reference vector (c) can easily calculate the on-times (d) can be used for any level of inverter. In the proposed scheme, the on-time calculations are based on a standard two-level space vector PWM. The proposed scheme is explained for a 5-level cascaded H-bridge inverter with operation in sinusoidal mode, overmodulation mode I, and overmodulation mode II.

To achieve the stated objective, a new type of LSRM is proposed with twin stators and a translator between them with no back iron in the translator. The proposed configuration of the LSRM is designed, simulated and analyzed and compared to traditional LSRMs. The number of LSRM propulsion subsystems required is studied with a view to minimize their weights and an optimization study for that purpose is developed. Unique placement of the LSRM propulsion systems on the elevator is presented. Six sets of asymmetric bridge converters are chosen to drive the designed LSRM endowing it with high fault tolerance to the system. The propulsion force is generated using one phase or multi-phase excitation. In order to reduce force pulsations, a major requirement in elevators, controlled multi-phase excitation using one of the known force distribution functions (FDF) is an acceptable solution. The currently available FDFs are able to reduce the force pulsations but are not able to meet the peak force command is proven in this paper. Consequently, the speed and position control do not meet even the elementary performance requirements any more. A new FDF is proposed and presented to overcome the problem caused by the conventional FDF in this paper. The control system with the proposed FDF is derived and integrated for speed and position control. Extensive simulation results prove that the proposed LSRM with the new FDF exhibits superior performance and it is believed that it may be suitable for the ship elevator application","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Electric Machines and Drives, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10252/32672/01531549.pdf","startPage":"1584","endPage":"1591","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Electric Machines and Drives, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2005.195931","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2005.195931","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32672","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1531549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and control of a linear propulsion system for an elevator using linear switched reluctance motor drives","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Propulsion","Elevators","Reluctance motors","Marine vehicles","Position control","Stators","Iron","Analytical models","Bridges"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["angular velocity control","bridge circuits","design engineering","electric propulsion","fault tolerance","lifts","linear motors","position control","power convertors","reluctance motor drives","ships","stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear switched reluctance motor drives","linear propulsion system","ship elevator","twin stators","translator","asymmetric bridge converters","high fault tolerance","multiphase excitation","force pulsations reduction","force distribution functions","speed control","position control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1531549/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-15 May 2005","displayDocTitle":"Design and control of a linear propulsion system for an elevator using linear switched reluctance motor drives","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1531549/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9054249","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2005","conferenceDate":"15-15 May 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and control of a linear propulsion system for an elevator using linear switched reluctance motor drives","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01531549.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062519S","chronDate":"15-15 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10252","isNumber":"32672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10252","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"32672","articleId":"1531549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1531571,"authors":[{"name":"X.Y.

Three level or neutral point clamped converters (NPC) are typically operated at medium voltage using either integrated gate commutated thyristor (IGCT) or high voltage insulated gate bipolar transistor (HV-IGBT) devices. These high di/dt turn-off devices coupled with inherent parasitic inductances in the NPC pole structure produce large diode recovery transients for certain commutation sequences that compromise the device voltage margin. The NPC-RDCL achieves zero voltage switching of the all devices and minimizes recovery transients via low di/dt turn-off of pole diodes that significantly reduces commutation voltage overshoots and increases device utilization.

Stability criterions have been developed in terms of source and load impedance for both DC and AC systems and it is often helpful to have techniques for impedance measurement.

However, position-varying load torque oscillation at multiples of the rotational speed has exactly the same effect. Harmonics resulting from the load torque oscillation often obscure or even overwhelm the detection of rotor faults since the magnitudes of a load torque oscillation induced harmonics are usually much larger. This paper develops a simplified method to detect rotor faults effectively in the presence of a load torque oscillation. The interaction between the negative sequence harmonics produced by rotor faults and the positive sequence harmonics generated by a load torque oscillation creates a rotor fault indicator in a new characteristic fault frequency reference frame. A significant advantage of the proposed scheme is that it does not need any information about motor parameters or knowledge of the flux-oriented synchronous reference frame. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme. The sensitivity of the rotor fault indicator on the relative position between the rotor faults and a load torque oscillation is also investigated through repeated simulation trials","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2005.195978","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Electric Machines and Drives, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Electric Machines and Drives, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10252/32672/01531596.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2005.195978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32672","startPage":"1889","endPage":"1894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Separating load torque oscillation and rotor fault effects in stator current-based motor condition monitoring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1531596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Separating load torque oscillation and rotor fault effects in stator current-based motor condition monitoring","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-15 May 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1531596/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-15 May 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9045803","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1531596/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Separating load torque oscillation and rotor fault effects in stator current-based motor condition monitoring","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01531596.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045588S","chronDate":"15-15 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10252","isNumber":"32672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10252","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"32672","articleId":"1531596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1531597,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Diamantaras and S.Y. Kung, 1994] is analyzed. Hebbian neural networks are employed in communications and signal processing applications, among others, due to their capability to implement principal component analysis (PCA). Different improvements over the original model due to Oja have been developed in the last two decades. Among them, Sanger [T.D. Sanger, 1992], [J.A. Berzal and P.J. Zurifia, June 2005] and Rubner [K.I. Diamantaras and S.Y. Kung, 19941] models were designed to directly provide the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix. The behavior of these models has been traditionally considered on a continuous-time formulation whose validity is justified via some analytical procedures that presume, among other hypotheses, an specific asymptotic behavior of the learning gain. In practical applications, these assumptions cannot be guaranteed. This paper addresses the study of a deterministic discrete-time (DDT) formulation of the Rubner net, that characterizes the average evolution of the net, preserving the discrete-time form of the original network and gathering the influence of the learning gain [P.J. Zurifia, Nov 2002]. This way, the dynamical behavior of Rubner model is analyzed in this more realistic context. The results thoroughly characterize the relationship between the learning gain and the eigenvalue structure of the correlation matrix.","doi":"10.1109/WISP.2005.1531648","startPage":"143","endPage":"148","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Workshop on Intelligent Signal Processing, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10253/32674/01531648.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Workshop on Intelligent Signal Processing, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WISP.2005.1531648","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local analysis of a new Rubner-type neural network via a DDT formulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Discrete cosine transforms","Stochastic processes","Artificial neural networks","Principal component analysis","Stochastic systems","Signal processing","Context modeling","Neurons","Telecommunication standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","principal component analysis","Hebbian learning","discrete time systems","telecommunication networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Rubner-type neural network","DDT formulation","Hebbian neural networks","principal component analysis","deterministic discrete-time"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1531648/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Local analysis of a new Rubner-type neural network via a DDT formulation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1531648/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8835598","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local analysis of a new Rubner-type neural network via a DDT formulation","confLoc":"Faro, Portugal","sourcePdf":"01531648.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.137456S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10253","isNumber":"32674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10253","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"32674","articleId":"1531648","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1531649,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In such systems there are cases where due to abrupt changes within the environment and/or the processing system temporal shortage of computational power and/or loss of some data may occur. It is an obvious requirement that even in such situations the actual processing should be continued to insure appropriate performance. This means that signal processing of somewhat simpler complexity should provide outputs of acceptable quality to continue the operation of the complete embedded system. The accuracy of the processing will be temporarily lower but possibly still enough to produce data for qualitative evaluations and supporting decisions. In this paper a new anytime Fourier transformation algorithm is introduced. The presented method reduces the delay problem caused by the block-oriented fast algorithms and at the same time keeps the computational complexity on relatively low level. It also makes possible the availability of partial results or estimates in case of abrupt reaction need, long or possibly infinite input data sequences.","doi":"10.1109/WISP.2005.1531669","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Workshop on Intelligent Signal Processing, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Workshop on Intelligent Signal Processing, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10253/32674/01531669.pdf","startPage":"266","endPage":"271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WISP.2005.1531669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anytime Fourier transformation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1531669","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1531669/","displayDocTitle":"Anytime Fourier transformation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8835613","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1531669/","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anytime Fourier transformation","confLoc":"Faro, Portugal","sourcePdf":"01531669.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04304S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10253","isNumber":"32674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10253","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"32674","articleId":"1531669","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1531680,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Wu","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Information Technology, University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Jyvaskyla, Finland"],"lastName":"Rui Wu","id":"37279513400"},{"name":"T.

The substantial time required for averaging in software was eliminated in the developed architecture by using hardware averaging at the speed of waveform occurrence, due to a fully pipelined operation of constituent units. This architecture was implemented using an FPGA development board, and was tested at a number of averages above 10,000 that should theoretically provide a reduction of the additive noise by more than 100 times. The effect of the noise reduction was clear from experiment. However, lower than predicted improvements were achieved when the level of the input noise before averaging was low. This occurred due to the quantization of the input signal, and should not be attributed to the averaging. Therefore, averaging of digitized data can impose particular limits on the achievable noise reduction but this only occurs when the noise level is very low and does not require much reduction per se.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1531681/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8835620","htmlLink":"/document/1531681/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"VLSI architecture for repetitive waveform measurement with zero overhead averaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI architecture for repetitive waveform measurement with zero overhead averaging","confLoc":"Faro, Portugal","sourcePdf":"01531681.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048082S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10253","isNumber":"32674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10253","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"32674","articleId":"1531681","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1531683,"authors":[{"name":"Hd.O.

The algorithms are optimized to be used in uniprocessor systems, presenting as one of their main features the ability to compute over the borders of the data segments without relying on any techniques that are traditionally used for thus task, like zero padding. A modified version of the recursive pyramid algorithm was used to compute the direct transform, keeping just the features to minimize data storage but eliminating its dependency on extension techniques. The inverse transform is computed by an algorithm inspired in the RPA, the quadrature mirror filter bank and the overlap-save method for filter convolutions. To evaluate the performance the algorithms were implemented on a DSP coupled to a digitizer through its external memory bus, what allowed deterministic behavior. After a stage of optimization an analysis of data storage and computation load were made. These results and the potential applications are discussed at the end of the paper.","doi":"10.1109/WISP.2005.1531683","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Workshop on Intelligent Signal Processing, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Workshop on Intelligent Signal Processing, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10253/32674/01531683.pdf","startPage":"346","endPage":"351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WISP.2005.1531683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time wavelet transform algorithms for the processing of continuous streams of data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1531683","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1531683/","displayDocTitle":"Real-time wavelet transform algorithms for the processing of continuous streams of data","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8835622","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1531683/","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time wavelet transform algorithms for the processing of continuous streams of data","confLoc":"Faro, Portugal","sourcePdf":"01531683.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050955S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10253","isNumber":"32674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10253","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"32674","articleId":"1531683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1531698,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The amplifier employs a two-stage topology to achieve low noise figure and high linearity across 8-12 GHz. At 10 GHz the LNA yielded a gain of 24.2 dB, a noise figure of 1.68 dB, and a third-order intercept point of 17.5 dBm. The power dissipation of the circuit is 33.6 mW using a 1.8 V supply voltage.

The measured overall power-added efficiency (PAE) reached 50.7%, with a normalized power RMS error of 0.7% and ACLR of -52dBc at an offset frequency of 5MHz, at an average output power of 37.2W and gain of 10.0dB for a single carrier WCDMA signal. To the authors' knowledge, this corresponds to the best efficiency reported for a single stage base station power amplifier. Digital predistortion (DPD) was used at two levels: memoryless DPD to compensate for the expected gain variation of the amplifier over the bias envelope trajectory, and deterministic memory mitigation, to further improve the linearity. The signal envelope had a peak-to-average power ratio of 7.67dB.","doi":"10.1109/CSICS.2005.1531768","publicationTitle":"IEEE Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuit Symposium, 2005.

These techniques are used in the context of concatenated codes, with Turbo codes as the main example, but are almost never applied to existing classical codes. In this paper, the family of Reed-Solomon codes is considered and the complexity problem of Soft-In Soft-Out RS decoding is tackled by breaking RS codes into several smaller subcodes. The decomposition, presented here, is based on filterbanks with one subcode in each subband. The critical subsampling is then crucial if the filterbank is going to be used in a soft decoding setup. This paper focuses on the construction of such filterbanks, starting from non-critically subsampled filterbanks and evolving to a critically subsampled filterbank.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2005.1531873","publicationTitle":"IEEE Information Theory Workshop, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Information Theory Workshop, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10256/32676/01531873.pdf","startPage":"6 pp.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2005.1531873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft-in soft-out Reed-Solomon decoding using critically subsampled filterbanks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1531873","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1531873/","displayDocTitle":"Soft-in soft-out Reed-Solomon decoding using critically subsampled filterbanks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8884889","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1531873/","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft-in soft-out Reed-Solomon decoding using critically subsampled filterbanks","confLoc":"Rotorua, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"01531873.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098712S","chronDate":"29 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10256","isNumber":"32676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10256","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"32676","articleId":"1531873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1531874,"authors":[{"name":"R.R.

We model wideband transmission by considering M parallel subchannels, each of which is affected by fading. The fading processes in each subchannel are slowly time-varying with respect to the coding block length. Hence, in order to maintain given rate requirements for each user and each channel state, power control is used. We study the delay-limited achievable sum rate (throughput) versus the system E/sub b//N/sub O/, under orthogonal and optimal signaling. We show that for both the orthogonal and the optimal schemes, in the limit of large K and finite M, the optimal allocation strategy consists of allocating each user to its best subchannel only. Hence, we are able to quantify the multiuser diversity gain by comparing the case K /spl rarr/ /spl infin/ with the single-user delay-limited case. Finally, we show that the limits of optimal signaling can be approached by relatively simple convolutional codes and iterative joint multiuser decoding with appropriate power control. The proposed scheme can be regarded as a practical version of the optimal successive decoding approach, that mitigates the error propagation due to the suboptimality of the user channel codes.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2005.1531874","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2005.1531874","startPage":"5 pp.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Information Theory Workshop, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10256/32676/01531874.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Information Theory Workshop, 2005.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser diversity in delay-limited cellular wideband systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser diversity in delay-limited cellular wideband systems","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1531874/","accessionNumber":"8884890","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1531874/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser diversity in delay-limited cellular wideband systems","confLoc":"Rotorua, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"01531874.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078132S","chronDate":"29 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10256","isNumber":"32676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10256","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"32676","articleId":"1531874","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1531880,"authors":[{"name":"H.D.

We focus on a sequence of bit-regular ensembles with degree 3 which was shown to achieve capacity with bounded complexity [Pfister, 2005]. To characterize how fast the block length of the code must grow with respect to the truncation point of the degree distribution (i.e., maximum check degree), we compute an upper bound on the average weight enumerator. Based on this analysis, we present a particular truncation sequence that could achieve a minimum distance which grows like n/sup 1/3/ even as the gap to capacity goes to zero. We also consider the performance of these codes in the waterfall region by extending the finite-length scaling law [Amraoui] from low-density parity-check codes to IRA codes. This shows that the performance near the iterative decoding threshold is well characterized by a suitably scaled Q-function for large enough block length. Numerical results are given for the scaling parameters of this ensemble sequence and for a few other IRA codes. Unfortunately, the simulation results for the capacity-achieving sequence start to match the scaling law only for very large block lengths.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2005.1531880","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2005.1531880","startPage":"5 pp.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Information Theory Workshop, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10256/32676/01531880.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Information Theory Workshop, 2005.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-length analysis of a capacity-achieving ensemble for the binary erasure channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Finite-length analysis of a capacity-achieving ensemble for the binary erasure channel","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1531880/","accessionNumber":"8884895","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1531880/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-length analysis of a capacity-achieving ensemble for the binary erasure channel","confLoc":"Rotorua, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"01531880.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069943S","chronDate":"29 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10256","isNumber":"32676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10256","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"32676","articleId":"1531880","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1531886,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The method combines constraint programming techniques with a high performance force directed placement (FDP) algorithm so that the directed nature of the graph is highlighted while useful properties of FDP - such as emphasis of symmetries and preservation of proximity relations - are retained. Our algorithm automatically identifies those parts of the digraph that contain hierarchical information and draws them accordingly. Additionally, those parts that do not contain hierarchy are drawn at the same quality expected from a nonhierarchical, undirected layout algorithm. An interesting application of our algorithm is directional multidimensional scaling (DMDS). DMDS deals with low dimensional embedding of multivariate data where we want to emphasize the overall flow in the data (e.g. chronological progress) along one of the axes.","doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.2005.1532130","publicationTitle":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization, 2005.

We present a set of ten low level analysis tasks that largely capture people's activities while employing information visualization tools for understanding data. To help develop these tasks, we collected nearly 200 sample questions from students about how they would analyze five particular data sets from different domains. The questions, while not being totally comprehensive, illustrated the sheer variety of analytic questions typically posed by users when employing information visualization systems. We hope that the presented set of tasks is useful for information visualization system designers as a kind of common substrate to discuss the relative analytic capabilities of the systems. Further, the tasks may provide a form of checklist for system designers.","doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.2005.1532136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.2005.1532136","startPage":"111","endPage":"117","publicationTitle":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization, 2005.

Cognitive walkthrough (CW) is a well known usability inspection method that focuses on how easily users can learn software through exploration. Typical applications of CW follow structured tasks where user goals and action sequences that lead to achievement of the goals are well defined. KDViz and other information visualization tools, however, are typically designed for users to explore data and user goals and actions are less well understood. In this paper, we describe how the traditional CW method may be adapted for assessing the usability of these systems. We apply the adapted version of CW to CiteSpace, a KDViz tool that uses bibliometric analyses to create visualizations of scientific literatures. We describe usability issues identified by the adapted CW and discuss how CiteSpace supported the completion of tasks, such as identifying research fronts, and the achievement of goals. Finally, we discuss improvements to the adapted CW and issues to be addressed before applying it to a wider range of KDViz tools.","doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.2005.1532147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.2005.1532147","publicationTitle":"IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization, 2005.

We present a method for generating flow maps using hierarchical clustering given a set of nodes, positions, and flow data between the nodes.

This paper addresses the collaborative control issues of distributed device networks under open and dynamic environments. The security challenges of authenticity, integrity, confidentiality, and execution safety are considered as primary design constraints. By adopting policy-based network security technologies and XML processing technologies, two new modules of Secure Device Control Gateway and Security Agent are introduced into regular distributed device control networks to provide security and safety enhancing mechanisms. The core architectures, applied mechanisms, and implementation considerations are presented in detail in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2005.843826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2005.843826","startPage":"217","endPage":"225","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/32682/01532156.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32682","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed device networks with security constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Distributed device networks with security constraints","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","volume":"1","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1532156/","accessionNumber":"8657669","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532156/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed device networks with security constraints","sourcePdf":"01532156.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04822S","chronDate":"Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"32682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"32682","articleId":"1532156","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1532177,"authors":[{"name":"S.

However, the introduction of multiple taps results in the addition of uncorrelated noise to the ABA. This results in power loss in the direction perpendicular to the ABA. In order to compensate for the loss introduced by the addition of taps, the proposed concept is investigated.

In contrast to existing schemes that require nonlinear iterative searches over the multidimensional parameter space, this paper proposes a blind estimator that provides an algebraic solution to the joint parameter estimation problem. By exploiting the subspace structure of the observed signal, the multiuser estimation is first decoupled into a series of single-user estimation problems, and then analytical tools of polynomial matrices are invoked for joint carrier and code timing estimation of a single user. The proposed estimator is near-far resistant. It can deal with frequency-selective and time-varying channels. The performance of the proposed scheme is examined analytically by a first-order perturbation analysis. The authors also derive an unconditional Crame/spl acute/r-Rao bound (CRB) that is conditioned neither on fading coefficients nor information symbols; as such, the CRB is considered a suitable lower bound for blind methods. Numerical examples are presented to evaluate and compare the proposed and a multidimensional search (MD-search)-based scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint estimation of carrier offset and code timing for DS-CDMA with performance analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2005.853819","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/32683/01532179.pdf","startPage":"1980","endPage":"1987","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2005.853819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32683","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532179","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532179/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Joint estimation of carrier offset and code timing for DS-CDMA with performance analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1532179/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8646955","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint estimation of carrier offset and code timing for DS-CDMA with performance analysis","sourcePdf":"01532179.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058674S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"32683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"32683","articleId":"1532179","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1532180,"authors":[{"name":"Jianhua Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Embrey-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona Beach, FL, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Jianhua Liu","id":"37279464300"},{"name":"Jian Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Jian Li","id":"37279843500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"1532180","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":288},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"abstract":"We consider improving the overall system performance of an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing-based multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless local area network system.

In this paper, a new method that uses moments up to the fourth order is proposed for computing the BEP. The method is derived from a five-point Chebyshev interpolation formula and is inherently more accurate than the SIGA. Like the SIGA, the new method requires the evaluation of only closed-form expressions and the error function.

Pairwise error probability (PEP) analysis suggests how SLM and PTS vectors should be chosen. The decoder performs well over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, fading channels, and amplifier nonlinearities.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SLM and PTS peak-power reduction of OFDM signals without side information","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2005.853916","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/32683/01532183.pdf","startPage":"2006","endPage":"2013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2005.853916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32683","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532183","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532183/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"SLM and PTS peak-power reduction of OFDM signals without side information","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1532183/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8646959","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SLM and PTS peak-power reduction of OFDM signals without side information","sourcePdf":"01532183.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061445S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"32683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"173","xplore-issue":"32683","articleId":"1532183","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1532184,"authors":[{"name":"Huaping Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"lastName":"Huaping Liu","id":"37310126400"},{"name":"Yongzhong Song","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Computer Science, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Yongzhong Song","id":"37560038700"},{"name":"R.C.

This model contains a matched filter, and, thus, requires prior knowledge of the continuous-time channel-impulse response. Therefore, if the channel is continuous and unknown, it is unrealistic to use the DTTF model, which leads to an upper bound on the system performance. Using an alternative model for the equivalent discrete-time channel, where the matched filter is replaced by a receive filter matched to the symbol waveform, we propose a framework to quantitatively investigate the performance loss from a theoretical perspective.

Several space-time signaling schemes have been proposed to make use of this increased capacity. Space-time techniques, such as space-time block coding and spatial multiplexing, can all be viewed as signaling with a multidimensional constellation. Because of the large capacity of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, these multidimensional constellations often have large cardinalities. For this reason, it is impractical to perform optimal maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding for space-time systems, even for a moderate number of transmit antennas. In this paper, we propose a modified version of the classic Chase decoder for multiple-antenna systems. The decoder applies successive detection to yield an initial estimate of the transmitted bit sequence, constructs a list of candidate symbol vectors using this initial estimate, and then computes bit likelihood information over this list. Three algorithms are presented for constructing the candidate vector list. This decoder can be adjusted to have a fixed or variable complexity, while maintaining performance close to that of an ML decoder.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/32683/01532187.pdf","startPage":"2035","endPage":"2039","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2005.853830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2005.853830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32683","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-time Chase decoding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood decoding","MIMO","Signal processing algorithms","Maximum likelihood detection","Maximum likelihood estimation","Transmitting antennas","Multidimensional systems","Constellation diagram","Yield estimation","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time codes","block codes","antenna arrays","radiocommunication","MIMO systems","maximum likelihood decoding","computational complexity","multidimensional signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time block coding","multiple-antenna wireless systems","space-time Chase decoding","spatial multiplexing","multiple-input multiple-output channels","MIMO","multidimensional constellations","optimal maximum-likelihood decoding","transmit antennas","transmitted bit sequence estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chase decoding","maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems","spatial multiplexing","sphere decoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532187/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","displayDocTitle":"Space-time Chase decoding","volume":"4","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1532187/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8646963","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-time Chase decoding","sourcePdf":"01532187.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071984S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"32683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"32683","articleId":"1532187","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1532188,"authors":[{"name":"L.A.

Specifically, a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (EA) is used to generate complex spreading sequences that are optimized with respect to the average mean-square cross- and/or autocorrelation (CC and/or AC) properties. A theoretical model is developed in order to demonstrate the optimality of the generated codes. The proposed algorithm enables spreading code design with no constraints on the code length. Furthermore, it is possible to generate K/spl ges/N codes of length N with very little cost in correlation properties. This results in significant capacity enhancement in DS-CDMA systems.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2005.853826","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/32683/01532190.pdf","startPage":"2051","endPage":"2056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2005.853826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An evolutionary approach to designing complex spreading codes for DS-CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532190","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532190/","displayDocTitle":"An evolutionary approach to designing complex spreading codes for DS-CDMA","volume":"4","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8646966","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1532190/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An evolutionary approach to designing complex spreading codes for DS-CDMA","sourcePdf":"01532190.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074549S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"32683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"32683","articleId":"1532190","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1532191,"authors":[{"name":"Wan Choi","affiliation":["Wireless Networking and Communications Group (WNCG), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Technology, Austin, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Wan Choi","id":"37281364300"},{"name":"J.G.

The prefiltering coefficients are designed so as to minimize a proper cost function that depends on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) at the mobile terminals (MTs).

FDCP tries to minimize the effect of the assigned channels on the channel availability to the interfering cells and to reduce the overall reuse distances of the systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532197/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1532197/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8657009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"4","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic channel partitioning with flexible channel combination for TDMA-based cellular systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic channel partitioning with flexible channel combination for TDMA-based cellular systems","sourcePdf":"01532197.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063937S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"32683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"32683","articleId":"1532197","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1532198,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Sheng Hou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Wen-Sheng Hou received the B.S. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Tatung Institute of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1991, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing-Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1993 and 2000, respectively.","His research topics are in the area of statistical signal processing, wireless communications, and wireless networks with application in the wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), and code division multiple access (CDMA) systems."]},"lastName":"Wen-Sheng Hou","id":"37087183351"},{"name":"Bor-Sen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Bor-Sen Chen (M'82\u2013SM'89\u2013F'01) received the B.S. degree from the Tatung Institute of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., the M.S. degree from the National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan, R.O.C., and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, in 1970, 1973, and 1982. respectively. all in electrical engineering.","He was a Lecturer, Associate Professor, and Professor at the Tatung Institute of Technology from 1973 to 1987.

In this study, an efficient ICI suppression with less noise enhancement for multicarrier equalization is presented by using a parallel canceling scheme via frequency-domain equalization techniques, with the assumption that the channel impulse response (CIR) varies linearly during a block period. In order to avoid performance deterioration due to unreliable initial estimations in the parallel cancellation scheme, a cost function with proper weighting factor is introduced to improve the performance of the proposed equalizer. The proposed equalizer consists of a set of prefilters and a set of ICI cancellation filters, with two stages to perform different functions to achieve minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalization. The prefilters compensate for the multiplicative distortion at the first stage, and the ICI cancellation filters remove the effects of ICI by a parallel cancellation scheme at the second stage. Finally, the performance of the proposed equalizer is analyzed and compared with that of other equalizers, indicating significant performance improvement.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2005.853837","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/32683/01532198.pdf","startPage":"2100","endPage":"2110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2005.853837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ICI cancellation for OFDM communication systems in time-varying multipath fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532198","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532198/","displayDocTitle":"ICI cancellation for OFDM communication systems in time-varying multipath fading channels","volume":"4","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8646971","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1532198/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ICI cancellation for OFDM communication systems in time-varying multipath fading channels","sourcePdf":"01532198.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072583S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"32683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"32683","articleId":"1532198","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1532200,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

In this paper, we first present a method to estimate reverse-link multicell coverage using a duration-outage approach. Using this, we then proceed to quantitatively analyze reverse-link coverage expansion from soft handoff as a function of the carried traffic in the cell under different propagation environments. Our results show that for modest values of carried traffic, the coverage expansion is almost constant. However, when the amount of carried traffic is large, the coverage expansion can increase dramatically. Next, we examine the dependence of the soft-handoff coverage expansion on key characteristics of the large-scale shadowing environment. Results are presented that quantify the coverage-expansion dependence on the large-scale shadowing's correlation distance (d/sub c/), variability (/spl sigma//sub Z/), path-loss exponent (K/sub 2/), and the correlation between the two-cell large-scale shadowing environments (C/sub Z/). The results indicate that realistic variations in these propagation conditions have a significant, and sometimes dramatic, effect on the coverage expansion provided by soft handoff. Finally, we analyze the capacity improvement from soft handoff and the tradeoff between capacity improvement versus coverage expansion. Understanding and managing the capacity improvement versus coverage expansion tradeoff is critical for achieving optimal CDMA cell-network performance.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2005.853880","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/32683/01532203.pdf","startPage":"2163","endPage":"2171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2005.853880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coverage expansion and capacity improvement from soft handoff for CDMA cellular systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532203","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532203/","displayDocTitle":"Coverage expansion and capacity improvement from soft handoff for CDMA cellular systems","volume":"4","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8646976","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1532203/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coverage expansion and capacity improvement from soft handoff for CDMA cellular systems","sourcePdf":"01532203.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068434S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"32683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"32683","articleId":"1532203","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1532206,"authors":[{"name":"M.C.

First, the structure of the capacity-achieving input signals is investigated when the input is constrained to have limited peakedness by imposing either a fourth moment or a peak constraint. When the input is subject to second and fourth moment limitations, it is shown that the capacity-achieving input amplitude distribution is discrete with a finite number of mass points in the low-power regime. A similar discrete structure for the optimal amplitude is proven over the entire signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range when there is only a peak-power constraint. The Rician fading with the phase-noise channel model, where there is phase uncertainty in the specular component, is analyzed. For this model, it is shown that, with only an average power constraint, the capacity-achieving input amplitude is discrete with a finite number of levels. For the classical average-power-limited Rician fading channel, it is proven that the optimal input amplitude distribution has bounded support.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2005.853970","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/32683/01532206.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2005.853970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32683","startPage":"2193","endPage":"2206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The noncoherent rician fading Channel-part I: structure of the capacity-achieving input","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532206","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The noncoherent rician fading Channel-part I: structure of the capacity-achieving input","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532206/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"4","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8646979","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1532206/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The noncoherent rician fading Channel-part I: structure of the capacity-achieving input","sourcePdf":"01532206.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103404S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"32683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"32683","articleId":"1532206","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1532207,"authors":[{"name":"M.C.

We analyze the performance of group DSTF coding over correlated fading channels and establish the design criteria for subcarrier selection and code selection. In addition to applying existing differential unitary diagonal codes, we propose a systematic approach to designing nondiagonal codes for DSTF systems, which are block diagonal (BD) and have the necessary unitary and full diversity properties.

Long channel dispersion causing both impediments to be severe makes the direct application of trellis-based turbo equalizers impossible, particularly for high-order signal modulations. For this reason, we present two computationally feasible space-time turbo receiver architectures employing linear antenna arrays and broadband beamformers. The first receiver uses a beamformer for joint rejection of interfering signals and shortening of the channel corresponding to the desired signal so that a scalar trellis-based turbo equalizer can be applied to its output. At each beamformer branch, the composite effect of the CCI and the white channel noise is viewed as colored noise. Because trellis search algorithms are limited to cases where the observation noise is white, this imposes quadratic noise whitening constraints on the beamformer design that is solved by a Lagrangian relaxation approach. The second receiver architecture removes the dependence on trellis search techniques for equalization by implementing the turbo equalizer directly with a soft-information-aided broadband beamformer at its front end and a soft-input soft-output (SISO) decoder at its back end. We outline the design considerations associated with each receiver and present bit error rate (BER) simulations for the turbo equalization of 8-phase-shift keying (PSK) TCM signals.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532210/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"4","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1532210/","accessionNumber":"8657011","displayDocTitle":"Broadband beamforming for joint interference cancellation and turbo equalization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadband beamforming for joint interference cancellation and turbo equalization","sourcePdf":"01532210.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057184S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"32683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"32683","articleId":"1532210","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1532211,"authors":[{"name":"D.

OFDM is used to transform a frequency-selective fading channel into multiple flat fading channels, and space-frequency trellis coding combined with bit-interleaving is used to exploit space and frequency diversity. The performance of such an approach is evaluated by analytical bounds and simulation. The proposed scheme is an efficient method to employ multiple transmit antennas to increase the data rate and, at the same time, improve the performance by means of increased diversity obtained with bit-interleaved coded modulation and multiple receive antennas. A block precoding method is proposed to further improve the diversity order. An efficient sphere decoding algorithm is also developed for reducing the decoding complexity of the proposed scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/32683/01532211.pdf","startPage":"2256","endPage":"2266","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2005.853816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2005.853816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32683","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit-interleaved space-frequency coded Modulation for OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation coding","OFDM modulation","Receiving antennas","Frequency-selective fading channels","Decoding","Frequency division multiplexing","Frequency modulation","Frequency diversity","Performance analysis","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["precoding","interleaved codes","frequency modulation","OFDM modulation","fading channels","channel coding","transmitting antennas","receiving antennas","antenna arrays","trellis codes","block codes","diversity reception","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bit-interleaved space-frequency coded modulation","OFDM system","frequency-selective fading channel","antenna array","transmit antenna","receive antenna","space-frequency trellis coding","sphere decoding algorithm","constellation precoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM)","constellation precoding","frequency diversity","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","space\u2013time coding","sphere decoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532211/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","displayDocTitle":"Bit-interleaved space-frequency coded Modulation for OFDM systems","volume":"4","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1532211/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8657012","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit-interleaved space-frequency coded Modulation for OFDM systems","sourcePdf":"01532211.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07315S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"32683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"32683","articleId":"1532211","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1532212,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The effective SNR is a function of both /spl gamma/~ and /spl rho/, the magnitude of the normalized cross correlation between the actual and the estimated channel gains.

It also supports system switching between PHS and WLAN and over-the-air (OTA) software downloading. In this paper, we design an IEEE 802.11 WLAN around the SDR; we show the software architecture of the SDR prototype and describe how it handles the IEEE 802.11 WLAN protocol. The medium access control (MAC) sublayer functions are executed on the CPU, while the physical layer (PHY) functions such as modulation/demodulation are processed by the DSPs; higher speed digital signal processes are run on the PPP implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The most difficult problem in implementing the WLAN in this way is meeting the short interframe space (SIFS) requirement of the IEEE 802.11 standard; we elucidate the potential weakness of the current configuration and specify a way of implementing the IEEE 802.11 protocol that avoids this problem. This paper also describes an experimental evaluation of the prototype for WLAN use, the results of which agree well with computer-simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2005.853967","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/32683/01532215.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32683","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2005.853967","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"2299","endPage":"2308","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN implemented on software defined radio with hybrid programmable architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","displayDocTitle":"IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN implemented on software defined radio with hybrid programmable architecture","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532215/","volume":"4","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1532215/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8657016","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN implemented on software defined radio with hybrid programmable architecture","sourcePdf":"01532215.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062635S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"32683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"32683","articleId":"1532215","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1532218,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this paper, we propose an IC architecture that makes use of a block decision feedback equalizer (DFE) to remove intersymbol interference (ISI) and whose overall complexity is much lower than equivalent (in terms of performance) existing structures. In fact, by making use of a particular block data transmission format, all filters are implemented in the frequency domain (FD), and in particular, the DFE is iteratively designed according to the reliability of the detected data in the previous iteration. Due to the strong interaction of the FD-IC and the block DFE, error propagation in the receiver is reduced by simply interleaving (INT) chips before transmission. Simulations performed for an uplink communication on a wireless multipath channel show that the combination of FD-IC, block DFE, and chip INT provides an efficient solution with good performance for CDMA systems in dispersive channels.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2005.853823","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/32683/01532218.pdf","startPage":"2329","endPage":"2339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2005.853823","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-domain interference cancellation and nonlinear equalization for CDMA systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-domain interference cancellation and nonlinear equalization for CDMA systems","volume":"4","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","accessionNumber":"8657019","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1532218/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532218/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-domain interference cancellation and nonlinear equalization for CDMA systems","sourcePdf":"01532218.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073582S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"32683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"32683","articleId":"1532218","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1532220,"authors":[{"name":"Shuguang Cui","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/32683/1532220/1532220-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shuguang Cui (S'99\u2013M'05) received the B.Eng. degree in radio engineering with the highest distinction from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 1997, the M.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada, in 2000, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2005.","From 1997 to 1998, he worked at Hewlett-Packard, Beijing, China, as a System Engineer.

A novel framework for dynamic joint adaptation of modulation order, number of code channels (hence transmission rate), and transmission power is proposed for downlink data transmission in a cellular WCDMA system where different users have similar frame error rate (FER) requirements. Based on a general downlink signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) model, the problem of optimal dynamic rate and power adaptation is formulated, for which the rate and power allocation can be found by an exhaustive search. Two heuristic-based dynamic rate and power allocation schemes are proposed. Performance of dynamic joint rate and power adaptation under the proposed framework is evaluated for a random micromobility model using computer simulations. Also, an analytical approach to evaluate the throughput performance of dynamic rate and power adaptation using high-order modulation and multicode formats is presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic rate and power adaptation for forward link transmission using high-order modulation and multicode formats in cellular WCDMA networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2005.853814","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/32683/01532221.pdf","startPage":"2361","endPage":"2372","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2005.853814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32683","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532221","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532221/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic rate and power adaptation for forward link transmission using high-order modulation and multicode formats in cellular WCDMA networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1532221/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8657022","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic rate and power adaptation for forward link transmission using high-order modulation and multicode formats in cellular WCDMA networks","sourcePdf":"01532221.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072249S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"32683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"32683","articleId":"1532221","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1532223,"authors":[{"name":"G.

A systematic framework for achieving such a gain consists in making the cooperating nodes act as the antennas of a virtual transmit array, operating according to a distributed space-time coding (DSTC) strategy. However, cooperation implies the allocation of dedicated resources, typically power and time slots, for the exchange of data between source and intermediate nodes (relays). It is then necessary to design the system properly to make possible a final net gain, taking into account all resources involved in the communication. In this paper, we consider regenerative relays and we analyze the effect of intermediate decision errors at the relay nodes. We derive the optimal maximum-likelihood (ML) detector, at the final destination, in case of binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) transmission, and a suboptimal scalar detector, whose bit-error rate (BER) is expressed in (approximate) closed form. Since with DSTC the transmit antennas are not colocated, we show how to allocate the power among source and relay terminals in order to minimize the average BER at the final destination. Finally, we compare alternative cooperation and decoding strategies.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/32683/01532223.pdf","startPage":"2387","endPage":"2399","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2005.853883","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2005.853883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32683","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed space-time coding for regenerative relay networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Power system relaying","Bit error rate","Transmitting antennas","Phase detection","Detectors","Wireless networks","Quality of service","Antenna arrays","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time codes","relays","mobile radio","maximum likelihood decoding","maximum likelihood detection","phase shift keying","error statistics","telecommunication terminals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed space-time coding strategy","regenerative relay network","mobile user","wireless network","QoS","quality of service","virtual transmit antenna array","intermediate node","maximum likelihood detector","binary phase shift keying","BER","bit error rate","cooperative communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative communications","distributed space\u2013time coding (DSTC)","relay networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532223/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","displayDocTitle":"Distributed space-time coding for regenerative relay networks","volume":"4","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1532223/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8657024","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed space-time coding for regenerative relay networks","sourcePdf":"01532223.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081306S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"32683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"32683","articleId":"1532223","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1532224,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Existing SM schemes (e.g., V-BLAST) rely on the linear independence of transmit antenna channel responses for stream separation and suffer considerably from high levels of fading correlation. As a result, such algorithms simply fail to extract the nonzero capacity that is present even in highly correlated spatial channels. The authors make the simple but key point that only one transmit antenna is needed to send several independent streams if those streams are appropriately superposed to form a high-order modulation (e.g., two 4-quadratic amplitude modulation (4-QAM) signals form a 16-QAM). The concept builds upon constellation multiplexing (CM) (D. Gesbert and J. Akhtar, Smart Antennas in Europe-State-of-the-Art, 2005) whereby distinct QAM streams are superposed to form a higher order constellation with rate equivalent to the sum of rates of all original streams. In contrast to SM transmission, the substreams in CM schemes are differentiated through power scaling rather than through spatial signatures. The authors build on this idea to present a new transmission scheme based on a precoder, adjusting the phase and power of the input constellations in closed form as a function of the antenna correlation. This yields a rate-preserving MIMO multiplexing scheme that can operate smoothly at any degree of correlation. At the extreme correlation case (identical channels), the scheme behaves equivalent to sending a single higher order modulation whose independent components are mapped to the different antennas.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial multiplexing over correlated MIMO channels with a closed-form precoder","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2005.853915","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/32683/01532224.pdf","startPage":"2400","endPage":"2409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2005.853915","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32683","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532224","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532224/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2005","displayDocTitle":"Spatial multiplexing over correlated MIMO channels with a closed-form precoder","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1532224/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8657025","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial multiplexing over correlated MIMO channels with a closed-form precoder","sourcePdf":"01532224.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08435S","chronDate":"Sept.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"32683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"32683","articleId":"1532224","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1532225,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/32683/1532225/1532225-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dong Wang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 1996 and 1999, respectively, both in electrical engineering.

It converts an intersymbol interference (ISI) channel into multiple \"ISI-free\" vector channels while involving channel matrices instead of channel coefficients in one-tap equalization. Over multipath fading channels, it benefits from signal-space diversity. This paper addresses practical issues such as guard-band configuration, timing estimation, and carrier- and sampling-frequency synchronization for vector OFDM. An equivalent structure derived for vector OFDM manifests the relation between vector OFDM and conventional OFDM so that the solutions to guard-band configuration as well as carrier- and sampling-frequency synchronization for conventional OFDM can be modified to fit into the vector-OFDM framework. It is also shown by analysis that the pre-fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms for timing estimation and carrier-frequency synchronization in the conventional OFDM framework can be extended straightforwardly to vector OFDM with comparable performance. Simulation results of uncoded systems are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed synchronization techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/32683/01532229.pdf","startPage":"2454","endPage":"2464","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2005.853910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2005.853910","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32683","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization techniques and guard-band-configuration scheme for single-antenna vector-OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Frequency synchronization","Intersymbol interference","Digital video broadcasting","Timing","Wireless LAN","Matrix converters","Fading","Performance analysis","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronisation","antennas","OFDM modulation","intersymbol interference","wireless channels","equalisers","multipath channels","fading channels","diversity reception","fast Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["guard-band-configuration scheme","single-antenna vector-OFDM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","intersymbol interference","one-tap equalization","multipath fading channel","signal-space diversity","timing estimation","carrier-frequency synchronization technique","sampling-frequency synchronization technique","prefast Fourier transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carrier-frequency synchronization","guard-band configuration","sampling-frequency synchronization","signal-space diversity","timing estimation","vector OFDM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532229/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization techniques and guard-band-configuration scheme for single-antenna vector-OFDM systems","volume":"4","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1532229/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8657030","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization techniques and guard-band-configuration scheme for single-antenna vector-OFDM systems","sourcePdf":"01532229.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.33406S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"32683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"32683","articleId":"1532229","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1532230,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The methodology for maintaining phase continuity with a cyclic guard interval is presented. Various optimal and suboptimal reduced-complexity approaches are suggested for SC-FDE of CPM signals. General full- and partial-response CPM waveforms, and specific examples of minimum-shift keying (MSK) and Gaussian MSK (GMSK) with BT=0.3 are investigated.

To this end, we examine a MIMO channel employing orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBCs) and study the diversity behavior of the resulting effective single-input single-output (SISO) channel. The performance criteria employed are symbol error rate, outage capacity, and wideband spectral efficiency. For general propagation conditions, we establish key quantities that determine performance irrespective of the performance criterion used. Furthermore, we discuss the relation between the notion of diversity order related to the slope of the average error probability versus signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) curve and diversity order related to the slope of the outage probability versus SNR curve. For Ricean fading MIMO channels, we demonstrate the existence of an SNR-dependent critical rate R/sub crit/, below which signaling with zero outage is possible and, hence, the fading channel behaves like an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. For SISO channels, R/sub crit/ is always zero. In the MIMO case, R/sub crit/ is a simple function of the angle between the vectorized Ricean component of the channel and the subspace spanned by the vectorized Rayleigh fading component.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2005.853835","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/32683/01532235.pdf","startPage":"2519","endPage":"2532","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2005.853835","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diversity and outage performance in space-time block coded Ricean MIMO channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532235","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532235/","displayDocTitle":"Diversity and outage performance in space-time block coded Ricean MIMO channels","volume":"4","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8657036","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1532235/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diversity and outage performance in space-time block coded Ricean MIMO channels","sourcePdf":"01532235.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10392S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"32683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"32683","articleId":"1532235","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1532238,"authors":[{"name":"Yuheng Huang","affiliation":["QUALCOMM, Inc.orporated, San Diego, CA, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/32683/1532238/1532238-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuheng Huang (S'01-M'04) received the B.E. degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1999, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Washington, Seattle, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.","From September 1999 to June 2004, he was a Research Assistant with the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle.

In SIED, in order to effectively prevent error propagation, the decoding proceeds until the current decoder stage converges, and only then feeds back the best achievable decoding results to refine channel estimates. The on-line convergence is detected through the soft decoding metrics (SDMs). Further, we provide a unified analytic framework for both the choice of filter length and an asymptotic bit error rate (BER) analysis, where the key parameter is the power correlation coefficient between the fading and its estimate. Simulation results verify that our SIED algorithm can successfully break the barrier of the channel estimation error caused by conventional pilot symbol-assisted modulation (PSAM), and lead the BER to approach the ideal asymptotic performance.

Relative motion between transmitter, receiver, and scattering environment induces Doppler spread. Since Doppler shift is proportional to subcarrier frequency, the time-selective fading is subcarrier dependent. In a narrowband (NB) system, this dependence is negligible, and all subcarriers are subjected to the same time-selective fading. However, in a UWB system, different subcarriers will experience different fading. In this paper, intercarrier interference (ICI) caused by the relative motion between transmitter and receiver in OFDM-based UWB communications is investigated. An exact expression as well as bounds is derived for the degradation of performance measured by signal-to-interference ratio (SIR).

Adaptive transmission can be performed on a frame-by-frame basis, provided that a channel state information (CSI), consisting of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) level as estimated by the receiver, is fed back to the transmitter, thereby allowing for different compromises between the achievable capacity and the corresponding implementation complexity. The closed-form capacity formulas, derived for different power- and rate-allocation policies, are expressed in terms of the number of transmit and receive antennas, the code rate of the STBC mapping, and a single parameter capturing Gaussian channel-estimation errors. Numerical results showing the effects of these parameters on the capacity of STBC subject to the adaptive-transmission policies under consideration are provided.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of space-time block codes in MIMO Rayleigh fading channels with adaptive transmission and estimation errors","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2005.853968","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/32683/01532240.pdf","startPage":"2568","endPage":"2578","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2005.853968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32683","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532240","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532240/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of space-time block codes in MIMO Rayleigh fading channels with adaptive transmission and estimation errors","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1532240/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8657041","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of space-time block codes in MIMO Rayleigh fading channels with adaptive transmission and estimation errors","sourcePdf":"01532240.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109683S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"32683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"32683","articleId":"1532240","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1532241,"authors":[{"name":"Y.T.

There have been extensive recent research efforts on how to design protocols and algorithms to prolong network lifetime.

In this paper, we consider the energy provisioning (EP) problem for a two-tiered wireless sensor network. In addition to provisioning additional energy on the existing nodes, we also consider deploying relay nodes (RNs) into the network to mitigate network geometric deficiencies and prolong network lifetime. We formulate the joint problem of EP and RN placement (EP-RNP) into a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. Since an MINLP problem is NP-hard in general, and even state-of-the-art software and techniques are unable to offer satisfactory solutions, we develop a heuristic algorithm, called Smart Pairing and INtelligent Disc Search (SPINDS), to address this problem. We show a number of novel algorithmic design techniques in the design of SPINDS that effectively transform a complex MINLP problem into a linear programming (LP) problem without losing critical points in its search space. Through numerical results, we show that SPINDS offers a very attractive solution and some important insights to the EP-RNP problem.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2005.853969","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/32683/01532241.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2005.853969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32683","startPage":"2579","endPage":"2590","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On energy provisioning and relay node placement for wireless sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532241","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On energy provisioning and relay node placement for wireless sensor networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532241/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"4","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8657042","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1532241/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On energy provisioning and relay node placement for wireless sensor networks","sourcePdf":"01532241.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157979S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"32683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"288","xplore-issue":"32683","articleId":"1532241","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1532243,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Xiao","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/32683/1532243/1532243-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lei Xiao (S'03) received the B.Eng. degree in information engineering from the Teaching Reform Class (TRC), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2002, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada, in 2004.

Previously published symbol error rate (SER) results for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and various fading channels, diversity reception, and imperfect channel estimation (ICE) can all be used in conjunction with the new signal-space partitioning method to obtain the desired performance measures.

As a result of this analysis, the formula for the noise floor of PE accelerometers in terms of acceleration spectral density is obtained at wide frequency band. Noise floor of the low-noise PE accelerometer comprising low-noise JFET charge amplifiers with some particular parameters of the PE transducer and the JFET amplifier was measured. The theoretical and experimental curves of the PE accelerometer's noise floor have a good correlation with each other at frequencies from 1 Hz to 10 kHz. The contribution of the different noise sources to the overall noise floor is shown. Those noise sources include the mechanical-thermal noise and electrical-thermal noise of the PE transducer and all main noise sources of FET amplifiers: the thermal noise voltage of the FET biasing resistor, the thermal noise of the series resistor between the PE transducer and the gate of the FET, the channel thermal noise voltage, the 1/f noise voltage, and the shot noise current in the gate circuit. At low frequencies, the f/spl les/50 Hz noise floor is determined mainly by the FET biasing resistor's thermal noise and the PE transducer's electrical-thermal noise. At frequencies from about 50 Hz to about 1 kHz, the contribution of the PE transducer's electrical-thermal noise dominates over the amplifier's noise sources by a factor of less than 2. At frequencies above 1 kHz, noise floor is determined mainly by the JFET channel thermal noise and the PE transducer's electrical-thermal noise.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532261/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1532261/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8654760","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"5","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Noise of piezoelectric accelerometer with integral FET amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise of piezoelectric accelerometer with integral FET amplifier","sourcePdf":"01532261.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059232S","chronDate":"Dec.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"32684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"32684","articleId":"1532261","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1532278,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The measurement of the shuttle position is made using a capacitance-to-voltage converter IC that has been developed by combining correlated double sampling with delta modulation in a fully differential circuit topology. This oversampling circuit may be adjusted to trade bandwidth (sample rate) for resolution, while reference levels may be adjusted to set the desired sensitivity to accommodate a large range of capacitive sensor interface applications. The IC was fabricated using an inexpensive, 1.5-/spl mu/m, double-metal, double-polysilicon CMOS technology, and test results demonstrate a resolution of 170 aF for a signal bandwidth of 3 kHz, a 68-dB dynamic range, and nonlinearity less than 0.16%. The converter IC was used to characterize a comb-drive, SiC lateral MEMS resonator by time-domain measurement of its shuttle-comb capacitance. Resonant frequency was found to be 16.6 kHz, independent of operating pressure, but quality factor varied from 51 at 760-Torr pressure to 6900 at 175 mTorr. The ability to accurately characterize the SiC resonator shows that the packaging approach used in this study is sufficient to interface capacitive-based MEMS devices with Si ICs in cases where on-chip integration is not feasible or possible.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Application specific integrated circuits","Time domain analysis","Micromechanical devices","Capacitance measurement","Bandwidth","Signal resolution","CMOS technology","Silicon carbide","Electronic circuits","Motion measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["micromechanical resonators","time-domain analysis","motion measurement","microsensors","capacitive sensors","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["converter integrated circuit","MEMS resonators","delta modulation","circuit topology","oversampling circuit","capacitive sensor interface","CMOS technology","time domain measurement","shuttle-comb capacitance","quality factor","3 kHz","16.6 kHz","175 mTorr","760 Torr","1.5 micron","SiC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacitor-to-voltage (C-to-V) converter","delta modulator","double sampling","microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) resonator"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2005.859236","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/32684/01532278.pdf","startPage":"1353","endPage":"1361","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32684","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2005.859236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An oversampled capacitance-to-voltage converter IC with application to time-domain characterization of MEMS resonators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532278","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An oversampled capacitance-to-voltage converter IC with application to time-domain characterization of MEMS resonators","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532278/","volume":"5","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1532278/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8654777","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An oversampled capacitance-to-voltage converter IC with application to time-domain characterization of MEMS resonators","sourcePdf":"01532278.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060505S","chronDate":"Dec.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"32684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"32684","articleId":"1532278","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1532283,"authors":[{"name":"Yahong Rosa Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Missouri, Rolla, MO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/32684/1532283/1532283-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yahong Rosa Zheng (S'99\u2013M'03) received the B.S. degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, in 1987, the M.S. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1989, and the Ph.D. degree from Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada, in 2002, all in electrical engineering.","From 1989 to 1997, she was with several companies, including the Peony Electronic Group, Beijing, China; Sagem Australasia Pty., Ltd., Sydney, Australia; and Polytronics Pty., Ltd., Toronto, ON, Canada.

A new virtual array approach is employed such that the original signals received by the array elements are weighted and delayed to synthesize a large, nonuniformly spaced, harmonically nested virtual array covering the frequency band [50, 7000] Hz of the wideband telephony. Subband multirate processing and near-field beamforming techniques are then used jointly by the nested virtual array to improve the performances in reverberant environments. A new beamforming algorithm is also proposed using a broadband near-field spherically isotropic noise model for array optimization. The near-field noise model assumes a large number of broadband random noises uniformly distributed over a sphere with a finite radius in contrast to the conventional far-field isotropic noise model which has an infinite radius. The radius of the noise model, thus, adds a design parameter in addition to its power for tradeoffs between performance and robustness. It is shown that the near-field beamformers designed by the new algorithm can achieve more than 8-dB reverberation suppression while maintaining sufficient robustness against background noises and signal location errors. Computer simulations and real room experiments also show that the proposed array beamforming system reduces beampattern variations for broadband signals, obtains strong noise and reverberation suppression, and improves the sound quality for near-field targets.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2005.858936","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/32684/01532283.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32684","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2005.858936","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","startPage":"1395","endPage":"1406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A microphone array system for multimedia applications with near-field signal targets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532283","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","displayDocTitle":"A microphone array system for multimedia applications with near-field signal targets","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532283/","volume":"5","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1532283/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8654782","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A microphone array system for multimedia applications with near-field signal targets","sourcePdf":"01532283.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081566S","chronDate":"Dec.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"32684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"32684","articleId":"1532283","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1532284,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The low test signal levels and high noise immunity of these test methods make them well suited to test for intermittent wiring failures such as open circuits, short circuits, and arcs on cables in aircraft in flight.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/32684/01532290.pdf","startPage":"1469","endPage":"1478","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2005.858964","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2005.858964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32684","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of spread spectrum time domain reflectometry for wire fault location","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spread spectrum communication","Time domain analysis","Reflectometry","Wire","Fault location","Circuit testing","Aircraft","Cables","Circuit faults","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric sensing devices","time-domain reflectometry","aircraft power systems","fault location","arcs (electric)","wires"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spread spectrum time domain reflectometry","wire fault location","sequence time domain reflectometry","aircraft wire","signal to noise ratio","AC power signal","digital signal","impedance cable","noise immunity","intermittent wiring failure","open circuits","short circuits","aging wire detection","arc detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aging wire detection","arc detection","sequence time domain reflectometry (STDR)","spread spectrum time domain reflectometry (SSTDR)","time domain reflectometry (TDR)","wire fault detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532290/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of spread spectrum time domain reflectometry for wire fault location","volume":"5","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1532290/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8654789","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of spread spectrum time domain reflectometry for wire fault location","sourcePdf":"01532290.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053681S","chronDate":"Dec.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"32684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"229","xplore-issue":"32684","articleId":"1532290","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1532291,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In this paper, we pursue a \"true\" two-dimensional transform that can capture the intrinsic geometrical structure that is key in visual information. The main challenge in exploring geometry in images comes from the discrete nature of the data. Thus, unlike other approaches, such as curvelets, that first develop a transform in the continuous domain and then discretize for sampled data, our approach starts with a discrete-domain construction and then studies its convergence to an expansion in the continuous domain. Specifically, we construct a discrete-domain multiresolution and multidirection expansion using nonseparable filter banks, in much the same way that wavelets were derived from filter banks. This construction results in a flexible multiresolution, local, and directional image expansion using contour segments, and, thus, it is named the contourlet transform. The discrete contourlet transform has a fast iterated filter bank algorithm that requires an order N operations for N-pixel images. Furthermore, we establish a precise link between the developed filter bank and the associated continuous-domain contourlet expansion via a directional multiresolution analysis framework. We show that with parabolic scaling and sufficient directional vanishing moments, contourlets achieve the optimal approximation rate for piecewise smooth functions with discontinuities along twice continuously differentiable curves. Finally, we show some numerical experiments demonstrating the potential of contourlets in several image processing applications.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2005.859376","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/32685/01532309.pdf","startPage":"2091","endPage":"2106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32685","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2005.859376","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The contourlet transform: an efficient directional multiresolution image representation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532309","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2005","displayDocTitle":"The contourlet transform: an efficient directional multiresolution image representation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532309/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8659092","pubMedId":"16370462","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1532309/","volume":"14","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The contourlet transform: an efficient directional multiresolution image representation","sourcePdf":"01532309.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107405S","chronDate":"Dec.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"32685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"2562","xplore-issue":"32685","articleId":"1532309","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":1532311,"authors":[{"name":"H.R.

The goal of quality assessment (QA) research is to design algorithms that can automatically assess the quality of images or videos in a perceptually consistent manner. Traditionally, image QA algorithms interpret image quality as fidelity or similarity with a \"reference\" or \"perfect\" image in some perceptual space. Such \"full-reference\" QA methods attempt to achieve consistency in quality prediction by modeling salient physiological and psychovisual features of the human visual system (HVS), or by arbitrary signal fidelity criteria. In this paper, we approach the problem of image QA by proposing a novel information fidelity criterion that is based on natural scene statistics. QA systems are invariably involved with judging the visual quality of images and videos that are meant for \"human consumption\". Researchers have developed sophisticated models to capture the statistics of natural signals, that is, pictures and videos of the visual environment. Using these statistical models in an information-theoretic setting, we derive a novel QA algorithm that provides clear advantages over the traditional approaches. In particular, it is parameterless and outperforms current methods in our testing. We validate the performance of our algorithm with an extensive subjective study involving 779 images. We also show that, although our approach distinctly departs from traditional HVS-based methods, it is functionally similar to them under certain conditions, yet it outperforms them due to improved modeling. The code and the data from the subjective study are available at [1].","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532311/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2005","volume":"14","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8659094","pubMedId":"16370464","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1532311/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An information fidelity criterion for image quality assessment using natural scene statistics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An information fidelity criterion for image quality assessment using natural scene statistics","sourcePdf":"01532311.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080784S","chronDate":"Dec.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"32685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"794","xplore-issue":"32685","articleId":"1532311","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1532312,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The first approach is based on image normalization, in which both watermark embedding and extraction are carried out with respect to an image normalized to meet a set of predefined moment criteria. We propose a new normalization procedure, which is invariant to affine transform attacks. The resulting watermarking scheme is suitable for public watermarking applications, where the original image is not available for watermark extraction. The second approach is based on a watermark resynchronization scheme aimed to alleviate the effects of random bending attacks. In this scheme, a deformable mesh is used to correct the distortion caused by the attack. The watermark is then extracted from the corrected image. In contrast to the first scheme, the latter is suitable for private watermarking applications, where the original image is necessary for watermark detection. In both schemes, we employ a direct-sequence code division multiple access approach to embed a multibit watermark in the discrete cosine transform domain of the image. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed watermarking schemes are robust to a wide range of geometric attacks.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2005.857263","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/32685/01532313.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2005.857263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32685","startPage":"2140","endPage":"2150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital watermarking robust to geometric distortions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532313","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Digital watermarking robust to geometric distortions","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532313/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8659096","pubMedId":"16370466","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1532313/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital watermarking robust to geometric distortions","sourcePdf":"01532313.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088083S","chronDate":"Dec.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"32685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"170","xplore-issue":"32685","articleId":"1532313","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1532316,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/32685/1532316/1532316-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lei Zhang (M'04) was born in China in 1974.

The influence of end effects is also investigated, and optimal design parameters, such as the rotor pole width, the stator tooth width, and the ratio of the inner to outer diameter of the stator, are discussed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32686","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/32686/01532337.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2005.854441","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2005.854441","startPage":"4277","endPage":"4287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of electromagnetic performance of flux-switching permanent-magnet Machines by nonlinear adaptive lumped parameter magnetic circuit model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532337/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of electromagnetic performance of flux-switching permanent-magnet Machines by nonlinear adaptive lumped parameter magnetic circuit model","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1532337/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"41","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"8664532","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of electromagnetic performance of flux-switching permanent-magnet Machines by nonlinear adaptive lumped parameter magnetic circuit model","sourcePdf":"01532337.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112221S","chronDate":"Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"32686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"485","xplore-issue":"32686","articleId":"1532337","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1532340,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

This PC-based system uses a multifunction I/O card for controller output and a high-speed digitizer card capable of sampling the frequency-encoded servo pattern at 500 MS/s. The PC, running under the Linux operating system, uses the Goertzel algorithm decoding scheme to calculate the position error signal (PES) at a 15-kHz update rate for feedback control. The control signal drives a custom-made lead zirconate titanate (PZT) actuator, which moves the suspension and thus the read/write head. A proportional and integral (PI) type servo controller supports a 1.1-kHz servo bandwidth, producing a 21.9% improvement of the positioning accuracy of the spinstand.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/32686/01532342.pdf","startPage":"4315","endPage":"4322","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2005.856304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2005.856304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32686","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PC-based position error signal generation and servo system for a spinstand","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal generators","Servomechanisms","Servosystems","Control systems","Sampling methods","Frequency","Linux","Operating systems","Decoding","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["servomechanisms","control system synthesis","computerised control","piezoelectric actuators","magnetic heads","magnetic recording","disc drives","hard discs","Linux"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PC based position error signal generation","spinstand","servo control system","frequency encoded servo pattern sampling","Linux","decoding","feedback control","actuator","1.1 kHz","15 kHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital control system","position error signal","servo control","spinstand","track misregistration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532342/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","displayDocTitle":"PC-based position error signal generation and servo system for a spinstand","volume":"41","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1532342/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"8664537","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PC-based position error signal generation and servo system for a spinstand","sourcePdf":"01532342.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050098S","chronDate":"Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"32686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"32686","articleId":"1532342","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1532344,"authors":[{"name":"P.W.

The adaptive control laws proposed in this paper are optimal with respect to a family of cost functionals. This is achieved by the inverse optimality approach, without solving the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs partial differential (HJIPD) equation directly. The design of the optimal adaptive controllers is separated into two stages by means of integrator backstepping, and a control Lyapunov argument is constructed to show that the inverse optimal adaptive controllers achieve H/sub /spl infin// disturbance attenuation with respect to external disturbances and global asymptotic convergence of tracking errors to zero for disturbances with bounded energy. The convergence of adaptive parameters is also analyzed in terms of invariant manifold. Numerical simulations illustrate the performance of the proposed control algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532394/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"50","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","accessionNumber":"8646592","htmlLink":"/document/1532394/","displayDocTitle":"Inverse optimal adaptive control for attitude tracking of spacecraft","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inverse optimal adaptive control for attitude tracking of spacecraft","sourcePdf":"01532394.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103945S","chronDate":"Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"32688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"285","xplore-issue":"32688","articleId":"1532394","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":1532398,"authors":[{"name":"Minyue Fu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/32688/1532398/1532398-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Minyue Fu (S'84\u2013M'87\u2013SM'94\u2013F'02) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, in 1982, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, in 1983 and 1987, respectively.","From 1983 to 1987, he held a teaching assistantship and a research assistantship at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.

It is known that as long as users do not anticipate the effect of their actions on prices, a simple proportional pricing mechanism can maximize the sum of users' utilities minus the cost (called aggregate surplus). Continuing previous efforts to quantify the effects of selfish behavior in network pricing mechanisms, we consider the possibility that users anticipate the effect of their actions on link prices. Under the assumption that the links' marginal cost functions are convex, we establish existence of a Nash equilibrium. We show that the aggregate surplus at a Nash equilibrium is no worse than a factor of 4/spl radic/2-5 times the optimal aggregate surplus; thus, the efficiency loss when users are selfish is no more than approximately 34%.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32688","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2005.858687","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2005.858687","startPage":"1712","endPage":"1724","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/32688/01532399.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532399","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532399/","displayDocTitle":"Efficiency loss in a network resource allocation game: the case of elastic supply","volume":"50","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"8646596","publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1532399/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficiency loss in a network resource allocation game: the case of elastic supply","sourcePdf":"01532399.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101015S","chronDate":"Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"32688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"32688","articleId":"1532399","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1532404,"authors":[{"name":"Xidong Tang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA"],"lastName":"Xidong Tang","id":"37336433800"},{"name":"Gang Tao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA"],"lastName":"Gang Tao","id":"37271399900"},{"name":"S.M.

Moreover, it is shown that for a class of nonlinear time-delay systems with triangular structure the adaptive stabilizing controller can be obtained by recursively constructing the Lyapunov-Razumikhin function. It will be shown that the provided recursive design approach, which is obviously motivated by the typical backstepping method, is not a trivial extension of the existing design method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/32688/01532431.pdf","startPage":"1909","endPage":"1913","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2005.854652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2005.854652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32688","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive feedback control of nonlinear time-delay systems: the LaSalle-Razumikhin-based approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Feedback control","Design methodology","Sufficient conditions","Stability","Differential equations","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Backstepping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","feedback","nonlinear control systems","delay systems","stability","Lyapunov methods","control system synthesis","differential equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive feedback control","nonlinear time-delay systems","LaSalle-Razumikhin functions","functional differential equations","adaptive stabilization problem","recursive design approach","backstepping method","Lyapunov-Razumikhin function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive control","functional differential equation","Lyapunov\u2013Razumikhin function","nonlinear system","time-delay"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532431/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive feedback control of nonlinear time-delay systems: the LaSalle-Razumikhin-based approach","volume":"50","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1532431/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"8656001","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive feedback control of nonlinear time-delay systems: the LaSalle-Razumikhin-based approach","sourcePdf":"01532431.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059539S","chronDate":"Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"32688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"134","xplore-issue":"32688","articleId":"1532431","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1532443,"authors":[{"name":"F.

We illustrate that space-time cooperation can greatly reduce the error rates of all the nodes involved, even for poor interuser channel quality.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2005.858641","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/32690/01532475.pdf","startPage":"1804","endPage":"1809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2005.858641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32690","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative space-time coding for wireless networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532475/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative space-time coding for wireless networks","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1532475/","accessionNumber":"8656821","volume":"53","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative space-time coding for wireless networks","sourcePdf":"01532475.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043482S","chronDate":"Nov. 2005","isNumber":"32690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"103","articleId":"1532475","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1532476,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Jun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, NT, Hong Kong"],"lastName":"Ying Jun Zhang","id":"37279969700"},{"name":"K.B.

The proposed algorithm endeavors to maximize the system power efficiency, given that the users' quality of service (QoS) requirements, specified by bit-error rate and data rate, are satisfied. Subcarrier allocation, power distribution, and modulation for multiple users are jointly optimized according to users' channel states and QoS requirements. To avoid the joint optimization of resource allocation and beamforming, matched-filter-based receivers are employed at the base station, with cochannel interference being mitigated through dynamic subchannel allocation. A neighborhood search scheme is further developed to obtain a good allocation solution with reasonable computational efforts. Our results show that the proposed algorithm is able to achieve significant enhancement in the system power efficiency due to the successful exploitation of multiuser diversity, as well as channel variations in the time, frequency, and space domains.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/32690/01532476.pdf","startPage":"1810","endPage":"1816","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2005.858665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2005.858665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32690","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive resource allocation for multiaccess MIMO/OFDM systems with matched filtering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","MIMO","OFDM","Adaptive filters","Matched filters","Quality of service","Filtering","Frequency division multiplexing","Bit error rate","Power distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","MIMO systems","OFDM modulation","matched filters","filtering theory","quality of service","error statistics","wireless channels","cochannel interference","interference suppression","multiuser channels","diversity reception","adaptive modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive resource allocation algorithm","multiaccess MIMO-OFDM system","matched filtering","multiple-input multiple-output","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","QoS","quality of service","bit error rate","BER","subcarrier allocation","power distribution","cochannel interference","interference mitigation","subchannel allocation","diversity reception","adaptive modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive modulation","adaptive resource allocation","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532476/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive resource allocation for multiaccess MIMO/OFDM systems with matched filtering","volume":"53","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1532476/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"8656822","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive resource allocation for multiaccess MIMO/OFDM systems with matched filtering","sourcePdf":"01532476.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104025S","chronDate":"Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"32690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"32690","articleId":"1532476","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1532477,"authors":[{"name":"Minh-Tuan Le","affiliation":["CEL Laboratory, School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Minh-Tuan Le","id":"37290387200"},{"name":"Van-Su Pham","affiliation":["CEL Laboratory, School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Van-Su Pham","id":"37298061300"},{"name":"Linh Mai","affiliation":["CEL Laboratory, School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Linh Mai","id":"37294227300"},{"name":"Giwan Yoon","affiliation":["CEL Laboratory, School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Giwan Yoon","id":"37301967300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"1532477","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":323},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"This letter proposes a very low-complexity maximum-likelihood (ML) detection algorithm based on QR decomposition for the quasi-orthogonal space-time block code (QSTBC) with four transmit antennas, called the LC-ML decoder.

Since performance of channel codes is influenced in different ways by different components of channel-estimation errors, we develop a simplified model which separates the estimation errors of a Wiener-filtered received signal into the amplitude error and the phase error. Based on the model, we derive tight bounds on component error variances. Moreover, we prove that the classical Wiener filter results in a biased estimate of the channel amplitude. We also show that the probability of having a phase-estimation error large enough to cause decision errors in the receiver is significant. Using our model, we derive an approximate upper limit on the optimum pilot-symbol spacing and approximate lower limit on bit-error rate performance of coded systems with a given pilot-symbol separation. The proposed model and derivations are confirmed by extensive simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2005.858669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32690","startPage":"1822","endPage":"1832","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/32690/01532478.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2005.858669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling fading channel-estimation errors in pilot-symbol-assisted systems, with application to turbo codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Turbo codes","Channel estimation","Wiener filter","Iterative decoding","Iterative methods","Amplitude estimation","Communication systems","Signal to noise ratio","Iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Rayleigh channels","channel estimation","turbo codes","channel coding","Wiener filters","phase estimation","amplitude estimation","error statistics","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channel-estimation error modeling","pilot-symbol-assisted system","turbo code","fading channel","channel code","Wiener filter","amplitude error","phase error","phase estimation","BER","bit error rate","phase offset","Rayleigh channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel-estimation error","phase offset","Rayleigh channel","turbo codes","Wiener filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Modeling fading channel-estimation errors in pilot-symbol-assisted systems, with application to turbo codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532478/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1532478/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8656824","publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling fading channel-estimation errors in pilot-symbol-assisted systems, with application to turbo codes","sourcePdf":"01532478.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069132S","chronDate":"Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"32690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"32690","articleId":"1532478","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1532480,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Nonsystematic turbo codes can achieve lower error floors than systematic turbo codes because of their superior effective free distance properties. Moreover, they can achieve comparable performance in the waterfall region if the nonsystematic constituent encoder has a low-weight feedforward inverse. A uniform interleaver analysis is used to show that rate R=1/3 turbo codes using nonsystematic constituent encoders have larger effective free distances than when systematic constituent encoders are used. Also, mutual information-based transfer characteristics and extrinsic information transfer charts are used to show that rate R=1/3 turbo codes with nonsystematic constituent encoders having low-weight feedforward inverses achieve convergence thresholds comparable to those achieved with systematic constituent encoders.

This is often done in conjunction with a time-domain equalizer (TEQ) for reducing the capacity overhead caused by the CP. However, the use of TEQ greatly increases the computational cost, and is unable to eliminate the need for the CP. In this paper, we propose a subband approach to channel estimation and channel equalization for DMT and OFDM systems. This approach involves splitting the received signals into a number of frequency bands (called subbands), and estimating a constant parameter in each subband. The subband approach is conceptually simple, requires no CP, is much more numerically efficient than the TEQ method, and gives compatible or better estimation errors than the CP-based methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/32690/01532481.pdf","startPage":"1850","endPage":"1858","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2005.858671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2005.858671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32690","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A subband approach to channel estimation and equalization for DMT and OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM modulation","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Frequency division multiplexing","Equalizers","Computational efficiency","Frequency estimation","DSL","Phase modulation","Amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","equalisers","OFDM modulation","adaptive filters","filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subband approach","channel estimation","channel equalization","DMT system","OFDM system","cyclic prefix","discrete multitone","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","time-domain equalizer","signal splitting","parameter estimation","subband adaptive filtering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete multitone (DMT)","equalization","multicarrier","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","subband adaptive filtering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532481/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","displayDocTitle":"A subband approach to channel estimation and equalization for DMT and OFDM systems","volume":"53","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1532481/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"8656827","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A subband approach to channel estimation and equalization for DMT and OFDM systems","sourcePdf":"01532481.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.174769S","chronDate":"Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"32690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"32690","articleId":"1532481","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1532483,"authors":[{"name":"N.

In this paper, we propose a new iterative block DFE (IBDFE) which operates iteratively on blocks of the received signal. Indeed, a suitable data-transmission format must be used to allow an efficient implementation of the equalizer in the frequency domain, by means of the discrete Fourier transform. Two design methods are considered. In the first method, hard detected data are used as input of the feedback, and filters are designed according to the correlation between detected and transmitted data. In the second method, the feedback signal is directly designed from soft detection of the equalized signal at the previous iteration. Estimators of the parameters involved in the IBDFE design are also derived. From performance simulations on a wireless dispersive fading channel, we observed that the IBDFE outperforms existing DFEs. Moreover, the IBDFE exhibits a reduction of the computational complexity when compared against existing schemes, both in signal processing and in filter design.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2005.858666","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/32690/01532483.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2005.858666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32690","startPage":"1867","endPage":"1875","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative design and detection of a DFE in the frequency domain","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532483","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Iterative design and detection of a DFE in the frequency domain","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532483/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"8656829","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1532483/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative design and detection of a DFE in the frequency domain","sourcePdf":"01532483.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074961S","chronDate":"Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"32690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"193","xplore-issue":"32690","articleId":"1532483","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1532485,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The utility function measures the number of reliable bits transmitted by the user per joule of energy consumed. Focusing on linear receivers, the Nash equilibrium for the proposed game is derived. It is shown that the equilibrium is one where the powers are signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio-balanced with the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) detector as the receiver. In addition, this framework is used to study power-control games for the matched filter, the decorrelator, and the MMSE detector; and the receivers' performance is compared in terms of the utilities achieved at equilibrium (in bits/joule). The optimal cooperative solution is also discussed and compared with the noncooperative approach. Extensions of the results to the case of multiple receive antennas are also presented.

In the proposed schemes, the source node sends coded information bits to both the relay and the destination nodes, while the relay simultaneously forwards its estimate for the previous coded block to the destination after decoding and re-encoding. The destination observes a superposition of the codewords and uses an iterative decoding algorithm to estimate the transmitted messages. Different from the block-by-block decoding techniques used in the literature, this decoding scheme operates over all the transmitted blocks jointly. Various encoding and decoding approaches are proposed for both single-input single-output and multi-input multi-output systems over several different channel models. Capacity bounds and information-rate bounds with binary inputs are also provided, and it is shown that the performance of the proposed practical scheme is typically about 1.0-1.5 dB away from the theoretical limits, and a remarkable advantage can be achieved over the direct and multihop transmission alternatives.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2005.858654","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/32690/01532486.pdf","startPage":"1895","endPage":"1905","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2005.858654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32690","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity-approaching turbo coding and iterative decoding for relay channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532486/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Capacity-approaching turbo coding and iterative decoding for relay channels","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1532486/","accessionNumber":"8656832","volume":"53","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity-approaching turbo coding and iterative decoding for relay channels","sourcePdf":"01532486.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085021S","chronDate":"Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"32690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"32690","articleId":"1532486","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1532488,"authors":[{"name":"Daeyoung Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science #029, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/32690/1532488/1532488-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daeyoung Park (S'00-M'05) received the B.S. and M.E. degrees in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer science, all from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea. in 1998. 2000. and 2004. resoectively.","Since 2004, he has been a Senior Engineer with Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT), Suwon, Korea, where he has been working on nextgeneration wireless systems.

This cdf-based scheduling (CS) algorithm selects the user for transmission based on the cdf of user rates, in such a way that the user whose rate is high enough, but least probable to become higher, is selected first. We prove that the CS algorithm is equivalent to a scheduling algorithm that regards the user rates as independent and identically distributed, and the average throughput of a user is independent of the probability distribution of other users. So, we can evaluate the exact user throughput only if we know the user's own distribution, which is a distinctive feature of this proposed algorithm. In addition, we try a modification on the CS algorithm to limit the maximum starving time, and prove that the modification does not affect the average interservice time. This CS with starving-time limitation (CS-STL) algorithm turns out to limit the maximum starving time at the cost of a negligible throughput loss.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2005.858675","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/32690/01532488.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2005.858675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32690","startPage":"1919","endPage":"1929","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless packet scheduling based on the cumulative distribution function of user transmission rates","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532488","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wireless packet scheduling based on the cumulative distribution function of user transmission rates","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532488/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"8656834","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1532488/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless packet scheduling based on the cumulative distribution function of user transmission rates","sourcePdf":"01532488.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081496S","chronDate":"Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"32690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"32690","articleId":"1532488","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1532489,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The transmission medium is characterized by multipath propagation, and the goal is to estimate the time-varying channel impulse response (CIR) for a new user entering the system. Channel acquisition is pursued through maximum-likelihood techniques. The resulting scheme may be too complex in some applications, as it requires the online inversion of a large matrix. Therefore, we also consider a simpler solution based on the least-squares (LS) criterion. Channel tracking is performed through weighted LS methods. At each signaling interval, the CIR estimate is updated using data decisions and exploiting the inverse of the interference covariance matrix to mitigate the near-far problem. Performance is assessed by simulation in a scenario inspired by the frequency-division duplexing component of the universal mobile telecommunications system. The acquisition/tracking algorithms are found to be resistant to multiuser interference and suitable for transmissions over fast-fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2005.858690","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/32690/01532489.pdf","startPage":"1930","endPage":"1939","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2005.858690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32690","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel acquisition and tracking for DS-CDMA uplink transmissions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532489","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532489/","displayDocTitle":"Channel acquisition and tracking for DS-CDMA uplink transmissions","volume":"53","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"8656835","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1532489/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel acquisition and tracking for DS-CDMA uplink transmissions","sourcePdf":"01532489.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083943S","chronDate":"Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"32690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"32690","articleId":"1532489","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1532492,"authors":[{"name":"Liuqing Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/32690/1532492/1532492-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liuqing Yang (M'04) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 1994, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, in 2002 and 2004, respectively.","Since August 2004, she has been an Assistant Professor with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville.

In this paper, we establish a novel synchronization criterion that we term \"timing with dirty templates\" (TDT), based on which we develop and test timing algorithms in both data-aided (DA) and nondata-aided modes. For the DA mode, we design a training pattern, which turns out to not only speed up synchronization, but also enable timing in a multiuser environment. Based on simple integrate-and-dump operations over the symbol duration, our TDT algorithms remain operational in practical UWB settings. They are also readily applicable to narrowband systems when intersymbol interference is avoided.

The answer is a soft limiter with gain calculated based on the noise power and the probability density function of the input amplitude.

These codes have encoding advantage over other types of LDPC codes. This paper addresses the issue of efficient encoding of QC-LDPC codes. Two methods are presented to find the generator matrices of QC-LDPC codes in systematic-circulant form from their parity-check matrices given in circulant form. Based on the systematic-circulation form of the generator matrix of a QC-LDPC code, various types of encoding circuits using simple shift registers are devised. It is shown that the encoding complexity of a QC-LDPC code is linearly proportional to the number of parity bits of the code for serial encoding, and to the length of the code for high-speed parallel encoding.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2005.858628","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/32690/01532496.pdf","startPage":"1973","endPage":"1973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32690","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2005.858628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Encoding of Quasi-Cyclic Low-Density Parity-Check Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532496","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2005","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Encoding of Quasi-Cyclic Low-Density Parity-Check Codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532496/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","isJournal":true,"volume":"53","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Encoding of Quasi-Cyclic Low-Density Parity-Check Codes","sourcePdf":"01532496.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035439S","chronDate":"Nov.  2005","isNumber":"32690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"30","articleId":"1532496","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1532512,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering (SITE), University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada"],"lastName":"Wei Zhang","id":"37087173341"},{"name":"C.

In this paper, a novel SISO iterative detector which employs a decorrelator on the output of soft interference cancellation is proposed. By making use of the advantages of decorrelating detection, the performance of the proposed system is improved with only a small complexity increase compared with pure soft interference cancellation. The performance improvement is reflected in lower bit error rates at low signal-to-noise ratios and in the higher convergence speed. Therefore, the proposed iterative detector is especially suitable for highly correlated narrowband systems and heavily loaded code-division multiple access (CDMA) systems. Both performance analysis and simulation results are providedto show this improvement. Finally, the computational complexity of the detector is analyzed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Iterative decoding","Narrowband","Multiaccess communication","Detectors","Decorrelation","Interference cancellation","System performance","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CJECE.2003.1532512","publicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/9754/32694/01532512.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"80","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32694","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CJECE.2003.1532512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative multiuser detection and decoding for highly correlated narrowband systems and heavily loaded CDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532512","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Iterative multiuser detection and decoding for highly correlated narrowband systems and heavily loaded CDMA systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532512/","volume":"28","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2003","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1532512/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2003","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2003","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative multiuser detection and decoding for highly correlated narrowband systems and heavily loaded CDMA systems","sourcePdf":"01532512.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036604S","chronDate":"April  2003","xplore-pub-id":"9754","isNumber":"32694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9754","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"32694","articleId":"1532512","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1532513,"authors":[{"name":"Q.M.

Transmissions from 10 commercial VHF FM transmitters operating under varying environmental conditions are analyzed using an experimental setup. It is observed that a change in environmental conditions such as battery voltage or ambient temperature causes the feature vectors to spread over the feature space, resulting in classification performance degradation. It is experimentally shown that performance degradation resulting from changing environmental conditions can be compensated for by training the system with data collected in a range of battery-voltage and ambient temperature levels. The signal-to-noise ratio versus probability of correct classification is also determined for systems operating in noisy channels in order to obtain a confidence measure for the classification decision to be made. The transient features are extracted using a technique based on the amplitudes and phase changes of the received signals. This technique is well suited to radio-transmitter turn-on transient signals, and classification with these features, as shown, outperforms current techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/9754/32696/01532524.pdf","startPage":"203","endPage":"209","publicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CJECE.2004.1532524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CJECE.2004.1532524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32696","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An experimental performance evaluation of a novel radio-transmitter identification system under diverse environmental conditions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio transmitters","Signal processing","Batteries","Degradation","Signal to noise ratio","Feature extraction","Data mining","Fingerprint recognition","Neurotransmitters","Frequency modulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532524/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2004","displayDocTitle":"An experimental performance evaluation of a novel radio-transmitter identification system under diverse environmental conditions","volume":"29","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1532524/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2004","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An experimental performance evaluation of a novel radio-transmitter identification system under diverse environmental conditions","sourcePdf":"01532524.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061455S","chronDate":"July  2004","xplore-pub-id":"9754","isNumber":"32696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9754","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"32696","articleId":"1532524","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":1532540,"authors":[{"name":"Wenhua Yu","affiliation":["Electromagnetic Communication Laboratory, Pennsylvania State University, Harrisburg, University Park, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/74/32695/1532540/1532540-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wenhua Yu is a Visiting Professor in the Pennsylvania State University Department of Electrical Engineering.

The Method of Moments (MoM)-based IE3D software was used to simulate the results for return loss, VSWR, the Smith chart, and the radiation patterns. A tunnel-based artificial neural network (ANN) was also developed to calculate the radiation patterns of the antenna. The radiation patterns were measured experimentally at 10.5 GHz and 12 GHz. The experimental results were in good agreement with the simulated results from IE3D and those of the artificial neural network. A new method of using a genetic algorithm (GA) in an artificial neural network is also discussed. This new method was used to calculate the resonant frequency of a single-shorting-post microstrip antenna. The resonant frequency calculated using the genetic-algorithm-coupled artificial neural network was compared with the analytical and experimental results. The results obtained were in very good agreement with the experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/MAP.2005.1532541","startPage":"60","endPage":"65","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/74/32695/01532541.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAP.2005.1532541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32695","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a wideband microstrip antenna and the use of artificial neural networks in parameter calculation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadband antennas","Microstrip antennas","Artificial neural networks","Intelligent networks","Genetic algorithms","Antenna radiation patterns","Bandwidth","Slot antennas","Resonant frequency","Multi-layer neural network"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband antennas","microstrip antennas","neural nets","slot antennas","multifrequency antennas","method of moments","antenna radiation patterns","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband microstrip antenna design","parameter calculation","multislot hole-coupled microstrip antenna","multifrequency antenna","method of moment","Smith chart","antenna radiation pattern","tunnel-based artificial neural network","genetic algorithm","resonant frequency","microstrip antenna","slot antenna"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532541/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2005","displayDocTitle":"Design of a wideband microstrip antenna and the use of artificial neural networks in parameter calculation","volume":"47","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1532541/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2005","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2005","accessionNumber":"8649557","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a wideband microstrip antenna and the use of artificial neural networks in parameter calculation","sourcePdf":"1532541.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074436S","chronDate":"June  2005","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"32695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"32695","articleId":"1532541","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1532603,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The proposed scheme is highly robust to time variation of wireless channels. In addition, it is equivalent to the conventional two-dimensional (2-D) minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimator, but with greatly reduced computational complexity. The reduction in complexity is achieved by employing the 2-D inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT), 2-D FFT, and a 2-D weighting function instead of a 2-D filter. The weighting function is derived based on the mean square error (MSE) criterion and is simple to implement. For cases where channel statistics are not available, a robust estimator based on a simple 2-D windowing function is proposed. Furthermore, an enhanced channel estimator that can further improve the performance of the robust estimator is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed robust and enhanced estimators are highly effective for realistic situations without the need for channel statistics.","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/9754/32697/01532603.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"28","publicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CJECE.2005.1532603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CJECE.2005.1532603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32697","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1532603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust pilot-symbol-aided channel estimator for OFDM wireless communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","OFDM","Wireless communication","Mean square error methods","Statistics","Frequency estimation","Frequency division multiplexing","Two dimensional displays","Computational complexity","Fast Fourier transforms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532603/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Winter  2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Winter  2005","displayDocTitle":"A robust pilot-symbol-aided channel estimator for OFDM wireless communications","volume":"30","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1532603/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Winter 2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust pilot-symbol-aided channel estimator for OFDM wireless communications","sourcePdf":"01532603.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07396S","chronDate":"Winter  2005","xplore-pub-id":"9754","isNumber":"32697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9754","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"32697","articleId":"1532603","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1532606,"authors":[{"name":"Xizhen Tian","affiliation":["University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Xizhen Tian","id":"37087180995"},{"name":"L.

The design is the first to have a photodiode mounted directly on the MMIC chip. The p-i-n preamplifier displays a measured average equivalent input noise current density of 24 pA/Hz. Good agreement is obtained between the predicted and measured noise performance. The monolithic eight-stage distributed amplifier is implemented using Nortels GaAs HBT (fT = 70 GHz) process, and makes use of a coplanar waveguide regime having a large input impedance optimized for noise performance and bandwidth. The p-i-n photodiode employed is an InGaAs vertically illuminated structure, also from Nortel. While the voltage gain of the amplifier displays a 3 dB bandwidth extending to nearly 40 GHz, the bandwidth of the complete optical receiver is found to be only 22 GHz. Packaging effects are believed to be responsible for this shrinkage.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32697","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CJECE.2005.1532606","publicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/9754/32697/01532606.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"54","doi":"10.1109/CJECE.2005.1532606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise performance of a preamplifier for high-speed optical receiver front-ends","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Winter  2005","displayDocTitle":"Noise performance of a preamplifier for high-speed optical receiver front-ends","volume":"30","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1532606/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Winter 2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532606/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Winter  2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise performance of a preamplifier for high-speed optical receiver front-ends","sourcePdf":"01532606.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038762S","chronDate":"Winter  2005","xplore-pub-id":"9754","isNumber":"32697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9754","xplore-issue":"32697","articleId":"1532606","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1532610,"authors":[{"name":"Du Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, California State University, Sacramento, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Du Zhang","id":"37366579400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9136-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1532610","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":36},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ontologies","Intelligent systems","Context","Knowledge acquisition","Multivalued logic","Knowledge based systems","Computer science","Problem-solving","Taxonomy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge based systems","programming language semantics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fixpoint semantics","rule-base anomaly","intelligent system","Knowledge base development","domain analysis","context space definition","ontological specification","knowledge acquisition","knowledge codification","knowledge verification","multi-valued logic","knowledge base verification"]}],"abstract":"A crucial component of an intelligent system is its knowledge base that contains knowledge about a problem domain. Knowledge base development involves domain analysis, context space definition, ontological specification, and knowledge acquisition, codification and verification. Knowledge base anomalies can affect the correctness and performance of an intelligent system. In this paper, we adopt a fixpoint semantics that is based on a multi-valued logic for a knowledge base. We then use the fixpoint semantics to provide formal definitions for four types of knowledge base anomalies: inconsistency, redundancy, incompleteness, circularity. We believe such formal definitions of knowledge base anomalies helps pave the way for a more effective knowledge base verification process.","doi":"10.1109/COGINF.2005.1532610","publicationTitle":"Fourth IEEE Conference on Cognitive Informatics, 2005.

Next, consequences (brand limitations of visualization are discussed (including the use of alternative methods, high initial costs, subjective/less, and the role of interaction), as well as examples of the use of the model for the judgement of existing classes of methods and understanding why they are or are not used in practice. Furthermore, two alternative views on visualization are presented and discussed: viewing visualization as an art or as a scientific discipline. Implications and future directions are identified.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 Oct. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532781/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1532781/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8749210","conferenceDate":"23-28 Oct. 2005","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The value of visualization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The value of visualization","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"01532781.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067631S","chronDate":"23-28 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10269","isNumber":"32702","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10269","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"32702","articleId":"1532781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":1532788,"authors":[{"name":"L.

It provides a general infrastructure that can be combined with existing visualization systems and libraries. A key component of VisTrails is the visualization trail (vistrail), a formal specification of a pipeline. Unlike existing dataflow-based systems, in VisTrails there is a clear separation between the specification of a pipeline and its execution instances. This separation enables powerful scripting capabilities and provides a scalable mechanism for generating a large number of visualizations. VisTrails also leverages the vistrail specification to identify and avoid redundant operations. This optimization is especially useful while exploring multiple visualizations. When variations of the same pipeline need to be executed, substantial speedups can be obtained by caching the results of overlapping subsequences of the pipelines. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of VisTrails, and show its effectiveness in different application scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532788/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 Oct. 2005","publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 Oct. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1532788/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2005","accessionNumber":"8749217","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"VisTrails: enabling interactive multiple-view visualizations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VisTrails: enabling interactive multiple-view visualizations","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"01532788.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066024S","chronDate":"23-28 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10269","isNumber":"32702","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10269","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"32702","articleId":"1532788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1532815,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The hardware accelerated solutions are accurate enough to enable scientists to explore the experimental design space with greater efficiency than the methods currently in use. An unsorted hexahedron projection algorithm is presented for curvilinear hexahedral meshes that produces simulated radiographs in the absorption-only regime. A sorted tetrahedral projection algorithm is presented that simulates radiographs of emissive materials.

Our size reduction techniques are based on sampling, where only a sample instead of the full network is visualized. We propose a randomized notion of \"focus\" that specifies a part of the network and the degree to which it needs to be magnified. Visualizing a sample allows our method to overcome the scalability issues inherent in visualizing massive networks. We report some characteristics that frequently occur in large networks and the conditions under which they are preserved when sampling from a network. This can be useful in selecting a proper sampling scheme that yields a sample with similar characteristics as the original network. Our method is built on top of a relational database, thus it can be easily and efficiently implemented using any off-the-shelf database software. As a proof of concept, we implement our methods and report some of our experiments over the movie database and the connectivity graph of the Web.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32702","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2005.1532819","publicationTitle":"VIS 05.

As a powerful learning tool, increasingly neural networks have been adopted by many large-scale information processing applications but there is no a set of well defined criteria for choosing a neural network. The user mostly treats a neural network as a black box and cannot explain how learning from input data was done nor how performance can be consistently ensured. We have experimented with several information visualization designs aiming to open the black box to possibly uncover underlying dependencies between the input data and the output data of a neural network. In this paper, we present our designs and show that the visualizations not only help us design more efficient neural networks, but also assist us in the process of using neural networks for problem solving such as performing a classification task.","doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2005.1532820","startPage":"383","endPage":"390","publicationTitle":"VIS 05.

Every LCMS data point has three attributes: time, mass, and intensity. Instead of the traditional visualization of two-dimensional subsets of the data, we visualize it as a height field or terrain in 3D. Unlike traditional terrains, LCMS data has non-linear sampling and consists mainly of tall needle-like features. We adapt the level-of-detail techniques of geometry clipmaps for hardware-accelerated rendering of LCMS data. The data is cached in video memory as a set of nested rectilinear grids centered about the view frustum. We introduce a simple compression scheme and dynamically stream data from the CPU to the GPU as the viewpoint moves. Our system allows interactive investigation of complex LCMS data with close to one billion data points at up to 130 frames per second, depending on the view conditions.","doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.2005.1532827","publicationTitle":"VIS 05.

The main drawback of using minimization of output error entropy for adaptive system training is the computational load when fixed-size kernel estimates are employed. Entropy estimators based on sample spacing, on the other hand, have lower computational cost, however they are not differentiable, which makes them unsuitable for adaptive learning. In this paper, a nonparametric entropy estimator that blends the desirable properties of both techniques in a variable-size finite-support kernel estimation methodology is presented. This yields an estimator suitable for adaptation, yet has computational complexity similar to sample spacing techniques. The estimator is illustrated in supervised adaptive system training using the minimum error entropy criterion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532876/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-28 Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-28 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1532876/","accessionNumber":"8724472","displayDocTitle":"Supervised Neural Network Training using the Minimum Error Entropy Criterion with Variable-Size and Finite-Support Kernel Estimates","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supervised Neural Network Training using the Minimum Error Entropy Criterion with Variable-Size and Finite-Support Kernel Estimates","confLoc":"Mystic, CT, USA","sourcePdf":"01532876.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053029S","chronDate":"28-28 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10270","isNumber":"32703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10270","xplore-issue":"32703","articleId":"1532876","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1532882,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We report some interesting properties of the WDCTC when compared to the MFCC: its statistical distribution is more Gaussian-like with lower variance, it obtains better vowel cluster separability, it forms tighter vowel clusters and generates better codebooks. Further, we employ the WDCTC and MFCC features in a 5-vowel recognition task using vector quantization (VQ), 1-nearest neighbour (1-NN), probabilistic neural network (PNN) and Gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA) as classifiers.

The decision statistic used in this novel method is derived from ideas on kernel-based learning theory and in fact, is a generalization of the correlation statistic used in the matched filter. The optimality of the matched filter is merely based on second order statistics and hence leaves room for improvement, especially when the assumption of Gaussianity is no longer valid. The proposed method incorporates higher order moments in the decision statistic and shows different behavior than the matched filter and improvement in the detection rate for non-Gaussian noise. Moreover, unlike kernel based approaches, this method is still computationally tractable and can easily be implemented in real-time","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1532925/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-28 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8724487","htmlLink":"/document/1532925/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2005","conferenceDate":"28-28 Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Correntropy Based Matched Filtering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correntropy Based Matched Filtering","confLoc":"Mystic, CT, USA","sourcePdf":"01532925.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110907S","chronDate":"28-28 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10270","isNumber":"32703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10270","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"32703","articleId":"1532925","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1532961,"authors":[{"name":"E.K.

This criterion is based on a velocity change upon application of a thin conducting sheet to the surface. Plots of surface wave velocity for various orientations of the crystal surface are presented as a function of propagation direction for the conducting sheet in contact with and infinitely far removed from the crystal surface. A plot of a typical velocity variation as a function of height of the conducting sheet is also presented. Evidence in support of the criterion of using velocity changes as an indicator of efficiency is presented in the form of mechanical displacement and electric potential plots for several orientations and propagation directions. All velocity displacements and potential calculations were carried out under the assumption that the crystal medium was lithium niobate.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32786","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sonics and Ultrasonics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sonics and Ultrasonics","pdfPath":"/iel5/10326/32786/01538474.pdf","doi":"10.1109/T-SU.1968.29477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-SU.1968.29477","startPage":"209","endPage":"217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A method for estimating optimal crystal cuts and propagation directions for excitation of piezoelectric surface waves","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1968","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1968","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1538474/","displayDocTitle":"A method for estimating optimal crystal cuts and propagation directions for excitation of piezoelectric surface waves","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2005","publicationDate":"Oct. 1968","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method for estimating optimal crystal cuts and propagation directions for excitation of piezoelectric surface waves","sourcePdf":"01538474.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065576S","chronDate":"Oct.  1968","isNumber":"32786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10326","citationCount":"541","articleId":"1538474","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1538483,"authors":[{"name":"E.K.

A physical picture of this familliar interaction process is given that applies to piezoelectric semiconductors as well as to layered structures in which acoustic wave and movmg earners are phystcally separated. In any of these systems, an acoustic wave is accompanied by a space charge wave, a sinusoidal pattern of electric charges. Such a charge pattern has a relaxation time that depends strongly on system geometry. It is shown that once the relaxation time is known, gain or loss as a function of frequency, carrier drift velocity, and electromechanical coupling factor can be found by a stmple method based on physical intuition.","doi":"10.1109/T-SU.1971.29605","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sonics and Ultrasonics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sonics and Ultrasonics","pdfPath":"/iel5/10326/32797/01538610.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-SU.1971.29605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32797","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple theory of acoustic amplification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1538610/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1971","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1971","displayDocTitle":"Simple theory of acoustic amplification","volume":"18","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1971","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple theory of acoustic amplification","sourcePdf":"01538610.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115787S","chronDate":"July  1971","isNumber":"32797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10326","citationCount":"72","articleId":"1538610","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1538613,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.

As is made evident using the transmission line model of Krimholtz, Leedom, and Matthaei, the finite thickness of the piezoelectric material must be taken into account in the matching layer design. Criteria for optimum broad-band transducer designs with a given piezoelectric material are developed which show the importance of a high electromechanical coupling coefficient. A method for obtaining Gaussian shaped passbands, necessary for optimum impulse response, is also shown.

The observation range of 10 cm is divided into 128 depth channels, thus offering the unique possibility of simultaneously recording the blood vessel geometry as well as the blood flow topography, where topography is defined as a two-dimensional map of blood flow velocity along the axis of a blood vessel. The apparatus consists of three major sections: a) Transmitter/receiver and mixer which produce a range phase signal containing the velocity information. b) The range phase signal is sampled, digitized, and stored into 128 memory ceDs for further processing. A feedback circuit significantly reduces the required resolution of the analog to digital converter and at the same time suppresses unwanted low-frequency signals. c) A frequency discriminator yields a voltage proportional to the velocity in each channel. The system can detect SOvelocity profiles per second, sufficient to characterize the pulsatile flow in arteries. The main features of the novel instrument are minimal hardware due to sequential signal processing, ease of operation, and a variety of display modes, including two-dimensional (2D) flow maps. The results, obtained in laboratory tests under simulated conditions as weD as in transcutaneous applications, agree weD with those reported by other investigators using conventional equipment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1539105/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1978","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1978","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2005","publicationDate":"Sept. 1978","volume":"25","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Topoflow - A digital full range Doppler velocity meter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topoflow - A digital full range Doppler velocity meter","sourcePdf":"01539105.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027873S","chronDate":"Sept.  1978","isNumber":"32833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10326","citationCount":"72","articleId":"1539105","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1539109,"authors":[{"name":"P.S.

The various areas of EW are defined before restricting the discussion predominantly to the radar intercept problem at microwave frequencies. The operational parameters of conventional components are then reviewed including the multiplexer; crystal video, instantaneous frequency measurement (IFM), and scanning superheterodyne receivers. The significance of modularity, digital control, and hybrid combinations of components is highlighted. A brief description follows of the operational Cutlass EW equipment. New components based on surface-acoustic waves (SAW) and acoustooptic (AO) Bragg cells are then presented and their particular importance in channelized receivers, IFMs, and microscan receivers noted. Finally, a number of conclusion5 are drawn covering likely trends in EW receivers and the need for continuing development of large-scale integrated (LSI) circuits for signal sorting and overall digital management.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1539310/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1981","publicationDate":"May 1981","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2005","volume":"28","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A review of current and future components for electronic warfare receivers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A review of current and future components for electronic warfare receivers","sourcePdf":"01539310.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087449S","chronDate":"May  1981","isNumber":"32849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10326","citationCount":"4","articleId":"1539310","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1539318,"authors":[{"name":"J.
