LEDs offer numerous advantages over lamp-based technology currently used. However, these advantages have not been harnessed because of limitations in creating a solar simulator with the highest rating (AAA) for spectral match, temporal stability, and light uniformity. Oriel's VeraSol is one of the first LED, triple A solar simulators. The VeraSol-LED was compared to the equally rated Oriel Sol3A-xenon lamp solar simulator by measuring the current-voltage (I-V) response and spectral response (SR) for a variety of solar cells. Both simulators effectively mimic the sun; however, the results demonstrate the LED-based simulator produced a more stable, flexible, and accurate match to AM1.5G than the xenon lamp-based simulator with similar marks in the quality of PV cell response.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7750227/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 June 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-10 June 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7750227/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2016","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16496528","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of xenon lamp-based and led-based solar simulators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of xenon lamp-based and led-based solar simulators","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"825.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053013S","chronDate":"5-10 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7701171","isNumber":"7749395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7701171","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7749395","articleId":"7750227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7750236,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammadreza Aghaei","affiliation":["Department of Energy, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Mohammadreza","lastName":"Aghaei","id":"37085388903"},{"name":"Sonia Leva","affiliation":["Department of Energy, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Sonia","lastName":"Leva","id":"37271993300"},{"name":"Francesco Grimaccia","affiliation":["Department of Energy, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Grimaccia","id":"37301034000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2724-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2725-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7750236","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":442},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power generation","Inspection","Feature extraction","Digital images","Photography","Detectors","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","image segmentation","infrared imaging","inspection","photography","photovoltaic power systems","power engineering computing","power generation planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PV power plant inspection","image mosaicing techniques","IR real-time images","PV power plant mapping","PV power plant planning","aerial thermovisual photography","light unmanned aerial system","UAS","thermograph camera onboard","digital image processing algorithm","infrared images","PV strings","DIP algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Operation and maintenance","Unmanned aerial system (UAS)","Image mosaicing (IM)","PV module","Digital image processing (DIP)","infrared (IR) image","PV power plant"]}],"abstract":"Operation and maintenance play a crucial role for the performance of PV power plants. In this experimental paper a novel approach is proposed included planning and mapping of PV power plants by digital image processing techniques. For this purpose, aerial thermovisual photography is carried out in a PV plant by a light Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) with a thermograph camera onboard. The main objective of current paper is to develop a digital image processing algorithm in order to provide an Image Mosaicing (IM) for richer description of the plant by merging many infrared (IR) images. The algorithm is able to analyze the image mosaicing (IM) in order to count total number of PV modules, defect and healthy modules in PV strings. The results have demonstrated that proposed digital image processing (DIP) algorithm is very efficient and reliable for analysis of infrared (IR) images to provide a depth perspective of PV power plants during procedure inspection.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PV power plant inspection by image mosaicing techniques for IR real-time images","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 43rd Photovoltaic Specialists Conference (PVSC)","doi":"10.1109/PVSC.2016.7750236","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 43rd Photovoltaic Specialists Conference (PVSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7701171/7749395/07750236.pdf","startPage":"3100","endPage":"3105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PVSC.2016.7750236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7749395","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7750236","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7750236/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 June 2016","displayDocTitle":"PV power plant inspection by image mosaicing techniques for IR real-time images","conferenceDate":"5-10 June 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7750236/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2016","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16483632","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PV power plant inspection by image mosaicing techniques for IR real-time images","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"834.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055238S","chronDate":"5-10 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7701171","isNumber":"7749395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7701171","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7749395","articleId":"7750236","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7750271,"authors":[{"name":"Zhan Wang","affiliation":["Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Zhan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085376420"},{"name":"Robert S.

Monitoring sub-system failures are common occurrences, reducing data availability in meteorological and electrical datasets. A reliable backfilling method can be applied in order to mitigate the impact of long monitoring gaps on system state and performance assessment. This paper introduces a method of inferring in-plane irradiation from remotely obtained global horizontal irradiation, by means of a neural network approach. Generation output is then calculated utilizing a simple electrical model with fitted coefficients. The proposed method is applied to a UK case study for which the mean absolute error in monthly system output was reduced significantly, to as low as 0.9%. This yielded more accurate results in backfilling the missing datasets when compared to standard approaches. The impact of missing data on monthly performance ratio is also investigated. Using backfilling to synthesize lost data increases performance ratio prediction accuracy significantly when compared to simply omitting such periods from the calculation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7750305/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 June 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-10 June 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7750305/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2016","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16483791","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Inference of missing PV monitoring data using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inference of missing PV monitoring data using neural networks","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"908.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08197S","chronDate":"5-10 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7701171","isNumber":"7749395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7701171","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7749395","articleId":"7750305","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7750553,"authors":[{"name":"Behnam Behroozpour","affiliation":["Bosch Research and Technology Center, Palo Alto, CA, USA","University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7811159/7750553/behro-2621755-small.gif","p":["Behnam Behroozpour (S\u201912\u2013M\u201916) received the B.Sc. degree from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2010, the M.Sc. degree from the University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands, in 2012, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, in 2016.","He is currently a Research Engineer with the Bosch Research and Technology Center, Palo Alto, CA, USA.

Optical circuitry, including input light couplers, waveguides, and photodiodes, is realized on a 3 mm \u00d7 3 mm silicon-photonic chip. The 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS ASIC of the same area comprises the frontend transimpedance amplifier, analog electro-optical PLL, and digital control circuitry consuming 1.7 mA from a 1.8 V supply and 14.1 mA from a 5-V supply. The latter includes 12.5-mA bias current for the distributed Bragg reflector section of the tunable laser. The two chips are integrated using through-silicon-vias implemented in the silicon-photonic chip.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2016.2621755","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/7811159/07750553.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2016.2621755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7811159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electronic-Photonic Integrated Circuit for 3D Microimaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Electronic-Photonic Integrated Circuit for 3D Microimaging","volume":"52","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16584874","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7750553/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7750553/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electronic-Photonic Integrated Circuit for 3D Microimaging","sourcePdf":"jssc-behroozpour-2621755-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07945S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"7811159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7811159","articleId":"7750553","onlineDate":"21 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7750555,"authors":[{"name":"Weicong Kong","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/8388565/7750555/kong-2631238-small.gif","p":["Weicong Kong (S\u201914) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from the South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2008 and 2011, respectively, and the M.Sc. degree from the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, U.K., in 2009.

This paper proposes a comprehensive and extensible framework to solve the load disaggregation problem for residential households. Our approach examines both the modelling of home appliances as hidden Markov models and the solving of non-intrusive load monitoring based on segmented integer quadratic constraint programming to disaggregate a household power profile into the appliance level. Structure of our approach to be implemented with current smart meter infrastructure is given and simulations are performed based on public datasets. All data are down-sampled to the rate that is consistent with the Australia smart meter infrastructure minimum functionality. The results demonstrate that our approach is able to work with existing smart meters to generate device level load model for other smart grid research and

a pure knowledge-based approach, using an appropriate set of abstract features obtained from the interpretation of the physiological processes underlying the signal. Methods: A set of qualitative morphological and rhythm features are obtained for each heartbeat as a result of the abductive interpretation of the ECG. Then, a QRS clustering algorithm is applied in order to reduce the effect of possible errors in the interpretation. Finally, a rule-based classifier assigns a tag to each cluster. Results: The method has been tested with the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database records, showing a significantly better performance than any other automatic approach in the state-of-the-art, and even improving most of the assisted approaches that require the intervention of an expert in the process. Conclusion: The most relevant issues in ECG classification, related to a large extent to the variability of the signal patterns between different subjects and even in the same subject over time, will be overcome by changing the reasoning paradigm. Significance: This paper demonstrates the power of an abductive framework for time-series interpretation to make a qualitative leap in the significance of the information extracted from the ECG by automatic methods.","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2016.2631247","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221020/8306527/07750556.pdf","startPage":"409","endPage":"420","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2016.2631247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8306527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heartbeat Classification Using Abstract Features From the Abductive Interpretation of the ECG","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7750556/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Heartbeat Classification Using Abstract Features From the Abductive Interpretation of the ECG","volume":"22","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2018","accessionNumber":"17600131","pubMedId":"27893401","publicationDate":"March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7750556/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness","grantNumber":"TIN2014-55183-R"},{"fundingName":"FPU"},{"fundingName":"Spanish Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"AP2010-1012"},{"fundingName":"Pedro Barri\u00e9 de la Maza Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heartbeat Classification Using Abstract Features From the Abductive Interpretation of the ECG","sourcePdf":"jbhi-teijeiro-2631247-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102158S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"8306527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8306527","articleId":"7750556","onlineDate":"21 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7750566,"authors":[{"name":"Lina Mroueh","affiliation":["Institut Sup\u00e9rieur d\u2019Electronique de Paris, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7855844/7750566/mroue-2631174-small.gif","p":["Lina Mroueh received the Engineering degree from Telecom ParisTech in 2006, the M.Sc. degree from the University of Pierre and Marie Curie in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree from Telecom ParisTech in 2010.

Unlike the radio-frequency space time coding design that deals with complex symbols holding phase and magnitude information, the phase detection in wireless optical communications remains very challenging. This restricts optical MIMO codes to carry positive magnitude information belonging to a finite range. To meet these requirements, we propose to design the FSO-MIMO codes considering first the whole real space R, followed by a bipolar to unipolar conversion to fit in the intensity margin. We consider the MIMO configurations with two or four transmitters (lasers). We base our shape-preserving construction on quadratic extension fields that linearly combine the real symbols to form a full diversity space time code with a symbol rate equal to two.

This paper presents a control technique that regulates this fluctuation to a constant value at all speeds with rated load torque. Transformerless configuration of this drive is as follows. An MMC is used as a front-end converter and is directly connected to the grid. It keeps the grid current sinusoidal and is in phase with the grid voltage. It generates regulated dc current at the output. Another MMC, connected in cascade with the earlier one, drives a three-phase induction motor. Therefore, the input to this rear-end MMC is constant dc current, the output is variable magnitude and frequency voltage source that drives the motor. This paper proposes a control strategy for this drive. The proposed control method and its performance have been analyzed and verified through experimental results in this paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7874245/07750569.pdf","startPage":"2742","endPage":"2749","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2016.2631118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2016.2631118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7874245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7750569","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of Medium-Voltage AC Motor Drive for Wide Speed Range Using Modular Multilevel Converter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["AC motors","Capacitors","DC motors","Fluctuations","Medium voltage","Voltage control","Torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC motor drives","induction motors","machine control","variable speed drives","voltage-source convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medium-voltage AC motor drive control","wide speed range","modular multilevel converter","variable speed drive","submodule capacitors","voltage fluctuations","rated load torque","transformerless configuration","front-end converter","sinusoidal grid current","grid voltage","three-phase induction motor","constant dc current","variable magnitude","frequency voltage source"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacitor voltage ripple","current source","medium-voltage drive","modular multilevel converter (MMC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7750569/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Control of Medium-Voltage AC Motor Drive for Wide Speed Range Using Modular Multilevel Converter","volume":"64","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7750569/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16723104","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of Medium-Voltage AC Motor Drive for Wide Speed Range Using Modular Multilevel Converter","sourcePdf":"tie-kumar-2631118-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067294S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7874245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7874245","articleId":"7750569","onlineDate":"21 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7750570,"authors":[{"name":"Athanasios G.

For the purposes of the analysis, the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC) has been employed with two alternative PMM configurations. Energy distribution over the NEDC for a small passenger's EV has been calculated and the equivalent multiple operating points have been extracted, using appropriate weights, in order to maintain an equal energy consumption basis, resulting in reduced computational cost. The proposed optimization technique is constituted of an adaptive differential evolution (DE) algorithm involving dynamic variation of the mutation factor, combined with finite-element (FE) and circuit models. The procedure is based on the precise calculation of the two axes input current components for each candidate solution and operating condition. The methodology introduced presents stable and fast convergence characteristics and has been applied to optimize the geometry of both surface-mounted and interior PMM configurations. The proposed motor is based on the thorough tradeoff among the two alternative optimized geometries and has been validated through measurements on a prototype.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Traction motors","Torque","Vehicles","Reluctance motors","Permanent magnet motors","Optimization","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","finite element analysis","permanent magnet motors","traction motor drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit model","FE model","finite-element model","mutation factor","DE algorithm","adaptive differential evolution algorithm","NEDC","New European Drive Cycle","PMM","permanent-magnet motors","electric vehicle drive cycle","fast adaptive evolutionary PM traction motor optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design optimization","differential evolution (DE)","drive cycle","electric vehicles (EVs)","field weakening (FW)","finite-element (FE) method","permanent-magnet motors (PMMs)","wide-speed-range operation"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7981437","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2016.2631161","startPage":"5762","endPage":"5774","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7981437/07750570.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2016.2631161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Adaptive Evolutionary PM Traction Motor Optimization Based on Electric Vehicle Drive Cycle","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fast Adaptive Evolutionary PM Traction Motor Optimization Based on Electric Vehicle Drive Cycle","accessionNumber":"17026912","publicationDate":"July 2017","volume":"66","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7750570/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7750570/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"\u0399\u039a\u03a5 Fellowships of Excellence for Postgraduate Studies in Greece\u2014Siemens Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Adaptive Evolutionary PM Traction Motor Optimization Based on Electric Vehicle Drive Cycle","sourcePdf":"tvt-sarigiannidis-2631161-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111739S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7981437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7981437","articleId":"7750570","onlineDate":"21 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7750571,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Yang","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Research Center for Motion Control of Ministry of Education, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/7866903/7750571/yang-2631239-small.gif","p":["Hui Yang (S\u201913) was born in Changning, China, in 1988.

The memorable flux is achieved due to the variable magnetization level of low coercive force (LCF) permanent magnets (PMs) Thus, the associated excitation loss is negligible, resulting in high efficiency operation over a wide speed range. A general hybrid PM magnetic circuit is modeled, which is characterized by spoke-array NdFeB PMs and LCF PMs sandwiched between an outer stator ring and an inner stator pole. Based on the magnetic circuit, the design conflicts within the stationary side are unveiled. Thereafter, the machine configuration is introduced, followed by a description of the design procedure. First, the optimal stator pole number is determined based on one-phase machine models. In addition, a simplified permeance function is utilized to analytically optimize the rotor number, accounting for different ratios of the slot opening to NdFeB PM thickness.

This is accompanied with background advances in wireless link bandwidth and rapid growth deployment of wireless network. As one of the main security threats MHWN faces, jamming attack has attracted much attention since it is easy to launch and can cause severe damages to the network. Accurate jammer localization plays an essential role in applying various anti-jamming countermeasures and it has been a hot topic in recent years. This survey overviews the major recent works done in the field of jammer localization for MHWN. The major contribution of this paper is to present all the typical jammer localization schemes in a single literature along with comprehensive performance comparison by simulation with respect to time complexity, location accuracy, and communication overhead in various MHWN deployment environments. Besides, directions for future research are outlined. We hope this survey can provide insight into different research directions to improve jammer localization accuracy for future developments.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2016.2631146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7936707","startPage":"765","endPage":"799","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/7936707/07750577.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Jammer Localization in Multi-Hop Wireless Network: A Comprehensive Survey","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7750577/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Secondquarter  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7750577/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Jammer Localization in Multi-Hop Wireless Network: A Comprehensive Survey","publicationDate":"Secondquarter 2017","accessionNumber":"16917910","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"2","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Major State Basic Research Development Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2012CB315806"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61402521 and 61201216"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Jiangsu Province Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"BK20140068 and BK20150201"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Jammer Localization in Multi-Hop Wireless Network: A Comprehensive Survey","sourcePdf":"comst-fan-2631146-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.223026S","chronDate":"Secondquarter  2017","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7936707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7936707","articleId":"7750577","onlineDate":"21 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7750587,"authors":[{"name":"\u00d6zg\u00fcr Bayer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Isik University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"\u00d6zg\u00fcr","lastName":"Bayer","id":"37086008293"},{"name":"Meng\u00fc\u00e7 \u00d6ner","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Isik University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Meng\u00fc\u00e7","lastName":"\u00d6ner","id":"37268389500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"7750587","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":620},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","MIMO","Timing","Channel estimation","Receivers","Transmitting antennas","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","interference (signal)","MIMO communication","modulation","space-time block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint space time block code and modulation classification","MIMO systems","multiple input multiple output systems","multi antenna transmission","signal identification systems","STBC","self-interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","signal identification","modulation type classification","space time block code classification"]}],"abstract":"Non-cooperative identification of unknown communication signals is a popular research area with widespread civilian and military applications. Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems employing multi-antenna transmission pose new challenges to signal identification systems, such as the classification of the employed space time block code (STBC) and modulation in the presence of the self-interference inherent to the multi-antenna transmission. In the existing literature, these two classification problems have been handled separately, despite the fact that they are interrelated. This letter presents a novel approach to MIMO signal identification by considering the modulation type and the STBC classification tasks as a joint classification problem.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Space Time Block Code and Modulation Classification for MIMO Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2016.2631167","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/7857815/07750587.pdf","startPage":"62","endPage":"65","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2016.2631167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7857815","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7750587","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7750587/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Joint Space Time Block Code and Modulation Classification for MIMO Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7750587/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16690221","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004410","fundingName":"TUBITAK","grantNumber":"112E020"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Space Time Block Code and Modulation Classification for MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"lwc-oner-2631167-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053104S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"7857815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7857815","articleId":"7750587","onlineDate":"21 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7750590,"authors":[{"name":"Rami Hamdi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada","\u00c9cole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7750590/hamdi-2630999-small.gif","p":["Rami Hamdi (S\u201916) received the Engineer Diploma degree from the Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure des Communications de Tunis, Ariana, Tunisia, in 2012, and the M.S. degree from the Ecole Nationale d\u2019Ing\u00e9nieurs de Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia, in 2014.

This consumption involves that activating all RF chains does not always necessarily achieve the maximum sum-rate when the total BS transmit power is limited. This paper formulates a sum-rate maximization problem when a low complexity linear precoder, such as conjugate beamforming or zero forcing beamforming, is used. The problem is first relaxed by assuming arbitrary antenna selection. In this case, we derive analytically the optimal number of activated RF chains that maximizes the sum-rate under either optimal power allocation or equal received power constraint for all users. Also, user scheduling algorithms are proposed when users require a minimum received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. Two iterative user scheduling algorithms are designed. The first one is efficient in terms of fairness and the second one achieves the optimal performance. Next, the antenna selection is investigated and we propose iterative antenna selection algorithms that are efficient in terms of instantaneous sum-rate. Simulation results corroborate our analytical results and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms compared with arbitrary and optimal brute force search antenna selection.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07750590.pdf","startPage":"8303","endPage":"8316","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2630999","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2630999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7750590","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation in Downlink Large-Scale MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antennas","MIMO","Radio frequency","Power demand","Resource management","Array signal processing","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","iterative methods","MIMO communication","precoding","resource allocation","telecommunication scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","downlink large-scale MIMO system","single-cell base station","large-scale antenna array system","transmit circuit","power consumption","RF chains","BS transmit power","sum-rate maximization","linear precoder","conjugate beamforming","zero forcing beamforming","optimal power allocation","power constraint","scheduling algorithms","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","iterative user scheduling algorithms","iterative antenna selection algorithms","instantaneous sum-rate","optimal brute force search antenna selection","arbitrary antenna selection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Large-scale MIMO","circuit power consumption","antenna selection","user scheduling","power allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7750590/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation in Downlink Large-Scale MIMO Systems","volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7750590/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16568336","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Resource Allocation in Downlink Large-Scale MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"access-hamdi-2630999-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.172014S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7419931","articleId":"7750590","onlineDate":"21 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7750592,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-Fang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China","School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/8272041/7750592/liu-2623803-small.gif","p":["Xiao-Fang Liu (S\u201914) received the B.S. degree in computer science from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2014, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","Her current research interests include artificial intelligence, evolutionary computation, swarm intelligence, and their applications in design and optimization such as cloud computing resources scheduling."]},"firstName":"Xiao-Fang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086127339"},{"name":"Zhi-Hui Zhan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/8272041/7750592/zhan-2623803-small.gif","p":["Zhi-Hui Zhan (S\u201909\u2013M\u201913) received the bachelor\u2019s and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2007 and 2013, respectively.","He is currently a Professor with the School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, where he is also appointed as the Pearl River Scholar Young Professor in 2016.

In this paper, evolutionary computing is applied to VMP to minimize the number of active physical servers, so as to schedule underutilized servers to save energy. Inspired by the promising performance of the ant colony system (ACS) algorithm for combinatorial problems, an ACS-based approach is developed to achieve the VMP goal. Coupled with order exchange and migration (OEM) local search techniques, the resultant algorithm is termed an OEMACS. It effectively minimizes the number of active servers used for the assignment of virtual machines (VMs) from a global optimization perspective through a novel strategy for pheromone deposition which guides the artificial ants toward promising solutions that group candidate VMs together. The OEMACS is applied to a variety of VMP problems with differing VM sizes in cloud environments of homogenous and heterogeneous servers. The results show that the OEMACS generally outperforms conventional heuristic and other evolutionary-based approaches, especially on VMP with bottleneck resource characteristics, and offers significant savings of energy and more efficient use of different resources.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7750592/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","volume":"22","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"17535518","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2018","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7750592/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Energy Efficient Ant Colony System for Virtual Machine Placement in Cloud Computing","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundations of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61402545"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundations of Guangdong Province for Distinguished Young Scholars","grantNumber":"2014A030306038"},{"fundingName":"Project for Pearl River New Star in Science and Technology","grantNumber":"201506010047"},{"fundingName":"GDUPS (2016)"},{"fundingName":"NSFC Key Program","grantNumber":"61332002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"An Energy Efficient Ant Colony System for Virtual Machine Placement in Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"tevc-zhan-2623803-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106548S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"8272041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"8272041","articleId":"7750592","onlineDate":"21 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7750594,"authors":[{"name":"Xiu Yin Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7803621/7750594/xzhan-2631218-small.gif","p":["Xiu Yin Zhang (S\u201907\u2013M\u201910\u2013SM\u201912) was born in Hubei, China.

The proposed element consists of two separate U-shaped patches operating at different frequencies and a multistub microstrip feed line. For size miniaturization, the smaller U-shaped patch is embedded in the larger one. In addition, the multistub feed line can generate two controllable resonant modes as well as two nulls in realized gain at the boresight direction. Since the modes of the patches and multistub feed line can be controlled individually, the two operating bands can be tuned to desired frequencies. Also, the radiation nulls in boresight gain can be controlled, high roll-off rate and out-of-band radiation rejection levels are thus obtained. For demonstration, a low profile (0.009\u03bb\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n) dual-band filtering antenna element operating at 1.9 and 2.6 GHz for TD-LTE applications (B39 and B38-bands) is implemented. Dual-band bandpass responses and four radiation nulls are observed in the experiment. Measured in-band gains are 6.7 and 7.3 dBi, whereas out-of-band gains are less than -10 dBi. Based on this element, a four-element MIMO antenna is further designed for LTE CPEs, where low profile and high integration of multiple components are required.

Accordingly, edge detection algorithms are introduced for automatic detection of fronts. However, traditional algorithms cannot be applied to cloud-contaminated images, because missing data caused by occasional cloud coverage interferes with front detection. To diminish this risk, this letter proposes a new algorithm for a quick and an accurate detection of fronts from an instant cloud-contaminated sea surface temperature (SST) image, instead of depending on the daily or weekly averaged SST images. This algorithm adopts a data-driven analog interpolation method, which estimates missing values from the historical data of the same region. After reducing the contour between the interpolated data and the original data, an instant front detection algorithm is proposed based on microcanonical multiscale formalism (MMF). The algorithm utilizes MMF to detect singularity exponents (SEs), and then enhances the features detected in a cloud-contaminated region. Finally, a threshold is set to extract fronts from SE. Experimental results on an AVHRR satellite SST image of 12:00 o'clock covering China Coastal waters confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2016.2618941","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/7778340/07750599.pdf","startPage":"1960","endPage":"1964","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2016.2618941","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7778340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ocean Front Detection From Instant Remote Sensing SST Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7750599","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7750599/","displayDocTitle":"Ocean Front Detection From Instant Remote Sensing SST Images","volume":"13","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16524368","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7750599/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41576011, 61401413 and 61601427"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007129","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province","grantNumber":"ZR2014FQ023 and ZR2015FQ011"},{"fundingName":"Opening Fund of State Key Laboratory of Applied Optics"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ocean Front Detection From Instant Remote Sensing SST Images","sourcePdf":"lgrs-yang-2618941-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084709S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"7778340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7778340","articleId":"7750599","onlineDate":"21 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7750607,"authors":[{"name":"Tan Tai Do","affiliation":["Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Tan Tai","lastName":"Do","orcid":"0000-0001-7421-0113","id":"37073918200"},{"name":"Hien Quoc Ngo","affiliation":["Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Hien Quoc","lastName":"Ngo","id":"38231185300"},{"name":"Trung Q.

This system consists of three layers, namely, a manufacturing device layer, cloud service system layer, and mobile service layer. The manufacturing device layer forms the production platform. This platform is composed of a number of physical devices, such as a flexible conveyor belt, industrial robots, and corresponding sensors. The physical devices are connected to the cloud via the support of a wireless module. In the cloud, the manufacturing big data are processed, and the optimization decision-making mechanism pertaining to customization manufacturing is formed. Then, mobile services running in a mobile terminal are used to receive orders from customers and to inquire the necessary production information.

Although, numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate and analyze DBMC systems, investigation on DBMC system through a multilayer channel has received less attention. The aims of this paper are to formulate channel characteristics and to evaluate the performance of multilayer DBMC channel in terms of delay spread and capacity. In this paper, the propagation of molecules over an n-layer channel is assumed to follow the Brownian motion and subjected to Fick's law of diffusion. Fourier transform is used to convert time to frequency domain functions. Besides, the multilayer channel is considered as a linear and deterministic channel. For the performance evaluation, the air-water-blood plasma medium representing the simplified multilayer diffusion model in the respiratory system was chosen. It was found that a high channel capacity can be achieved with wide transmission bandwidth, short transmission distance, and high averaged transmitted power. In addition, the findings showed that channel delay spread increases as both the transmission distance, and the pulse duration increased. By setting the symbol duration greater than the pulse duration or delay spread, an inter-symbol interference problem due to previous molecules transmission can be mitigated. These findings can be used as a guide in the development and fabrication of future artificial nanocommunication and nanonetworks systems involving multilayer transmission medium.","doi":"10.1109/TNB.2016.2631240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNB.2016.2631240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7792105","startPage":"599","endPage":"612","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","pdfPath":"/iel7/7728/7792105/07750634.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7750634","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonhomogeneous media","Delays","Channel capacity","Molecular communication","Medical services","Nanobioscience","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biodiffusion","blood","Brownian motion","molecular biophysics","nanomedicine"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacity-and-delay spread","multilayer diffusion-based molecular communication channel","nanoscale communication","molecule patterns","transmitter nanomachine","biomedical applications","healthcare applications","multilayer DBMC channel","n-layer channel","Fick's law-of-diffusion","Fourier transform","time-frequency domain functions","deterministic channel","air-water-blood plasma medium","simplified multilayer diffusion model","respiratory system","high-channel capacity","transmission bandwidth","transmission distance","averaged transmitted power","pulse duration","symbol duration","intersymbol interference","multilayer transmission medium","nanonetworks systems","molecules transmission","artificial nanocommunication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel capacity","delay spread","diffusion-based molecular communication (DBMC)","multilayer channel model","nanocommunication","square pulse transmission"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Biological Transport","Biomedical Engineering","Blood-Brain Barrier","Cell Communication","Cell Membrane","Computer Simulation","Diffusion","Humans","Information Theory","Models, Molecular","Nanotechnology"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Capacity and Delay Spread in Multilayer Diffusion-Based Molecular Communication (DBMC) Channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16561793","pubMedId":"27893397","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7750634/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7750634/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"UTM GUP Research","grantNumber":"Q.J1300000.2509.07H04"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003093","fundingName":"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007837","fundingName":"University Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM)"},{"fundingName":"Advanced Telecommunication Technology research group"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity and Delay Spread in Multilayer Diffusion-Based Molecular Communication (DBMC) Channel","sourcePdf":"tnb-mdmustam-2631240-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087927S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7728","isNumber":"7792105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7728","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7792105","articleId":"7750634","onlineDate":"21 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":7750640,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Yu Tsai","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, State College, PA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/7921657/7750640/tsai-2630683-small.gif","p":["Wei-Yu Tsai received the BS degree in electrical and control\n engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan, in 2009 and the MS degree in electrical engineering from\n National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan, in 2011.

However, traditional platforms for implementing these DNNs are often very power hungry, which has lead to significant efforts in the development of configurable platforms capable of implementing these DNNs efficiently. One of these platforms, the IBM TrueNorth processor, has demonstrated very low operating power in performing visual computing and neural network classification tasks in real-time. The neuron computation, synaptic memory, and communication fabrics are all configurable, so that a wide range of network types and topologies can be mapped to TrueNorth. This reconfigurability translates into the capability to support a wide range of low-power functions in addition to feed-forward DNN classifiers, including for example, the audio processing functions presented here.In this work, we propose an end-to-end audio processing pipeline that is implemented entirely on a TrueNorth processor and designed to specifically leverage the highly-parallel, low-precision computing primitives TrueNorth offers. As part of this pipeline, we develop an audio feature extractor (LATTE) designed for implementation on TrueNorth, and explore the tradeoffs among several design variants in terms of accuracy, power, and performance. We customize the energy-efficient deep neuromorphic networks structures that our design utilizes as the classifier and show how classifier parameters can trade between power and accuracy. In addition to enabling a wide range of diverse functions, the reconfigurability of TrueNorth enables re-training and re-programming the system to satisfy varying energy, speed, area, and accuracy requirements. The resulting system's end-to-end power consumption can be as low as 14:43 mW, which would give up to 100 hours of continuous usage with button cell batteries (CR3023 1:5 Whr) or 450 hours with cellphone batteries (iPhone 6s 6:55 Whr).","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/12/7921657/7750640-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7750640/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1 2017","volume":"66","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 May 2017","publicationDate":"1 June 2017","accessionNumber":"16880675","htmlLink":"/document/7750640/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Always-On Speech Recognition Using TrueNorth, a Reconfigurable, Neurosynaptic Processor","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"US National Science Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000143","fundingName":"CCF","grantNumber":"1317560"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004316","fundingName":"IBM"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Always-On Speech Recognition Using TrueNorth, a Reconfigurable, Neurosynaptic Processor","sourcePdf":"tc-tsai-2630683-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105793S","chronDate":"June 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7921657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7921657","articleId":"7750640","onlineDate":"21 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7750745,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The result indicates that the algorithm compromises on the occupied area and execution speed, so it's suitable for RFID device.","doi":"10.1109/RFID-TA.2016.7750747","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on RFID Technology and Applications (RFID-TA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on RFID Technology and Applications (RFID-TA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743710/7750726/07750747.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"43","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFID-TA.2016.7750747","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7750726","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7750747","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified research on RFID-oriented ECC point multiplication over GF(2<sup>m</sup>) field","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7750747/","displayDocTitle":"Modified research on RFID-oriented ECC point multiplication over GF(2<sup>m</sup>) field","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7750747/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16498968","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified research on RFID-oriented ECC point multiplication over GF(2<sup>m</sup>) field","confLoc":"Shunde, Foshan, China","sourcePdf":"1570282787.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064793S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743710","isNumber":"7750726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743710","xplore-issue":"7750726","articleId":"7750747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7750792,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Bocanegra","affiliation":["Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda de Sistemas y Computaci\u00f3n, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogota, D.C., Colombia"],"firstName":"Jos\u00e9","lastName":"Bocanegra","id":"37085696206"},{"name":"Jaime Pavlich-Mariscal","affiliation":["Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda de Sistemas y Computaci\u00f3n, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogota, D.C., Colombia"],"firstName":"Jaime","lastName":"Pavlich-Mariscal","id":"38275117400"},{"name":"Angela Carrillo-Ramos","affiliation":["Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda de Sistemas y Computaci\u00f3n, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogota, D.C., Colombia"],"firstName":"Angela","lastName":"Carrillo-Ramos","id":"38273023500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2966-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2965-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2967-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7750792","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"abstract":"An adaptive software has the ability of modify its own behavior due to changes in its surround context. Despite the importance of these kind of systems, the development of adaptive systems is a complex, error prone, and time consuming task. Several authors have defined a set of challenges to consider when software engineers develop adaptive systems. Although there are several approaches to address these challenges, we believe that a model-driven engineering (MDE) approach is the best suitable solution. The main goal of this paper is to argue that MDE can play a leading role in the development process of adaptive systems, since it can address most of the associated challenges. The paper includes a detailed analysis of the main dimensions in adaptation and thoroughly analyzes the potential of MDE to address each dimension. A final discussion is presented to demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of the MDE approach in this type of problems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software","Unified modeling language","Adaptation models","Adaptive systems","Runtime","DSL"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["formal specification","formal verification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model-driven engineering","adaptive systems","adaptive software","time consuming task","software engineers","MDE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptation","Adaptive Systems","Context","MDE"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ColumbianCC.2016.7750792","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 11th Colombian Computing Conference (CCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 11th Colombian Computing Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7738290/7750764/07750792.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7750764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ColumbianCC.2016.7750792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the role of model-driven engineering in adaptive systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7750792","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the role of model-driven engineering in adaptive systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7750792/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7750792/","accessionNumber":"16488825","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the role of model-driven engineering in adaptive systems","confLoc":"Popayan, Colombia","sourcePdf":"Fullpaper53.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110273S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7738290","isNumber":"7750764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7738290","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7750764","articleId":"7750792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7750816,"authors":[{"name":"Wilson Medina-Pazmi\u00f1o","affiliation":["CIDFAE, Research and Development Center of the Ecuadorian Air Force"],"firstName":"Wilson","lastName":"Medina-Pazmi\u00f1o","id":"37086208534"},{"name":"An\u00edbal Jara-Olmedo","affiliation":["Escuela Polit\u00e9cnica Nacional"],"firstName":"An\u00edbal","lastName":"Jara-Olmedo","id":"37086203013"},{"name":"David Valencia-Redrov\u00e1n","affiliation":["R&D Center, Ecuadorian Air Force, Ecuador"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Valencia-Redrov\u00e1n","id":"37086206277"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1629-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1630-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7750816","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":563},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Communication systems","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Aircraft","Propagation losses","Sensitivity","Monitoring","Aircraft navigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","command and control systems","data communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flight testing","carrier frequency","command and control station","UAV","unmanned aerial vehicles"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data link","UAS","UAV","Carrier Frequency","Command and Control Ground Station"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7750816","abstract":"In recent years, UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) they have shown enormous potential in civilian and military applications.

In an object-based NAND flash device, two causes of write amplification are onode partial update and cascading update. Updating one onode, a kind of small-sized object metadata, invokes partial page update (i.e., onode partial update) that incurs unnecessary migration of the un-updated data. An cascading update denotes that object metadata is updated in a cascading manner due to erase-before-program property of NAND flash memory. In this work, we propose a system design to alleviate onode partial update and cascading update. The proposed system design includes: 1) A multi-level garbage collection technique to minimize unnecessary data migration incurred by onode partial update; 2) A B+ table tree and selective cache design to reduce the write operations associated with cascading update; and 3) A power failure handling technique to guarantee system consistency. Experiment results show that our proposed design can achieve up to 20% write reduction compared to the best state-of-the-art.","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736514/7750953/07750962.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A design to reduce write amplification in object-based NAND flash devices","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7750953","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7750962","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7750962/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-7 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A design to reduce write amplification in object-based NAND flash devices","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16488608","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-7 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7750962/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A design to reduce write amplification in object-based NAND flash devices","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077376S","chronDate":"2-7 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736514","isNumber":"7750953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736514","xplore-issue":"7750953","articleId":"7750962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7750964,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Ming Chang","affiliation":["Macronix International Co., Ltd., Emerging System Lab., Hsinchu 300, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Yu-Ming","lastName":"Chang"},{"name":"Yung-Chun Li","affiliation":["Macronix International Co., Ltd., Emerging System Lab., Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Yung-Chun","lastName":"Li","id":"37085539069"},{"name":"Ping-Hsien Lin","affiliation":["Macronix International Co., Ltd., Emerging System Lab., Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Ping-Hsien","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085788499"},{"name":"Hsiang-Pang Li","affiliation":["Macronix International Co., Ltd., Emerging System Lab., Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Hsiang-Pang","lastName":"Li","id":"37072955000"},{"name":"Yuan-Hao Chang","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Yuan-Hao","lastName":"Chang","id":"37537830500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4483-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3590-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7750964","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":307},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programming","Threshold voltage","Error correction codes","Reliability engineering","Memory management","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories","integrated circuit reliability","performance evaluation","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["erase-free SLC flash memory","rewritable programming design","high-end applications","storage device performance","storage device reliability","single-level-cell flash memory","access latency","multilevel-cell flash memory","MLC flash memory","flash block","software management","rewritable usage model","SLC flash memory based storage system","6-time rewritable capability"]}],"abstract":"Over the past years, the adaptation of flash memory has seen a tremendous growth in a wide range of fields, with high-end applications demanding ever higher reliability and performance for storage devices. Even though a single-level-cell (SLC) flash memory can have a higher endurance and a lower access latency to better meet that requirement in comparison with a multi-level-cell (MLC) one, the rapid deterioration of reliability due to advanced shrinking technology means that a flash block can only survive over a smaller and smaller number of erase cycles. This work proposes an erase-free scheme, which comprises the design of rewritable programming and software management, to enable a rewritable usage model that can reuse flash blocks several times without using erase operations in an SLC flash memory based storage system. The evaluation results show that the proposed scheme achieves 6-time rewritable capability such that 83% erase operations can be removed; in the best settings, the write latency can be reduced by 3.67\u00d7 on average under various workloads.","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736514/7750953/07750964.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7750953","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7750964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Realizing erase-free SLC flash memory with rewritable programming design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-7 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7750964/","displayDocTitle":"Realizing erase-free SLC flash memory with rewritable programming design","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7750964/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"2-7 Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16488597","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Realizing erase-free SLC flash memory with rewritable programming design","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.265814S","chronDate":"2-7 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736514","isNumber":"7750953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736514","xplore-issue":"7750953","articleId":"7750964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7750968,"authors":[{"name":"Farzad Samie","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems (CES), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany"],"firstName":"Farzad","lastName":"Samie","id":"37888143500"},{"name":"Lars Bauer","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems (CES), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Bauer","id":"37411983400"},{"name":"J\u00f6rg Henkel","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems (CES), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00f6rg","lastName":"Henkel","id":"37277243700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4483-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3590-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7750968","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2238},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","Internet of Things"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IoT technologies","embedded computing","Internet-of-Things","embedded system design"]}],"abstract":"Emergence of Internet-of-Things brings a whole new class of applications and higher efficiency for existing services.

Current art in IoT architectures utilizes gateways to enable application-specific connectivity to IoT devices. In typical configurations, an IoT gateway is shared among several IoT devices. However, given the limited available bandwidth and processing capabilities of an IoT gateway, the quality of service (QoS) of IoT devices must be adjusted over time not only to fulfill the needs of individual IoT device users, but also to tolerate the QoS needs of the other IoT devices sharing the same gateway. In this paper, we address the problem of QoS management for IoT devices under bandwidth, battery, and processing constraints. We first formulate the problem of resource-aware QoS tailored to the IoT paradigm and then propose an efficient problem decomposition that enables the adoption of a recurrent dynamic programming approach with reduced execution time overhead. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed approach with a case study and through extensive experimentation over different IoT system configurations regarding to the number and type of the employed IoT-devices. Experiments show that our solution improves the overall QoS by 50% compared to an unsupervised system while both meet the constraints.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed QoS management for Internet of Things under resource constraints","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736514/7750953/07750969.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7750953","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7750969","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7750969/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-7 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Distributed QoS management for Internet of Things under resource constraints","conferenceDate":"2-7 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7750969/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497959","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed QoS management for Internet of Things under resource constraints","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097749S","chronDate":"2-7 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736514","isNumber":"7750953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736514","xplore-issue":"7750953","articleId":"7750969","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7750972,"authors":[{"name":"Junshi Wang","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China","TU Wien, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Junshi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085375059"},{"name":"Letian Huang","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Letian","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085382980"},{"name":"Qiang Li","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37085470637"},{"name":"Guangjun Li","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Guangjun","lastName":"Li","id":"37085525667"},{"name":"Axel Jantsch","affiliation":["TU Wien, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Axel","lastName":"Jantsch","id":"37282456900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4483-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3590-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7750972","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Circuit faults","Decoding","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","network-on-chip","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["location optimization","ECC protection","network-on-chip","NoC","error correcting codes","transient faults","single event upsets","SEU faults","SLOPE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Error Correcting Code","Single Event Upset","Protection Strategy","Network-on-Chip"]}],"abstract":"The communication in Network-on-Chips (NoCs) may be subject to errors. Error Correcting Codes (ECCs) can be used to tolerate the transient faults in flits caused by Single Event Upsets (SEU). ECC can improve the reliability of a NoC significantly at the cost of extra area and power consumption. However, ECC units (encoders and decoders) may also suffer from SEU faults and thus may lead to over-protection, meaning that providing more ECC units does not further improve reliability. This work analyzes reliability in NoCs, i.e. fractions of correctly received flits, considering the SEU errors introduced by both protected circuits and ECC units. The results show the potential for over-protection. Based on this analysis, we maximize the protection by optimizing the location of the ECC units. We study the reliability of an 8 \u00d7 8 Mesh NoC with six ECC protection strategies, and we conclude that one protection strategy called SLOPE achieves the best trade-off among the six examined strategies by considering reliability, latency, area, energy consumption and design space comprehensively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing the location of ECC protection in Network-on-Chip","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7750953","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736514/7750953/07750972.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7750972","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7750972/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-7 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing the location of ECC protection in Network-on-Chip","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7750972/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497955","conferenceDate":"2-7 Oct. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing the location of ECC protection in Network-on-Chip","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091211S","chronDate":"2-7 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736514","isNumber":"7750953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736514","xplore-issue":"7750953","articleId":"7750972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7750973,"authors":[{"name":"Hung-Sheng Chang","affiliation":["Macronix International Co., Ltd., Emerging System Lab., Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C.","Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Hung-Sheng","lastName":"Chang","id":"37085672906"},{"name":"Yuan-Hao Chang","affiliation":["lnstitute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Yuan-Hao","lastName":"Chang","id":"37537830500"},{"name":"Tei-Wei Kuo","affiliation":["Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Tei-Wei","lastName":"Kuo","id":"37085730830"},{"name":"Yu-Ming Chang","affiliation":["Macronix International Co., Ltd., Emerging System Lab., Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Yu-Ming","lastName":"Chang","id":"37085405493"},{"name":"Hsiang-Pang Li","affiliation":["Macronix International Co., Ltd., Emerging System Lab., Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Hsiang-Pang","lastName":"Li","id":"37072955000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4483-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3590-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7750973","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":355},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A disturbance-aware sub-block design to improve reliability of 3D MLC flash memory","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736514/7750953/07750973.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7750953","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Reliability engineering","Resistance","Programming","Logic gates","Error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories","integrated circuit design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["disturbance-aware subblock design","3D MLC flash memory","flash-memory chips","vertical storage cell stacking","2D chips","resistance patterns","hardware cost","MTD layer","hotness information","flash translation layer","SNIA","DFTL","BL","page-level FTL","block-level FTL design","MLC programming designs"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7750973","abstract":"The reliability problem of modern flash-memory chips quickly deteriorates because of the nature of MLC chips.

In particular, a disturbance-aware sub-block design is proposed to utilize the hotness information of data to further improve the reliability of 3D MLC flash memory by smartly choosing sub-blocks to use when extra information is available from the flash translation layer. The proposed design was evaluated by a series of experiments over traces from SNIA.

However, energy harvesting powered embedded systems suffer from frequent execution interruption due to unstable energy supply. To bridge intermittent program execution across different power cycles, non-volatile processor (NVP) was proposed to checkpoint register contents during power failure. Together with register contents, the cache contents also need to be preserved during power failure. While pure non-volatile memory (NVM) based cache is an intuitive option, it suffers from inferior performance due to high write latency and energy overhead. In this paper, we will propose replacement and checkpoint policies for SRAM and NVM based hybrid cache in NVPs whose execution is interrupted frequently. Checkpointing aware cache replacement polices and smart checkpointing polices are proposed to achieve satisfactory performance and efficient checkpointing upon a power failure and fast resumption when power returns. The experimental results show that the proposed architectures and polices outperform existing cache architectures for NVPs.","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736514/7750953/07750977.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7750953","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Checkpoint aware hybrid cache architecture for NV processor in energy harvesting powered systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7750977","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Checkpoint aware hybrid cache architecture for NV processor in energy harvesting powered systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-7 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7750977/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-7 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16488588","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7750977/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Checkpoint aware hybrid cache architecture for NV processor in energy harvesting powered systems","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095203S","chronDate":"2-7 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736514","isNumber":"7750953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736514","xplore-issue":"7750953","articleId":"7750977","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7750979,"authors":[{"name":"Ishan G Thakkar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Ishan G","lastName":"Thakkar","id":"37085375333"},{"name":"Sai Vineel Reddy Chittamuru","affiliation":["Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, US"],"firstName":"Sai Vineel Reddy","lastName":"Chittamuru"},{"name":"Sudeep Pasricha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Sudeep","lastName":"Pasricha","id":"37265205600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4483-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3590-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7750979","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Crosstalk","Photonics","Optical waveguides","Signal to noise ratio","Reliability","Optical filters","Wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit noise","integrated circuit reliability","integrated optics","optical crosstalk","optical modulation","optical resonators","optical waveguides","system-on-chip","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["silicon photonic NoC architectures","tunable decoupling","photonic network-on-chip architectures","photonic waveguides","dense-wavelength-division-multiplexing","signal traversal","microring resonators","signal modulation","bandwidth on-chip transfers","time-dependent unfilterable homodyne crosstalk noise","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","on-chip communication reliability","DWDM-based PNoCs","Corona","Firefly","Flexishare","energy overhead","photonic area overhead"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Photonic network on chip","crosstalk noise","reliability"]}],"abstract":"Photonic network-on-chip (PNoC) architectures employ photonic waveguides with dense-wavelength-division-multiplexing (DWDM) for signal traversal and microring resonators (MRs) for signal modulation, to enable high bandwidth on-chip transfers. Unfortunately, due to the resonant nature of MRs, the power built-up in their cavity gradually recouples back into the photonic waveguides. This recoupled power induces time-dependent unfilterable homodyne crosstalk noise, when the wavelength of the recoupled power matches with the wavelength of a signal in the waveguide. The homodyne crosstalk in turn deteriorates the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and on-chip communication reliability. This paper presents a novel lightweight technique to mitigate homodyne crosstalk noise in DWDM-based PNoCs. We evaluate the effectiveness and overhead of our technique by implementing it for well-known PNoC architectures, including Corona, Firefly and Flexishare. Experimental results indicate that our approach when implemented on these PNoCs can improve the worst-case SNR by up to 37.6% compared to the baseline versions of these PNoCs, thereby significantly enhancing reliability, at the cost of up to 19.2% energy overhead and 1.7% photonic area overhead.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigation of homodyne crosstalk noise in silicon photonic NoC architectures with tunable decoupling","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736514/7750953/07750979.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7750953","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7750979","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7750979/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-7 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Mitigation of homodyne crosstalk noise in silicon photonic NoC architectures with tunable decoupling","conferenceDate":"2-7 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7750979/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16488602","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigation of homodyne crosstalk noise in silicon photonic NoC architectures with tunable decoupling","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105529S","chronDate":"2-7 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736514","isNumber":"7750953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736514","xplore-issue":"7750953","articleId":"7750979","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7750981,"authors":[{"name":"Hyunsun Park","affiliation":["Department of EE, POSTECH"],"firstName":"Hyunsun","lastName":"Park","id":"37960670900"},{"name":"Dongyoung Kim","affiliation":["Department of CSE, Seoul National University"],"firstName":"Dongyoung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085699592"},{"name":"Junwhan Ahn","affiliation":["Department of EE, Seoul National University"],"firstName":"Junwhan","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37855457600"},{"name":"Sungjoo Yoo","affiliation":["Department of CSE, Seoul National University"],"firstName":"Sungjoo","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37085210700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4483-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3590-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7750981","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":843},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Graphics processing units","Hardware","Neural networks","Kernel","Convolutional codes","Memory management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","convolution","graphics processing units","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPU","total execution time","deep convolutional neural networks","Winograd convolution","hardware mechanism","data reuse optimization","on-chip cache accesses","deep CNN","VGG-16","GPGPU-Sim","Titan X","ZeroSkip","AddOpt","zero data reuse-aware fast convolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional neural networks","zero data","data reuse"]}],"abstract":"Convolution operations dominate the total execution time of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this paper, we aim at enhancing the performance of the state-of-the-art convolution algorithm (called Winograd convolution) on the GPU. Our work is based on two observations: (1) CNNs often have abundant zero weights and (2) the performance benefit of Winograd convolution is limited mainly due to extra additions incurred during data transformation. In order to exploit abundant zero weights, we propose a low-overhead and efficient hardware mechanism that skips multiplications that will always give zero results regardless of input data (called ZeroSkip). In addition, to leverage the second observation, we present data reuse optimization for addition operations in Winograd convolution (called AddOpt), which improves the utilization of local registers, thereby reducing on-chip cache accesses. Our experiments with a real-world deep CNN, VGG-16, on GPGPU-Sim and Titan X show that the proposed methods, ZeroSkip and AddOpt, achieve 51.8% higher convolution performance than the baseline Winograd convolution. Moreover, even without any hardware modification, AddOpt alone gives 35.6% higher performance on a real hardware platform, Titan X.","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736514/7750953/07750981.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7750953","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7750981","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zero and data reuse-aware fast convolution for deep neural networks on GPU","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-7 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7750981/","displayDocTitle":"Zero and data reuse-aware fast convolution for deep neural networks on GPU","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7750981/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"2-7 Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16488604","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero and data reuse-aware fast convolution for deep neural networks on GPU","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108266S","chronDate":"2-7 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736514","isNumber":"7750953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736514","xplore-issue":"7750953","articleId":"7750981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7750982,"authors":[{"name":"Hokchhay Tann","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Brown University Providence, RI"],"firstName":"Hokchhay","lastName":"Tann","id":"37086070348"},{"name":"Soheil Hashemi","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Brown University Providence, RI"],"firstName":"Soheil","lastName":"Hashemi","id":"37085706200"},{"name":"R.

Our configuration technique adjusts the number of channels in the network dynamically depending on response time, power, and accuracy targets. To enable this dynamic configuration technique, we co-design a new training algorithm, where the network is incrementally trained such that the weights in channels trained in earlier steps are fixed. Our technique provides the flexibility of multiple networks while storing and utilizing one set of weights. We evaluate our techniques using both an ASIC-based hardware accelerator as well as a low-power embedded GPGPU and show that our approach leads to only a small or negligible loss in the final network accuracy. We analyze the performance of our proposed methodology using three well-known networks for MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN datasets, and we show that we are able to achieve up to 95% energy reduction with less than 1% accuracy loss across the three benchmarks. In addition, compared to prior work on dynamic network reconfiguration, we show that our approach leads to approximately 50% savings in storage requirements, while achieving similar accuracy.","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736514/7750953/07750982.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7750953","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7750982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Runtime configurable deep neural networks for energy-accuracy trade-off","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-7 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7750982/","displayDocTitle":"Runtime configurable deep neural networks for energy-accuracy trade-off","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7750982/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"2-7 Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497950","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Runtime configurable deep neural networks for energy-accuracy trade-off","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086428S","chronDate":"2-7 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736514","isNumber":"7750953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736514","xplore-issue":"7750953","articleId":"7750982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7750987,"authors":[{"name":"Bita Darvish Rouhani","affiliation":["UC, San Diego"],"firstName":"Bita Darvish","lastName":"Rouhani","id":"37085454164"},{"name":"Azalia Mirhoseini","affiliation":["Google"],"firstName":"Azalia","lastName":"Mirhoseini","id":"37541508300"},{"name":"Farinaz Koushanfar","affiliation":["UC, San Diego"],"firstName":"Farinaz","lastName":"Koushanfar","id":"37284705800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4483-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3590-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7750987","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":259},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7750987","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Machine learning","Computational modeling","Runtime","Neurons","Data models","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","Big Data","computational complexity","data analysis","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep learning","massive data analytics","physical constraints","deep neural networks","computationally complex learning mechanisms","artificial intelligence","physical viability","energy efficiency","DeLight","DNN architectures","platform characteristics","automated customization methodology","DNN configurations","resource-aware data transformation","content-aware data transformation","lower-dimensional embedding","API","rapid prototyping","smart-sensing applications"]}],"abstract":"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are a set of powerful yet computationally complex learning mechanisms that are projected to dominate various artificial intelligence and massive data analytic domains. Physical viability, such as timing, memory, or energy efficiency, are standing challenges in realizing the true potential of DNNs. We propose DeLight, a set of novel methodologies which aim to bring physical constraints as design parameters in the training and execution of DNN architectures. We use physical profiling to bound the network size in accordance to the pertinent platform's characteristics. An automated customization methodology is proposed to adaptively conform the DNN configurations to meet the characterization of the underlying hardware while minimally affecting the inference accuracy. The key to our approach is a new content- and resource-aware transformation of data to a lower-dimensional embedding by which learning the correlation between data samples requires significantly smaller number of neurons. We leverage the performance gain achieved as a result of the data transformation to enable the training of multiple DNN architectures that can be aggregated to further boost the inference accuracy. An accompanying API is also developed, which can be used for rapid prototyping of an arbitrary DNN application customized to the platform. Proof-of concept evaluations for deployment of different imaging, audio, and smart-sensing applications demonstrate up to 100-fold performance improvement compared to the state-of-the-art DNN solutions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7750953","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736514/7750953/07750987.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Going deeper than deep learning for massive data analytics under physical constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-7 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Going deeper than deep learning for massive data analytics under physical constraints","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-7 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7750987/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16488592","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7750987/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Going deeper than deep learning for massive data analytics under physical constraints","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"CO2SS4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045861S","chronDate":"2-7 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736514","isNumber":"7750953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736514","xplore-issue":"7750953","articleId":"7750987","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7751006,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriele Formicone","affiliation":["Integra Technologies, Inc., El Segundo, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Gabriele","lastName":"Formicone","id":"37079030500"},{"name":"Jeff Burger","affiliation":["Integra Technologies, Inc., El Segundo, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jeff","lastName":"Burger","id":"38238234900"},{"name":"James Custer","affiliation":["Integra Technologies, Inc., El Segundo, CA, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Custer","id":"37085522908"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1608-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1609-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8443"}],"articleNumber":"7751006","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":351},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Gallium nitride","Power generation","Power amplifiers","Transistors","Impedance","Iron"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer layers","ceramic packaging","field effect analogue integrated circuits","gallium compounds","HEMT integrated circuits","III-V semiconductors","radar transmitters","semiconductor doping","UHF integrated circuits","UHF power amplifiers","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UHF radar amplifier","UHF frequency band","GaN HEMT device","power conversion application","pulsed RF power amplifier","duty cycle","RF GaN technology","RF GaN transistor","peak iron doping","buffer layer","gate periphery","ceramic package","drain efficiency","radar transmitter receive mode","voltage 150 V","power 1 kW","frequency 420 MHz to 450 MHz","voltage 50 V","size 15 mm","voltage 600 V"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7751006","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"150 V-Bias RF GaN for 1 kW UHF Radar Amplifiers","doi":"10.1109/CSICS.2016.7751006","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuit Symposium (CSICS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuit Symposium (CSICS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750393/7750996/07751006.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7750996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSICS.2016.7751006","abstract":"A 1 kilowatt pulsed RF amplifier operating at 150 V for radar applications in the UHF frequency band from 420 MHz to 450 MHz is presented.

The CD-Cascode DA MMIC is based on a 0.15\u03bcm GaN-HEMT wafer process technology. By exploiting the common-drain-Cascode as a transconductance device cell, an improvement in IP3 of 9 dB at mid-band (20GHz) and > 3 dB from 30-44 GHz were achieved as compared to a conventional Cascode DA implementation without sacrificing gain-bandwidth. The resulting amplifier achieves IP3's of 45.2, 34.5, and 33.5 dBm at 20, 40, and 44 GHz, respectively. To the author's knowledge this is believed to be the highest IP3 reported for a GaN DA at these frequencies. The amplifier obtains a nominal gain of 17 dB and maintains greater than 10 dB of gain up to 45 GHz with good input and output return-loss.

A TIA of such form may become indispensable as the size, complexity and cost of receivers continue to reduce. The design has been realized in a 130nm SiGe BiCMOS process for a low cost, high performance solution towards long- haul/metro applications. The TIA is capable of providing control functions either digitally through an on-chip 4-wire serial-peripheral interface (SPI) or in analog mode. Analog mode is provided as an alternative control for real-time control and monitoring. To provide high input dynamic range, a variable gain control block is integrated for each channel, which can be used in automatic or manual mode. The TIA has a differential input, differential output configuration that exhibits state-of-the-art THD of <;0.9% up to 500mVpp output voltage swing for input currents up to 2mApp and high isolation > 40dB between adjacent channels. A high transimpedance gain (Zt) up to ~7K\u03a9 with a large dynamic range up to 37dB and variable bandwidth up to 34GHz together with low average input noise density of 20pA/\u221aHz has been achieved. To the authors' knowledge, these metrics combined with diverse functionality and high integration have not been exhibited so far. This paper intends to report a state-of-the-art high-baud rate TIA and provide insight into possibilities for further integration.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuit Symposium (CSICS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750393/7750996/07751043.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuit Symposium (CSICS)","doi":"10.1109/CSICS.2016.7751043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSICS.2016.7751043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7750996","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7751043","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Highly-Integrated Quad-Channel Transimpedance Amplifier for Next Generation Coherent Optical Receiver","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage measurement","Current measurement","Bandwidth","Monitoring","Gain control","Optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS integrated circuits","Ge-Si alloys","integrated optoelectronics","operational amplifiers","optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["highly integrated transimpedance amplifier","quad channel transimpedance amplifier","next generation coherent optical receiver","RFIC","100G miniaturized coherent receiver","400G miniaturized coherent receiver","BiCMOS process","serial-peripheral interface","variable gain control","wavelength 130 nm","SiGe"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7751043/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Highly-Integrated Quad-Channel Transimpedance Amplifier for Next Generation Coherent Optical Receiver","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7751043/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16499267","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly-Integrated Quad-Channel Transimpedance Amplifier for Next Generation Coherent Optical Receiver","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"pid1180912.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048128S","chronDate":"23-26 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750393","isNumber":"7750996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750393","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7750996","articleId":"7751043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7751045,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Dense deployment of femtocells imposes several challenges for a cluster-based resource allocation. Some of those challenges are the trade-off between the level of offloaded traffic from macrocell and bandwidth allocated to femto-tier, the fair distribution of resources, and the mitigation of inter-cluster interference. To overcome these limitations, we propose a coalitional game to form clusters of femtocells that can reduce the resource allocation complexity. Stable clusters are formed based on the core model. Our proposal mainly consists of three components. Namely, a femtocell selection for public users, a coalitional game where cooperative femtocells are rewarded, and a Weighted Water Filling algorithm to allocate resources. Our solution is performed under a rewarding model, which is based on an ideal spectral efficiency and on an effective spectral efficiency. We compare the results of our rewarding model with a non-cooperative model, where femtocells work in closed access mode. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposal improves the femto-tier throughput and the satisfaction of femtocells subscribers.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 17th International Telecommunications Network Strategy and Planning Symposium (Networks)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742073/7751140/07751179.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"226","publicationTitle":"2016 17th International Telecommunications Network Strategy and Planning Symposium (Networks)","doi":"10.1109/NETWKS.2016.7751179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NETWKS.2016.7751179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7751140","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7751179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A coalitional game for femtocell clustering in OFDMA macro-femtocell networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Games","Ultrafast electronics","Macrocell networks","Bandwidth","Interference","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","frequency division multiple access","game theory","interference suppression","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coalitional game","femtocell clustering","OFDMA macrofemtocell networks","resource management","macrofemtocell networks","cluster-based resource allocation","offloaded traffic","inter-cluster interference mitigation","resource allocation","cooperative femtocells","weighted water filling algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7751179/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A coalitional game for femtocell clustering in OFDMA macro-femtocell networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7751179/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16498494","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A coalitional game for femtocell clustering in OFDMA macro-femtocell networks","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"36.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074749S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7742073","isNumber":"7751140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7742073","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7751140","articleId":"7751179","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7751190,"authors":[{"name":"Lizeth Lopez-Lopez","affiliation":["Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de San Luis Potos\u00ed, San Luis Potos\u00ed, M\u00e9xico"],"firstName":"Lizeth","lastName":"Lopez-Lopez","id":"37086204747"},{"name":"Marco Cardenas-Juarez","affiliation":["Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de San Luis Potos\u00ed, San Luis Potos\u00ed, M\u00e9xico"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Cardenas-Juarez","id":"38270918300"},{"name":"Enrique Stevens-Navarro","affiliation":["Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de San Luis Potos\u00ed, San Luis Potos\u00ed, M\u00e9xico"],"firstName":"Enrique","lastName":"Stevens-Navarro","id":"38273073800"},{"name":"Ulises Pineda-Rico","affiliation":["Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de San Luis Potos\u00ed, San Luis Potos\u00ed, M\u00e9xico"],"firstName":"Ulises","lastName":"Pineda-Rico","id":"38277735600"},{"name":"Aldo G.

These signals might exhibit very low-power at cognitive (or secondary) users' receivers. Thus requiring detection algorithms that work well in the very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region. It is known that secondary users (SUs) can improve its detection performance if some known information about PUs' signals is available. In this regard, some PUs can use superimposed training (ST) technique for channel estimation and synchronization purposes in their own networks. However, to the authors knowledge, the exploitation of this ST information by SUs in the context of cognitive radio has not been studied yet. In this paper, a new spectrum sensing algorithm for superimposed trained PUs' signals is designed based on the Neyman-Pearson criterion. The proposed algorithm takes advantage of the ST sequence to improve the detection performance of SUs. Results show that, even with a small training-to-information power ratio, the superimposed training-based detector (STD) significantly outperforms the energy detector; specifically in the very low SNR, which is of interest in cognitive radio. Moreover, if ST is not used, the proposed STD reduces to the energy detector.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEE.2016.7751190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7751183","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 13th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control (CCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742113/7751183/07751190.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Superimposed training-based detector for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7751190/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7751190/","displayDocTitle":"Superimposed training-based detector for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio","conferenceDate":"26-30 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16498521","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Superimposed training-based detector for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio","confLoc":"Mexico City, Mexico","sourcePdf":"CCE_2016_paper_8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059317S","chronDate":"26-30 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7742113","isNumber":"7751183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7742113","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7751183","articleId":"7751190","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7751200,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Morales-P\u00e9rez","affiliation":["Electronics Department National Institute for Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics Puebla, Mexico"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Morales-P\u00e9rez","id":"37085995373"},{"name":"Jose Rangel-Magdaleno","affiliation":["Electronics Department National Institute for Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics Puebla, Mexico"],"firstName":"Jose","lastName":"Rangel-Magdaleno","id":"38331783100"},{"name":"Israel Cruz-Vega","affiliation":["Electronics Department National Institute for Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics Puebla, Mexico"],"firstName":"Israel","lastName":"Cruz-Vega","id":"37085834345"},{"name":"Juan Ramirez-Cortes","affiliation":["Electronics Department National Institute for Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics Puebla, Mexico"],"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Ramirez-Cortes","id":"38276166700"},{"name":"Hayde Peregrina-Barreto","affiliation":["Computer Science Department National Institute for Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics Puebla, Mexico"],"firstName":"Hayde","lastName":"Peregrina-Barreto","id":"38307754000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3511-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3510-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3512-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7751200","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":419},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7751200","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matching pursuit algorithms","Field programmable gate arrays","Dictionaries","MATLAB","Algorithm design and analysis","Random access memory","Electrical engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","iterative methods","signal classification","signal reconstruction","signal representation","singular value decomposition","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm","OMP algorithm","field programmable gate array","k-singular value decomposition algorithm","K-SDV algorithm","Matlab","signal reconstruction","sparse representation","signal classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","OMP","Sparse representation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm is implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) to obtain the number and position of the atoms in a dictionary.

This design requires a larger circuit complexity compared to the first design, but performance is substantially improved; moreover, all cells of a memory array can be simultaneously restored, thus suitable for restarting with power-on. A comparison of these designs with a previous scheme is also pursued; it is shown that the proposed designs improve performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7751328/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Aug. 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7751328/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16498631","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"22-25 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Designs of PMC-based non-volatile memory circuits for data restoring","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designs of PMC-based non-volatile memory circuits for data restoring","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"0051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038853S","chronDate":"22-25 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7742133","isNumber":"7751285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7742133","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7751285","articleId":"7751328","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7751385,"authors":[{"name":"Manan Suri","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology - Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Manan","lastName":"Suri","id":"37902980300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1493-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1494-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7751385","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":259},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Nanoscale devices","Hardware","Training","Computer architecture","Switches","Resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nanoelectronics","resistive RAM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RRAM nanodevices","nonVon Neumann computing paradigms","nonvolatile nanoscale resistive memory technology","nanoscale hardware","nonspike based machine learning driven architectures","ML driven architectures","extreme learning machines","ELMs","restricted Boltzmann machines","RBMs"]}],"abstract":"This paper attempts to discuss a selective overview of some recent trends & concepts in the field of unconventional (non-Von Neumann) computing paradigms using emerging non-volatile nanoscale resistive memory technology (RRAM).

A nanodevice that executes this calculation is also presented. The calculation circuit is useful for extremely low power operation. This operation uses the rising slopes of post-synaptic potentials triggered by input spike pulses. In the time-domain calculation circuit, the energy dissipation is independent of the resistance, and only depends on the capacitance and voltages. However, the time constant, which is the product of the resistance and capacitance, should be relatively large to guarantee the calculation resolution, and therefore the resistance should be at the giga-ohms levels. The nanodevice consists of a nanodisk array connected with a fin field-effect transistor. Nanodisk arrays can be fabricated using a self-assembly bio-nano-template technique, and they act as resistors with resistance levels of several giga-ohms. A weighted sum can be achieved with an energy dissipation on the order of 1 fJ, with a number of inputs that can be more than 100. This amount of energy is several orders of magnitude lower than that of conventional digital processors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spike-based time-domain weighted-sum calculation using nanodevices for low power operation","doi":"10.1109/NANO.2016.7751490","endPage":"392","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE-NANO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742133/7751285/07751490.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE-NANO)","startPage":"390","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANO.2016.7751490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7751285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7751490","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Time-domain analysis","Very large scale integration","Biological neural networks","Nanoscale devices","Timing","Resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit modelling","low-power electronics","MOSFET","nanoelectronics","neural chips","self-assembly","time-domain analysis","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spike-based time-domain weighted-sum calculation","nanodevice","low power operation","spiking neuron model","resistance-capacitance circuit","CMOS VLSI technology","post-synaptic potentials","spike pulses","time-domain calculation circuit","energy dissipation","time constant","nanodisk array","fin field-effect transistor","self-assembly bionanotemplate technique","digital processors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spike-based time-domain weighted-sum calculation using nanodevices for low power operation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7751490/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Aug. 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7751490/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","conferenceDate":"22-25 Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16498657","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spike-based time-domain weighted-sum calculation using nanodevices for low power operation","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"0267.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062096S","chronDate":"22-25 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7742133","isNumber":"7751285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7742133","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7751285","articleId":"7751490","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7751533,"authors":[{"name":"Bo-Hao Chen","affiliation":["Dept. of EE, CCU, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Bo-Hao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086199485"},{"name":"Pei-Yuan Chou","affiliation":["Dept. of EE, CCU, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pei-Yuan","lastName":"Chou","id":"37085385637"},{"name":"Ya-Bei Fang","affiliation":["Dept. of EE, CCU, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ya-Bei","lastName":"Fang","id":"37086210654"},{"name":"Lee-Kee Yong","affiliation":["MediaTek, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Lee-Kee","lastName":"Yong"},{"name":"Tay-Jyi Lin","affiliation":["Dept. of EE, CCU, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tay-Jyi","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085866074"},{"name":"Jinn-Shyan Wang","affiliation":["Dept. of EE, CCU, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jinn-Shyan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085448233"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1493-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1494-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7751533","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":437},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7751533","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","CMOS logic circuits","integrated circuit design","logic design","nanoelectronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultra-low-leakage near-threshold dynamic circuit design","nanoCMOS circuit","IoT applications","lowly duty-cycled applications","PVT variations","near-Vt dynamic circuits","ripple carry adder","leakage power consumptions","duty cycle","dynamic RCA","energy reduction","size 28 nm","word length 32 bit"]}],"abstract":"IoT edge devices demand ultra-low leakage for lowly duty-cycled applications. It is usually believed that the static near-threshold-voltage (near-Vt) CMOS circuit is the only circuit style that is suitable for designing devices to achieve low power, low leakage, medium performance, and high robustness against PVT variations. In this work, we show that the dynamic circuit can be even better than the static circuit under the same performance requirement. First, through a design example, we obtain basic design guidelines for near-Vt dynamic circuits. Second, based on the obtained design guidelines, we demonstrate how to design a dynamic circuit with active and standby operation modes using a 32b ripple carry adder (RCA). All designs are based on 28 nm CMOS technology. We also compare the active and leakage power consumptions of both types of circuits of the same performance. For an IoT application with a 0.02% duty cycle, the 32b dynamic RCA achieves a 35% energy reduction compared to the static counterpart.","doi":"10.1109/NANO.2016.7751533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANO.2016.7751533","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE-NANO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE-NANO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742133/7751285/07751533.pdf","startPage":"537","endPage":"540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7751285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of ultra-low-leakage near-threshold dynamic circuits in nano CMOS for IoT applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7751533/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Aug. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design of ultra-low-leakage near-threshold dynamic circuits in nano CMOS for IoT applications","conferenceDate":"22-25 Aug. 2016","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16498590","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7751533/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of ultra-low-leakage near-threshold dynamic circuits in nano CMOS for IoT applications","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"0329.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057724S","chronDate":"22-25 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7742133","isNumber":"7751285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7742133","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7751285","articleId":"7751533","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7751581,"authors":[{"name":"Chengbo Liu","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Chengbo","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085850693"},{"name":"Yafei Hou","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Yafei","lastName":"Hou","id":"38247496500"},{"name":"Takeshi Higashino","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Higashino","id":"37311912800"},{"name":"Minoru Okada","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Minoru","lastName":"Okada","id":"37280788100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4099-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4100-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7751581","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7751581","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Amplitude shift keying","Time-domain analysis","Bandwidth","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","amplitude shift keying","codes","error statistics","frequency-domain analysis","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low order M-QAM","orthogonal parallel combinatory ASK modulated multicarrier system","ASK modulation","flexible bandwidth efficiency","BWE","PC code","peak-to-average power ratio performance","PAPR performance","I-phase","Q-phase","PC-OFDM system","BER performance","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","frequency-domain symbol","receiver design","design freedom degree","adaptive modulation","code control"]}],"abstract":"For some scenarios where high received power cannot be guaranteed due to user moving, the OFDM system with low order M-QAM such as BPSK/QPSK is promising. This paper will propose an orthogonal parallel combinatory ASK modulated multicarrier system to achieve flexible bandwidth efficiency (BWE) using low order ASK modulation and parallel combinatory (PC) code. PC code has been shown that it can achieve flexible BWE and better peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) performance. Our proposal will utilize PC code for both I-phase and Q-phase of frequency-domain OFDM symbol which further improve the BWE of PC-OFDM system.

The system is divided into the main pointing device and the auxiliary positioning device. The main positioning device is responsible for screening the identity of the target and obtaining the relevant parameters to determine the general direction of the target while the auxiliary positioning device is responsible for approximation precise positioning.

Firstly, the zero-forcing reception/zero-forcing transmission (ZFR/ZFT) processing matrix with imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the relay is presented.

Finally, simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fairness-aware energy-efficient resource allocation for uplink OFDMA networks with statistical QoS requirements","publicationTitle":"2016 16th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2016.7751591","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 16th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736510/7751579/07751591.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"62","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2016.7751591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7751579","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7751591","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7751591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Fairness-aware energy-efficient resource allocation for uplink OFDMA networks with statistical QoS requirements","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7751591/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497815","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fairness-aware energy-efficient resource allocation for uplink OFDMA networks with statistical QoS requirements","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080982S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736510","isNumber":"7751579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736510","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7751579","articleId":"7751591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7751593,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Lin","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086207566"},{"name":"Xu Pingping","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Pingping","id":"37295071400"},{"name":"Liu Ying","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Ying","id":"37086206226"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4099-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4100-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7751593","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":317},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Interference","Discrete Fourier transforms","Signal to noise ratio","Filter banks","Modulation","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","transient response","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DFT-based channel estimation","FBMC-OQAM wireless communication system","filter bank multi-carrier with offset QAM","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","cyclic prefix","channel impulse response"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FBMC/OQAM","channel estimation","DFT","IAM"]}],"abstract":"Filter bank multi-carrier with offset QAM(FBMC/OQAM) is a multi-carrier modulation technique that can be an alternative to conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing(OFDM) with cyclic prefix (CP) in wireless network.

However, the pilot contamination in Massive MIMO channel estimation process, rooted from the pilot reuse, is a critical problem that severely degrades the performance of the system. This work aims to address the problem of pilot contamination in covariance-aided channel estimation methods while considering practical scenarios where the channel covariance matrices change due to a new user arrival and users mobility. To that end, we first design a method to track the channel covariance matrices and then use these estimated values in Bayesian estimation. Simulation results indicate that the normalized mean square error (NMSE) for both channel covariance matrices and the CSI itself of our proposed methods are much lower than those of classical methods based on least square (LS) and Bayesian estimation. Additionally, for the case that users move slowly (e.g., at walking speed), our proposed method can provide satisfactory performance for more than three times as much as classical Bayesian estimation before system re-train channel covariance matrices. In other words, compared with classical Bayesian methods, our proposed methods are able to get good system performance with less overhead and complexity by a lower frequency of re-training process.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel pilot decontamination methods for Massive MIMO systems under practical scenarios","publicationTitle":"2016 16th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2016.7751595","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 16th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736510/7751579/07751595.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"81","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2016.7751595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7751579","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7751595","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7751595/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Novel pilot decontamination methods for Massive MIMO systems under practical scenarios","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7751595/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497790","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel pilot decontamination methods for Massive MIMO systems under practical scenarios","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052042S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736510","isNumber":"7751579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736510","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7751579","articleId":"7751595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7751596,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Meanwhile, with the GPU acceleration, the proposed method achieves high speed with high accuracy as well.","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2016.7751609","publicationTitle":"2016 16th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 16th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736510/7751579/07751609.pdf","startPage":"141","endPage":"145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2016.7751609","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7751579","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU-accelerated abrupt shot boundary detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7751609","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7751609/","displayDocTitle":"GPU-accelerated abrupt shot boundary detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16488382","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7751609/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU-accelerated abrupt shot boundary detection","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047892S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736510","isNumber":"7751579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736510","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7751579","articleId":"7751609","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7751614,"authors":[{"name":"Shin'ichi Koike","affiliation":["Consultant, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shin'ichi","lastName":"Koike","id":"37335344600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4099-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4100-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7751614","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":36},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive filters","Convergence","Correlation","Filtering algorithms","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Gaussian noise","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","convergence","correlation methods","impulse noise","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive step-size p-modulo correlation phase algorithm","digital QAM systems","digital quadrature amplitude modulation systems","ASS-pModuloCPhiA","adaptive filters","error-and-filter input","adaptive step-size control algorithm","filter convergence speed improvement","impulse noise","adaptive filtering systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["adaptive filter","digital QAM","correlation phase","p-modulus","impulse noise","adaptive step size","fast convergence","robust filtering"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a new adaptation algorithm named Adaptive Step-Size p-Modulo Correlation Phase Algorithm (ASS-pModuloCPhiA) for adaptive filters used in digital QAM systems.

Then, the space-frequency domain subchannel groups (SFD-SCGs) with the same size are obtained by a simplified frequency domain grouping algorithm. The optimal algorithm is used to allocate bits and power for these SFD-SCGs, and the allocation results are saved. Finally, the subchannels with the same serial number are divided into a time-domain subchannel group (SCG-TD). For non-first frames, the bit and power allocation on the sorted sub-channels are as the same as the saved allocation results on the subchannels with the same serial number. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has little performance loss compared with the optimal algorithm, but the complexity of the proposed algorithm is significantly reduced.","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2016.7751670","publicationTitle":"2016 16th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 16th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736510/7751579/07751670.pdf","startPage":"445","endPage":"448","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2016.7751670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7751579","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive resource allocation algorithm based on space-frequency-time domain grouping for MIMO-OFDM system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7751670","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7751670/","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive resource allocation algorithm based on space-frequency-time domain grouping for MIMO-OFDM system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497846","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7751670/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive resource allocation algorithm based on space-frequency-time domain grouping for MIMO-OFDM system","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062437S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736510","isNumber":"7751579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736510","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7751579","articleId":"7751670","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7751675,"authors":[{"name":"Shuyan Ding","affiliation":["China University of Petroleum(East China), Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Shuyan","lastName":"Ding","id":"37085455355"},{"name":"Yang Zhang","affiliation":["China University of Petroleum(East China), Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086199419"},{"name":"Shibao Li","affiliation":["China University of Petroleum(East China), Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Shibao","lastName":"Li","id":"37078125000"},{"name":"Jianhang Liu","affiliation":["China University of Petroleum(East China), Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Jianhang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085463875"},{"name":"Ruo Shu","affiliation":["China University of Petroleum(East China), Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Ruo","lastName":"Shu","id":"37971625900"},{"name":"Zhaozhi Gu","affiliation":["China University of Petroleum(East China), Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Zhaozhi","lastName":"Gu","id":"38239143900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4099-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4100-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7751675","dbTime":"92 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":235},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Partial transmit sequences","Signal processing algorithms","Modulation","Mathematical model","Distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["free-space optical communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["novel PAPR reduction method","ScaledPTS","VLC-OFDM systems","visible light communication-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","clipping algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","Clipping","ScaledPTS","visible light communication","peak-to-average power ratio"]}],"abstract":"In order to solve the problem of low bandwidth utilization while the peak-to-average power ratio(PAPR) is reduced in visible light communication-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (VLC-OFDM) system.

With the development of global satellite communication, spread spectrum communication has also been widely used in satellite communication system. However, spread spectrum communication has many challenges to address, such as multi-user interference, near-far effect, random phase, delay and so on. Multi-user detection technology makes use of spreading sequence, delay, amplitude and phase information of each user for joint detection, which can effectively suppress multiple access interference, make full use of the frequency spectrum resources at the uplink and improve system capacity. Thus, the multiple user detection is one of the key technologies in CDMA communication systems. This paper adopts the multiple user detection scheme that is based on convolution coding block parallel iteration interference cancellation and conducts MATLAB simulation on multiple user detection algorithms.

Furthermore, the impact of time varying error caused by Doppler Shift is also investigated.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 16th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736510/7751579/07751682.pdf","startPage":"500","endPage":"504","publicationTitle":"2016 16th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2016.7751682","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2016.7751682","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7751579","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7751682","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust interference alignment algorithm in a MIMO interference channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Transmitters","Receivers","Signal to noise ratio","Channel estimation","Minimization","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","concave programming","convex programming","Doppler shift","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust interference alignment algorithm","MIMO interference channel","sum rate function","sum rate maximization problem","weighted minimum mean square error algorithm","WMMSE algorithm","channel estimation error","time varying error","Doppler shift","distributed IA algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interference Alignment","IA","MIMO","Pre-coding","R-WMMSE"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7751682/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A robust interference alignment algorithm in a MIMO interference channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7751682/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497842","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust interference alignment algorithm in a MIMO interference channel","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100807S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736510","isNumber":"7751579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736510","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7751579","articleId":"7751682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7751684,"authors":[{"name":"Xuan Sun","affiliation":["Beijing Information Science & Technology University, Peking, China"],"firstName":"Xuan","lastName":"Sun","id":"37086204878"},{"name":"Xin Gao","affiliation":["The National Computer network Emergency Response technical, Team Coordination Center of China, Peking, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Gao","id":"37086210745"},{"name":"Chen Li","affiliation":["Beijing Information Science & Technology University, Peking, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Li","id":"37086208304"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4099-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4100-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7751684","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Sparse matrices","Compressed sensing","Event detection","Mathematical model","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","computerised instrumentation","graph theory","Internet of Things","message passing","parity check codes","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["abnormal event detection","Internet of Things","sparse parity check matrix","LDPC code","fusion center","compressed sensing equations","cluster-heads","message passing algorithm","Tanner graph"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IoT","abnormal events","LDPC","compressed sensing"]}],"abstract":"In order to improve the efficiency of abnormal event detection for Internet of Things, this paper proposes an abnormal event detection scheme based on compressed sensing. Due to the low energy consumption target constraints, the cluster-head often has no ability to collect all the data of the terminal nodes. Therefore, a sparse model of terminal nodes is proposed, which is applied to the WSNs scenario. When the number of nodes to be collected is far beyond the ability to collect data, the sparse model is used to propose a distributed abnormal event detection scheme. Each cluster-head uses the compressed sensing method to collect the data. During the procedure, data collection rules are in accordance with the sparse parity check matrix of LDPC code. In the fusion center, the compressed sensing equations of these cluster-heads will be combined into a complete equation. Then the Message Passing algorithm based on Tanner Graph is used to reconstruct the abnormal event sensing results of the sensor nodes.","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2016.7751684","publicationTitle":"2016 16th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 16th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736510/7751579/07751684.pdf","startPage":"509","endPage":"513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2016.7751684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7751579","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A joint abnormal event detection scheme based on compressed sensing for Internet of Things","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7751684","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7751684/","displayDocTitle":"A joint abnormal event detection scheme based on compressed sensing for Internet of Things","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497870","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7751684/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A joint abnormal event detection scheme based on compressed sensing for Internet of Things","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084959S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736510","isNumber":"7751579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736510","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7751579","articleId":"7751684","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7751693,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Yang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086198497"},{"name":"Jiaming Hu","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiaming","lastName":"Hu","id":"37086210436"},{"name":"Yuqi Shi","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuqi","lastName":"Shi","id":"37086198959"},{"name":"Rui Liu","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086206012"},{"name":"Songlin Sun","affiliation":["San Jose State University, San Jose, California"],"firstName":"Songlin","lastName":"Sun","id":"37086209394"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4099-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4100-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7751693","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Reflection coefficient","Ceramics","Reflection","Azimuth","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave diffraction","electromagnetic wave reflection","indoor communication","MIMO communication","radiowave propagation","ray tracing","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D MIMO channel modeling","indoor communication","three-dimensional multiple-input multiple-output technique","diffraction coefficients","signal propagation","ray-tracing method","ceramic walls","reflection coefficients","spatial spectrums","MUSIC algorithm","frequency 2.4 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D-MIMO","ray-tracing","reflection coefficient","MUSIC algorithm"]}],"abstract":"The channel model of propagation characteristics is significant in the study of three-dimensional multiple-input multiple-output (3D-MIMO) technique.

Due to channel hardening of massive MIMO, this paper directly investigates the approximate network throughput with zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) and conjugate beamforming (CBF) schemes when channel state information (CSI) acquisition is imperfect. In addition, we investigate downtilts of antenna patterns at the base stations. To further improve the throughput of massive MIMO networks, we propose a beam switching tilting strategy which adopts different downtilts to serve each divided vertical region. A partition time-slots algorithm is developed according to the number of users in each region. Our results show the performance by using our proposed algorithm, and also reveal that ZFBF outperforms CBF due to less intra-cell interference.","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2016.7751696","publicationTitle":"2016 16th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 16th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736510/7751579/07751696.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2016.7751696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7751579","startPage":"569","endPage":"573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal downtilts for 3D beamforming in massive MIMO networks with imperfect CSI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7751696","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal downtilts for 3D beamforming in massive MIMO networks with imperfect CSI","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7751696/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497888","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7751696/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal downtilts for 3D beamforming in massive MIMO networks with imperfect CSI","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.133695S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736510","isNumber":"7751579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736510","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7751579","articleId":"7751696","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7751698,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Bi","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Bi","id":"37086199543"},{"name":"Xiaojun Jing","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Xiaojun","lastName":"Jing","id":"37532421600"},{"name":"Songlin Sun","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Songlin","lastName":"Sun","id":"37597424300"},{"name":"Hai Huang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Post and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Huang","id":"37068160800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4099-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4100-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7751698","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7751698","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Cognitive radio","Fading channels","Reliability","Collaboration","Clustering algorithms","Gaussian distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","pattern clustering","radio spectrum management","sensor fusion","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical fusion-based cooperative spectrum sensing scheme","cognitive radio networks","deep fading","multipath effect","hidden terminal problem","spectrum resources","data processing","fusion center","cognitive information transmission","location-based method","cluster heads","energy detection","reputation-based method","energy consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio networks","cooperative spectrum sensing","cluster"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2016.7751698","publicationTitle":"2016 16th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 16th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736510/7751579/07751698.pdf","startPage":"579","endPage":"583","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2016.7751698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7751579","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical fusion-based cooperative spectrum sensing scheme in cognitive radio networks","abstract":"Cooperative spectrum sensing scheme has a good effect on the problem of hidden terminal, multipath effect and deep fading.

In this scheme, spectrum sensing consists of two steps. The offline training is performed by K-means clustering method and the threshold is defined by the classification result towards unsupervised data. As for the online classification stage, the similarity between the received signal and the cluster in training data is exploited for channel availability decision. The features of both the received signal and the training samples are extracted by principle component analysis (PCA). The fusion center will make final decision according to the local sensing result from differently sensors sequentially. Each sensor is responsible for the analysis towards certain period of the received signal. In this way, the initial sensing result (which will be updated due to the latest input signal) is available within short period of time. If the primary signal existed, the initial sensing result can stop further detection which improves the efficiency of spectrum sensing and avoid more interference to primary users. Compare to the existed methods of spectrum sensing, the threshold of the proposed scheme is measured by feature similarity in multi-dimension rather than a fixed value. In simulation, we evaluate the performance by making comparison between different method and the result reveals that our scheme can achieve better performance and work efficiently.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7751703/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16497877","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7751703/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Principle component analysis based cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Principle component analysis based cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040102S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736510","isNumber":"7751579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736510","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7751579","articleId":"7751703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7751704,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Chen","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China","Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Trustworthy Distributed Computing and Service (BUPT)"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086211105"},{"name":"Yue Li","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China","Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Trustworthy Distributed Computing and Service (BUPT)"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Li","id":"37086210700"},{"name":"Songlin Sun","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China","Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Trustworthy Distributed Computing and Service (BUPT)"],"firstName":"Songlin","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085669038"},{"name":"Xinzhou Cheng","affiliation":["China Unicom Network Technology Research Institute, China"],"firstName":"Xinzhou","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37086208629"},{"name":"Xuqi Chen","affiliation":["Posts & Telecommunications Planning and Designing Institute Co., Ltd, China"],"firstName":"Xuqi","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086206452"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4099-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4100-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7751704","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":266},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7751704","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Antenna arrays","Receiving antennas","Channel models","Fading channels","Transmitting antennas","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","numerical analysis","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["twin-multi ring channel model","massive MIMO system","spherical wave assumption","time axes","array axes","cluster appearance","cluster disappearance","cluster generation algorithm","numerical analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO channel","channel model","spherical wave"]}],"abstract":"A Massive MIMO system is equipped with more antennas than traditional MIMO system.

Cyclostationary feature based spectrum sensing has proven preferable to other methods under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions. To detect the presence of primary signals, conventional cyclostationary feature based schemes tend to simply compare the values of signal features to a predefined threshold. However, such schemes would lead to dramatic performance degradation when signal features are overwhelmed by noise. This paper proposes a novel scheme that applies the low-rank and sparse decomposition technique to cyclostationary feature based spectrum sensing. The spectrum correlation function matrix is decomposed into two matrices, of which the low-rank one represents noise and interference while the sparse one represents cyclostationary features of PU signal. Subsequently, the scheme takes advantage of the signal features in the sparse matrix to determine the presence of PU signal. Simulation results have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed scheme in terms of detection probability and false alarm probability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7751706/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16497884","htmlLink":"/document/7751706/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Cyclostationary feature based spectrum sensing via low-rank and sparse decomposition in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cyclostationary feature based spectrum sensing via low-rank and sparse decomposition in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108325S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736510","isNumber":"7751579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736510","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7751579","articleId":"7751706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7751707,"authors":[{"name":"Li Zhang","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280177700"},{"name":"Hai Huang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085383224"},{"name":"Xiaojun Jing","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Xiaojun","lastName":"Jing","id":"37532421600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4099-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4100-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7751707","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":326},"abstract":"In this paper, a modified Cyclostationary Feature Detection (CFD) algorithm based on softmax regression model is proposed, which targets for improving the sensing performance under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Interference alignment (IA) is a prospective technique for interference management, and can significantly improve the performance of cognitive radio (CR) networks. Besides, power allocation (PA) in IA-based CR networks is greatly neglected, which can further reinforce its performance. Thus in our paper, PA in IA-based CR networks is analyzed. To satisfy the QoS requirement of the PU, its minimal transmitted power is derived. To maximize the total rate of CRN and maintain the fairness between the competing SUs, the system is modeled as an optimization problem with the constraints of transmission power in IA-based cognitive radio.

Monte Carlo simulation results show that compared with the traditional energy detection algorithm, the detection performance of the system is improved, and the detection probability is higher than that of the traditional energy detection algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2016.7751714","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 16th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736510/7751579/07751714.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7751579","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2016.7751714","publicationTitle":"2016 16th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)","startPage":"651","endPage":"654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved energy detection algorithm based on signal correlation in cognitive radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7751714","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"An improved energy detection algorithm based on signal correlation in cognitive radio","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7751714/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7751714/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497779","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved energy detection algorithm based on signal correlation in cognitive radio","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050047S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736510","isNumber":"7751579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736510","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7751579","articleId":"7751714","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7751715,"authors":[{"name":"Fukang Hou","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Trustworthy Distributed Computing and Service (BUPT), Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Fukang","lastName":"Hou","id":"37086206202"},{"name":"Xin Chen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Trustworthy Distributed Computing and Service (BUPT), Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086206410"},{"name":"Hai Huang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Huang","id":"37068160800"},{"name":"Xiaojun Jing","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Trustworthy Distributed Computing and Service (BUPT), Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Xiaojun","lastName":"Jing","id":"37532421600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4099-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4100-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7751715","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":253},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","cognitive radio","frequency-domain analysis","signal detection","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["throughput performance improvement","cognitive radio networks","spectrum sensing","BP neural network","frequency domain","time domain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["spectrum prediction","cognitive radio networks","BP neural network","frame structure","throughput"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput performance improvement in cognitive radio networks based on spectrum prediction","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2016.7751715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7751579","endPage":"658","publicationTitle":"2016 16th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 16th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736510/7751579/07751715.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2016.7751715","startPage":"655","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7751715","abstract":"Spectrum sensing is used to detect spectrum holes and find active primary users while randomly selecting channel for sensing leads to secondary user's low throughput in cognitive radio networks.

The proposed scheme can effectively sense the vacant spectrum and users based on 3D angular scan and schedule the users with optimized 3D codebook.

This inclusion in power system promotes Micro-grid system to optimize the overall distribution. FPGA, elaborated as Field Programmable Gate Array, proposes chances for enhanced performance and coveted flexibility in design for the digital control. Conversely, the erudite convolution of the Hardware Description Language (HDL) coding, a way translating to HDL, can be an undesirable hurdle for the professional system designers. The design, depicted in this letter, is an instance of system modeling for FPGA-based digital control, which necessarily has the desired ability to auto-generate the HDL codes. The architecture of this design uses the DSP Builder technology, in a MATLAB / SIMULINK platform. A three phase full-bridge gird tied inverter for wind system and a three phase full-bridge inverter for grid connected wind system are built that demonstrates the close correlation with the model.

These new energy sources highly impact the planning and operation of our electrical system. More flexibility is now required for electrical system operators to be able to counterpace the increase of power variability and unwished energy flow in their networks. Energy storage systems are a possible flexibility and thus open new challenges about research works and studies for grid applications. The task of this paper is to study the use of a lithium-ion battery to remove constraints in electrical grids and to increase the penetration of renewable energy sources in the liberalized electricity market. A linearized model of a lithium-ion battery is presented and is used in an optimization framework. This one is then used to calculate the optimal schedule of storage load and discharge actions in order to produce the highest possible benefits while taking into account hardware and grid constraints. An application in an industrial microgrid is presented to reduce the operation energy cost.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference

Suitable converters are normally used to determine the encoded position from the transducer signals. Frequently, the signals present defects, particularly displaying phase and amplitude imbalances. Such defects have detrimental effects on the angle measurement precision. An online method for correcting the transducers signals is presented in this work. This allows elimination of unbalance errors and enable the converters to work properly. The proposed method is based on using three different data points to carry out the correction. Each data point consists of a pair of values of the transducer signals without the need for knowledge of the actual angle itself. A simple algorithm, that may be implemented on a simple microcontroller or processor, performs automatic correction based on the proposed technique. The paper presents details of the theory, algorithm, and simulation results which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transducers","Windings","Sensors","Signal resolution","Demodulation","Phase locked loops","Biomedical measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["position control","position measurement","signal processing","transducers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online amplitude imbalance correction","phase imbalance correction","sinusoidal encoder signal","sinusoidal transducer","angular position sensor","speed sensor","cosine signal","position encoding","angle measurement precision","transducer signal correction","microcontroller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Resolvers","Sinusoidal Encoders","Rotational Motion Control","Amplitude-Phase Imbalances","Compensation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EPEPEMC.2016.7752093","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference (PEMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference (PEMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736341/7751961/07752093.pdf","startPage":"784","endPage":"789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7751961","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPEPEMC.2016.7752093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel method for online correction of amplitude and phase imbalances in sinusoidal encoders signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752093","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel method for online correction of amplitude and phase imbalances in sinusoidal encoders signals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752093/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752093/","accessionNumber":"16488260","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel method for online correction of amplitude and phase imbalances in sinusoidal encoders signals","confLoc":"Varna, Bulgaria","sourcePdf":"0784vf006394.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06404S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736341","isNumber":"7751961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736341","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7751961","articleId":"7752093","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7752143,"authors":[{"name":"Kamil Klimkowski","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Machines, Drives and Measurements, Wroclaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Kamil","lastName":"Klimkowski","id":"37085416572"},{"name":"Mateusz Dybkowski","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Machines, Drives and Measurements, Wroclaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Mateusz","lastName":"Dybkowski","id":"38274987100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1798-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1797-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1799-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7752143","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":280},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stators","Current measurement","Phase measurement","Rotors","Torque measurement","Neural networks","Fault detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","fault tolerant control","induction motor drives","machine vector control","neurocontrollers","redundancy","stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor drive","stator current sensor fault detection","stator current sensor fault isolation","vector controlled induction motor drive","fault tolerant direct field oriented control","artificial neural network approach","control topology redundancy","DS1202 card","post-fault conditions"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752143","abstract":"The paper deals with the fault tolerant Direct Field Oriented Control of an induction motor drive.

These currents cause abominable effects in electronics devices and develop voltage at motor shaft. When voltage exceeds dielectric breakdown voltage of lubricant film, it develops a huge bearing current which can damage bearings in very short interval. This paper emphasis on mitigation of CM currents and bearing currents by minimizing CMV produced by inverter-motor system based on selection and refinement of PWM algorithm without any additional hardware change. Multilevel inverters are apt for industrial applications due to low voltage distortion and less stress on switching devices than conventional two level inverter. To Investigate the effects on CMV, CM currents, bearing currents and motor shaft voltage, a high frequency Induction Motor (IM) model was chosen and analysis was done with different PWM techniques. The present work focused on three level Diode Clamped MultiLevel Inverter (DCMLI) and proposed new Space vector Pulse width Modulation (SVPWM) by choosing reductant CMV vectors in combination with sequence of changing one state in phase during switching transition. The proposed SVPWM technique shows the effectiness to reduce CMV as well as Electro-Magnetic Interference (EMI) and validated using MATLAB simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752161/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7752161/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16488222","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A SVPWM for reduction in common mode and bearing currents applied to diode clamped three-level inverter fed induction motor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A SVPWM for reduction in common mode and bearing currents applied to diode clamped three-level inverter fed induction motor","confLoc":"Varna, Bulgaria","sourcePdf":"1170vf002224.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072928S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736341","isNumber":"7751961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736341","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7751961","articleId":"7752161","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7752165,"authors":[{"name":"I.

One of the challenges is voltage balancing. Indeed, when supplying powers coming from renewable sources are different, the inverter input voltages are unbalanced. In this paper, a stable DC bus voltage balancing technique without modifying MPPT algorithm is presented. This allows an MPPT operating independently on each renewable source maximizing total absorbed power. In this work, the power topology includes two boost converters (one for each single source) and a 3-level Neutral Point Clamped (NPC) inverter. The boost converters are used to implement independent MPPT for each renewable source while the proposed voltage balancing is realized by modifying the inverter control. The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate the stability of the proposed technique. Simulation and experimental results confirm the effectiveness and the stability of the voltage balancing technique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752165/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7752165/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16488169","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Stable DC bus voltage balancing in a renewable source grid connected neutral point clamped inverter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stable DC bus voltage balancing in a renewable source grid connected neutral point clamped inverter","confLoc":"Varna, Bulgaria","sourcePdf":"1194vf001902.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085265S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736341","isNumber":"7751961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736341","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7751961","articleId":"7752165","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7752207,"authors":[{"name":"Abhijnan Chakraborty","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Abhijnan","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"37086204180"},{"name":"Bhargavi Paranjape","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Bhargavi","lastName":"Paranjape","id":"37086200013"},{"name":"Sourya Kakarla","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Sourya","lastName":"Kakarla","id":"37086206960"},{"name":"Niloy Ganguly","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Niloy","lastName":"Ganguly","id":"37401796200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2846-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2845-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2847-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7752207","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":82,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2551},"abstract":"Most of the online news media outlets rely heavily on the revenues generated from the clicks made by their readers, and due to the presence of numerous such outlets, they need to compete with each other for reader attention. To attract the readers to click on an article and subsequently visit the media site, the outlets often come up with catchy headlines accompanying the article links, which lure the readers to click on the link. Such headlines are known as Clickbaits. While these baits may trick the readers into clicking, in the long-run, clickbaits usually don't live up to the expectation of the readers, and leave them disappointed. In this work, we attempt to automatically detect clickbaits and then build a browser extension which warns the readers of different media sites about the possibility of being baited by such headlines. The extension also offers each reader an option to block clickbaits she doesn't want to see.

This is the motivation that has led the work of this paper towards the development of a new graph sampling algorithm. Previous research in this area proposed simple processes such as the classic Random Walk algorithm, Random node and Random edge sampling and has evolved during the last decade to more advanced graph exploration approaches such as Forest Fire and Frontier sampling. In this paper, we propose a new graph sampling method based on edge selection. In addition, we crawled Facebook collecting a large dataset consisting of 10 million users and 80 million users' relations, which we have also used to evaluate our sampling algorithm. The experimental evaluation on several datasets proves that our approach preserves several properties of the initial graphs, leading to representative samples and outperforms all the other approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ASONAM.2016.7752223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASONAM.2016.7752223","startPage":"120","endPage":"129","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736513/7752180/07752223.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rank degree: An efficient algorithm for graph sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Rank degree: An efficient algorithm for graph sampling","conferenceDate":"18-21 Aug. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752223/","accessionNumber":"16497922","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752223/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rank degree: An efficient algorithm for graph sampling","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"018120139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111861S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736513","isNumber":"7752180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736513","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7752180","articleId":"7752223","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7752331,"authors":[{"name":"Claudia Meda","affiliation":["Dept. of Electric Electronic and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Claudia","lastName":"Meda","id":"37085373063"},{"name":"Edoardo Ragusa","affiliation":["Dept. of Electric Electronic and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Edoardo","lastName":"Ragusa","id":"37086198568"},{"name":"Christian Gianoglio","affiliation":["Dept. of Electric Electronic and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Gianoglio","id":"37086204373"},{"name":"Rodolfo Zunino","affiliation":["Dept. of Electric Electronic and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Rodolfo","lastName":"Zunino","id":"37265496900"},{"name":"Augusto Ottaviano","affiliation":["Ministry of the Interior, Italian National Police, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Augusto","lastName":"Ottaviano","id":"37085755506"},{"name":"Eugenio Scillia","affiliation":["Ministry of the Interior, Italian National Police, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Eugenio","lastName":"Scillia","id":"37085762528"},{"name":"Roberto Surlinelli","affiliation":["Ministry of the Interior, Italian National Police, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Surlinelli","id":"37085763975"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2846-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2845-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2847-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7752331","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":294},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Twitter","Classification algorithms","Training","Vegetation","Feature extraction","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information filtering","law administration","learning (artificial intelligence)","sampling methods","social networking (online)","unsolicited e-mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spam detection","Twitter traffic","random forests","nonuniform feature sampling","law enforcement agencies","open data","troublesome information filtering","social networks","microblogs","malicious contents","gray box machine learning system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spam detection","Social Network Analysis","Cyber Security","Automated Tools"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752331","abstract":"Law Enforcement Agencies cover a crucial role in the analysis of open data and need effective techniques to filter troublesome information.

These fast-increasing volumes of data pose challenges to computational methods for annotation. Machine learning approaches, primarily supervised algorithms, have been widely used to assist with classification tasks in bioinformatics. However, supervised algorithms rely on large amounts of labeled data in order to produce quality predictors. Oftentimes, labeled data is difficult and expensive to acquire in sufficiently large quantities. When only limited amounts of labeled data but considerably larger amounts of unlabeled data are available for a specific annotation problem, semi-supervised learning approaches represent a cost-effective alternative. In this work, we focus on a special case of semi-supervised learning, namely transductive learning, in which the algorithm has access during the training phase to the instances that need to be labeled. Transduction is particularly suitable for biological sequence classification, where the goal is generally to label a given set of unlabeled instances. However, a challenge that needs to be addressed in this context consists of identification of compact sets of informative features. Given the lack of labeled data, standard supervised feature selection methods may result in unreliable features. Therefore, we study recently proposed unsupervised feature construction approaches together with transductive learning. Experimental results on two classification problems, namely cassette exon identification and protein localization, show that the unsupervised features result in better performance than the supervised features.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736513/7752180/07752363.pdf","startPage":"999","endPage":"1006","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)","doi":"10.1109/ASONAM.2016.7752363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASONAM.2016.7752363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752180","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752363","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of transductive learning and unsupervised feature construction methods for biological sequence classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prediction algorithms","Proteins","Bioinformatics","Support vector machines","Machine learning algorithms","DNA"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","proteins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transductive learning","unsupervised feature construction methods","biological sequence classification","next generation sequencing technologies","NGS technologies","biological sequence data","nucleotide sequences","protein sequences","machine learning","supervised algorithms","bioinformatics","semisupervised learning","standard supervised feature selection methods","cassette exon identification","protein localization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752363/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Study of transductive learning and unsupervised feature construction methods for biological sequence classification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752363/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16488520","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"18-21 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of transductive learning and unsupervised feature construction methods for biological sequence classification","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"158999210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084872S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736513","isNumber":"7752180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736513","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7752180","articleId":"7752363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7752424,"authors":[{"name":"Ze Li","affiliation":["College of Information System and Management, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Ze","lastName":"Li","id":"37085626692"},{"name":"Duo-yong Sun","affiliation":["College of Information System and Management, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Duo-yong","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085473445"},{"name":"Jie Li","affiliation":["College of Information System and Management, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Li","id":"37085814067"},{"name":"Zhan-feng Li","affiliation":["College of Information System and Management, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Zhan-feng","lastName":"Li","id":"37085775873"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2846-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2845-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2847-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7752424","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":287},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Social network services","Neural networks","Genetic algorithms","Organizations","Electronic mail","Robustness","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","genetic algorithms","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["social network change detection","genetic algorithm","back propagation","positive organizational activities","negative organizational activities","GABP neural network model","dynamic network behavior types","Enron social networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Social Network Analysis","Change Detection","GABP Neural Network","Enron Dataset"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752424","abstract":"Changes in social networks may reflect an underlying significant events or behaviors within an organization.

Simulation results demonstrate that the SL0 algorithm can obtain a better performance than the traditional orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) method in reconstruction of speech signals.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752443","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752443.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speech reconstruction based on compressed sensing theory using smoothed L0 algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752443","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Speech reconstruction based on compressed sensing theory using smoothed L0 algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752443/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497705","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7752443/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech reconstruction based on compressed sensing theory using smoothed L0 algorithm","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570280763.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047412S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752443","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7752445,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Li","id":"37085660683"},{"name":"Hong Ding","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Ding","id":"37086077127"},{"name":"Linhua Zheng","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Linhua","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37877354000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752445","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":244},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","Reliability","Decoding","Heuristic algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","gradient methods","iterative decoding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid iterative decoding","LDPC codes","gradient descent bit-flipping algorithm","low-density parity-check codes","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC codes","GDBF algorithm","iterative decoding","low complexity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752445","abstract":"Gradient descent bit-flipping (GDBF) decoding for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes has gained great attentions because of low complexity and relatively good performance.

In this paper, a Stackelberg game is proposed to solve the interests' conflict in D2D-enabled wireless caching networks, where exist two kinds of users including subscribers and helpers. System model is characterized by a hierarchical structure, where the macro base station (MBS) optimizes its strategy based on the prices of helpers. Then, the optimal price and optimal power are derived in closed-forms. Simulations are carried out in three environments which include one helper, two helpers and three helpers in the network, respectively. In one-helper situation, the utilities of MBS and helper decrease as the distance increases. The tradeoffs between power and prices are presented in the simulation results of two-helpers and three-helpers situations. It can be seen that the utility of MBS is concave over power for the reasons that the increased profits are dominated firstly and then the cost substantially increases.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Device-to-device communication","Games","Wireless communication","Base stations","Mathematical model","Cellular networks","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","game theory","telecommunication traffic","video communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Stackelberg game","wireless video traffic","cellular networks","device-to-device enabled caching technology","network backhaul traffic pressures","D2D-enabled wireless caching networks","macrobase station"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752449","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752449.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752449","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"D2D-enabled wireless caching using Stackelberg game","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752449","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"D2D-enabled wireless caching using Stackelberg game","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752449/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752449/","accessionNumber":"16497560","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"D2D-enabled wireless caching using Stackelberg game","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570286275.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054237S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752449","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7752450,"authors":[{"name":"Mangang Xie","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Engineering, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou, P.R.

In addition, a large-scale array is employed to overcome the high path loss of the mmWave channels. Due to the large number of antennas and the directional feature of the channels, a base station (BS) will mainly rely on the uplink sounding signals instead of the explicit channel estimation to obtain the angles of arrivals/departures (AoAs/AoDs) to perform directional beamforming.

Compared to the digital precoder, it is more challenging to design the analog precoder because of the constant amplitude (CA) constraints on the entries. Although high-resolution analog phase shifters (APSs) can provide more choices in phase adjustment, it also adds the difficulty in designing effective codebooks for beam selection. In addition, the finer APSs are accompanied by the higher hardware cost and power consumption. Driven by the low hardware cost and power consumption, we employ one-bit APSs to perform analog precoding. A simple codebook for hierarchical searching is designed. Then a low-complexity hierarchical beam selection algorithm is devised to reduce the training overhead. An approximate expression of spectral efficiency after hybrid precoding in one-bit-APS system is also derived, which is close to the simulation results in medium signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Despite a performance degradation, both the theoretical analysis and the simulation results show that the performance is still comparable to the existing alternatives with much lower training overhead and hardware cost. Therefore, the proposed one-bit-APS system can be an acceptable tradeoff in practical implementation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical beam selection in mmWave multiuser MIMO systems with one-bit analog phase shifters","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752457","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752457.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752457","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752457/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical beam selection in mmWave multiuser MIMO systems with one-bit analog phase shifters","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752457/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497635","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical beam selection in mmWave multiuser MIMO systems with one-bit analog phase shifters","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570289341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065206S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7752470,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Ding","affiliation":["State Key Lab. for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, China","School of Information Engineering, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Ding","id":"37898784200"},{"name":"Yang Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085834217"},{"name":"Jing Yang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085653532"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752470","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","MIMO","Antennas","Interference","Channel estimation","System performance","Fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","fading channels","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","radiofrequency interference","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["achievable rate analysis","multipair amplify-and-forward massive MIMO system","multipair AF massive MIMO systems","imperfect channel state information","imperfect CSI","power-scaling laws","zero forcing reception","zero forcing transmission","ZFT/ZFR algorithm","MMSE estimator","interuser interference","channel errors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AF massive MIMO system ZFT/ZFR algorithm","imperfect CSI"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a multi-pair amplify-and-forward (AF) massive MIMO system is investigated, where multiple source users communicate with multiple destination users via a single relay.

We formulate this problem as the maximization of the minimum EE of CUs, subject to their minimum data rate requirements and transmit power constraints. However, the problem is nonconvex and NP-hard due to its non-convex fractional objective and the complicated intra-cell interference term. In order to tackle this issue, we address it by solving its equivalent auxiliary problem based on fractional programming, and achieve the optimal minimum EE by the bisection method. Wherein an efficient iterative power control algorithm based on sequential convex programming is devised to obtain the local optimal transmit power. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is convergent and insensitive to the initial transmit power, and verify that the max-min fair power control scheme can guarantee good fairness of EE among CUs with high EE.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752473","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752473.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Max-min fair power control algorithm in massive MIMO cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752473","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752473/","displayDocTitle":"Max-min fair power control algorithm in massive MIMO cognitive radio networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497729","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752473/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Max-min fair power control algorithm in massive MIMO cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570290813.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067669S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7752475,"authors":[{"name":"Haisheng Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haisheng","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085460173"},{"name":"Wenyun Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenyun","lastName":"Gao","id":"37085655649"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752475","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Shape","Approximation algorithms","MIMO radar","Covariance matrices","MIMO","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concave programming","convex programming","covariance matrices","mean square error methods","MIMO radar","minimisation","radar signal processing","relaxation theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SDR","semidefinite relaxation","QCQP","nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programming","SDP optimization algorithm","convex toolbox","semidefinite programming","MSE minimization","ISL minimization","mean square error minimization","integrated sidelobe level minimization","PAM","power approximation method","WCVM design","waveform covariance matrix design","WCEM design","beampattern matching","MISL-based colocated MIMO radar waveform coefficient matrix design"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we focus on waveform coefficient matrix (WCEM) design to perform matched beampattern design with lower sidelobe level for generalized MIMO configurations. First, the relationship between transmit waveforms and beam-pattern, and the limitation of conventional waveform covariance matrix (WCVM) design are briefly discussed. Then a power approximation method (PAM) by minimizing both integrated sidelobe level (ISL) and mean square error (MSE) for beampattern formation is proposed. Based on the proposed method, two optimization algorithms are designed according to the different types of WCEM. The first algorithm is to solve a semi-definite programming (SDP), thus convex toolbox is directly used, while the second algorithm is to solve a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP), then randomized semi-definite relaxation (SDR) is proposed to determine feasible solutions close to the solution to the original problem. Finally, numerical comparisons with classical methods demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can obtain well-matched beampatterns with lower sidelobe levels.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752475","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752475.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752475","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MISL-based colocated MIMO radar waveform coefficients matrix design for beampattern matching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752475","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752475/","displayDocTitle":"MISL-based colocated MIMO radar waveform coefficients matrix design for beampattern matching","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497529","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752475/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MISL-based colocated MIMO radar waveform coefficients matrix design for beampattern matching","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570290836.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071313S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7752477,"authors":[{"name":"Wenqiang Chen","affiliation":["Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Wenqiang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085775141"},{"name":"Lusheng Wang","affiliation":["Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Lusheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"38467979900"},{"name":"Yuqi Fan","affiliation":["Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Yuqi","lastName":"Fan","id":"37085771028"},{"name":"Hai Lin","affiliation":["Wuhan University Luojia Mountain, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086046498"},{"name":"Xueli Wei","affiliation":["Wuhan University Luojia Mountain, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xueli","lastName":"Wei","id":"37086045897"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752477","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"abstract":"In dense mobile communication systems, time efficiency is a vital demand for resource allocation (RA), as well as inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC), due to the fact that the scale of RA optimization is extremely large. Existing optimization schemes, such as Hungarian algorithm, are too time-consuming to reach an optimal solution, which does not fit for RA in dense scenarios. In this paper, we employ the compressive sensing (CS) technique to design a CS-based scheme, which uses wavelet transform, Hadamard matrix, and CoSaMP algorithm for sparse representation, measurement, and reconstruction, respectively. Simulation results show the sparsity, the feasibility, and the gain of time efficiency by using the CS technique.

We aim at maximizing the energy efficiency (EE) in the multihop relay network by jointly optimizing the payload length and average transmission energy per bit over all hops, with no limitation on the total number of (re)transmissions times. The theoretical findings are verified by simulations and the impacts of various parameters, e.g., the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) levels, channel gains and transmission distance, on EE are studied in detail. The results demonstrate that significant energy saving can be achieved by the proposed joint optimum algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An energy-efficient design for multihop relay network adopting CC-HARQ scheme","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752479","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752479.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752479","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752479/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"An energy-efficient design for multihop relay network adopting CC-HARQ scheme","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752479/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497757","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An energy-efficient design for multihop relay network adopting CC-HARQ scheme","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570290857.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068824S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7752480,"authors":[{"name":"Yuki Arikawa","affiliation":["NTT Device Innovation Center, NTT Corporation, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuki","lastName":"Arikawa","id":"37085662855"},{"name":"Hiroyuki Uzawa","affiliation":["NTT Device Innovation Center, NTT Corporation, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Uzawa","id":"38015198200"},{"name":"Takeshi Sakamoto","affiliation":["NTT Device Innovation Center, NTT Corporation, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Sakamoto","id":"37069041500"},{"name":"Satoshi Shigematsu","affiliation":["NTT Device Innovation Center, NTT Corporation, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Shigematsu","id":"37085533377"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752480","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":479},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","5G mobile communication","Antenna arrays","UHF antennas","Convergence","Scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","mobile antennas","resource allocation","telecommunication scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed radio-resource scheduling","ultra-high-density distributed antenna systems","5G mobile communications systems","user equipment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G mobile commnuications systems","resource scheduling","distributed antenna systems"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a high-speed radio-resource scheduling scheme that achieves higher system throughput in ultra-high-density distributed antenna systems for 5G mobile communications systems.

However, MBM combined with forward error correction (FEC) codes is limited to hard decision decoding in the literature, which causes a performance loss. In this paper, a novel scheme is proposed, called polar coded MBM (PCMBM), to provide a higher coding gain and better overall system performance. The proposed PCMBM scheme maps the channel index in the frozen polar set and the other information in the free polar set. The advantage is that the bits that identify the channel do not need to be detected. Based on soft decision metric, this scheme makes full use of the received information by computing the exact likelihood ratio (LR). Furthermore, we analyze the channel capacity of PCMBM which is essential for polar coding and give a low-complexity approach based on sphere decoding to calculate bit LR. Simulation results show that this scheme is approximately 0.7 dB better than MBM with LDPC codes at BER 1e-6 under given conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752485/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752485/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497580","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Polar coded media-based modulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polar coded media-based modulation","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570291049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.142629S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7752486,"authors":[{"name":"Jia-Ling Li","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Donghua University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jia-Ling","lastName":"Li","id":"37086003596"},{"name":"Wen Chen","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Donghua University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086004982"},{"name":"Xue-Qin Jiang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Donghua University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xue-Qin","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37403103700"},{"name":"Xiao-Dong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiao-Dong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37834442200"},{"name":"Hui-Ming Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Hui-Ming","lastName":"Wang","id":"37405983100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752486","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":196},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752486","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matrix decomposition","Bipartite graph","Iterative decoding","Electronic mail","Simulation","AWGN channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","cyclic codes","iterative decoding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-rate quasi-cyclic LDPC codes","girth eight","quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check codes","bipartite graph","Moore graph","QC-LDPC codes","iterative decoding","AWGN channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Moore graph","QC-LDPC codes","column decomposing"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a new approach to construct quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes of girth 8.

However, existing beamspace channel estimation schemes are based on the 2D beamspace channel model. In this paper, we consider the more general 3D beamspace channel model, and propose an adaptive support detection (ASD)-based channel estimation scheme. The basic idea is to decompose the 3D beamspace channel estimation problem into several sub-problems, and each one only deals with a sparse channel component. For each channel component, we first adaptively detect its support with high accuracy by exploiting the horizontal and vertical sparsity of 3D beamspace channel. Then, we remove the influence of this channel component to detect the support of the next channel component. After the support detections of all channel components, we can estimate the nonzero elements of the beamspace channel with low pilot overhead. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme enjoys satisfying accuracy, even with low SNR.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752487.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752487","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752487","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamspace channel estimation for 3D lens-based millimeter-wave massive MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Three-dimensional displays","MIMO","Radio frequency","Antenna arrays","Channel models","Lenses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beamspace channel estimation","3D lens-based millimeter-wave massive MIMO systems","2D beamspace channel model","3D beamspace channel model","adaptive support detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752487/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Beamspace channel estimation for 3D lens-based millimeter-wave massive MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752487/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497745","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamspace channel estimation for 3D lens-based millimeter-wave massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570291110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053533S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7752493,"authors":[{"name":"Mingxia Liu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory (NCRL), Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Mingxia","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086061664"},{"name":"Xiangdong Chen","affiliation":["Communication Bureau, State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Company, China"],"firstName":"Xiangdong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37856185900"},{"name":"Wei Xu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory (NCRL), Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Xu","id":"37536681300"},{"name":"Hua Zhang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory (NCRL), Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37293136800"},{"name":"Xiaohu You","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory (NCRL), Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohu","lastName":"You","id":"37276505600"},{"name":"Weiwei Miao","affiliation":["Communication Bureau, State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Company, China"],"firstName":"Weiwei","lastName":"Miao","id":"37086060174"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752493","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":216},"abstract":"In massive multi-input multi-output systems, the pilot contamination has a strong impact on the performance. In this paper, an advanced channel estimation scheme by utilizing the angles of arrival (AoAs) of cell-edge users is proposed to alleviate the impact of pilot contamination. We exploit angle diversity and low-rank characteristic of the second-order statistical channel information to group cell-edge users, which aims to avoid the detrimental effect of the AoA overlaps between the target users with interfering users. Furthermore, a power control strategy is introduced to reduce the interference brought to the target user, especially the cell-center users. The performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed in terns of the uplink channel capacity.

For traditional opportunistic IA (OIA) scheme, without consideration on enhancing the effectiveness of the desired signal, each user calculates its beamforming vector only based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) of its total leakage of interference (LIF), which leads to the performance deterioration in terms of both the achievable average sum rate and bit error rate (BER). Focusing on K-cell MIMO IMAC, we propose the signal to LIF ratio (SLIR) OIA in this paper, the beamforming vector design criterion of which takes both LIF and desired signal into consideration. Compare with the existing OIA scheme, the proposed SLIR-OIA has the same order of magnitude in computational complexity. Applying the proposed SLIR-OIA algorithm to both perfect and limited feedback scenarios, we evaluate the sum rate and BER performance through simulations, the results of which show that the proposed

Our aim is to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the system by considering the power allocation strategy, while guaranteeing the secrecy rate and the transmit power constraints. We first analyze the impact of pilot attack on the secrecy rate and then prove that the secrecy EE is a concave function with respect to transmit power. The optimization problem formulated can be efficiently solved by using Lagrange multiplier method.

Simulation results show that the the spectral efficiency obtained by the proposed method can approach almost the same level as EESM, while much lower computational complexity is needed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity link adaption for massive MIMO uplink transmission","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752510","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752510.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752510","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752510/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity link adaption for massive MIMO uplink transmission","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752510/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497574","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity link adaption for massive MIMO uplink transmission","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570293964.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059726S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7752511,"authors":[{"name":"Hengyao Wang","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Hengyao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086208234"},{"name":"Xiaoying Zhang","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoying","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086206389"},{"name":"Shan Wang","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Shan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086001773"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752511","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","TV"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","interpolation","OFDM modulation","radiocommunication","radiofrequency interference","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["narrowband interference suppression","OFDM systems","frequency domain interference cancellation algorithm","multitone narrowband interference","coarse interference frequency estimation","spectrum peak search","zero padding interpolation","modified weighted phase average algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","NBI","multi-tone signal","WPA","interference estimation","interference reconstruction","interference cancellation"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes an efficient frequency domain interference cancellation algorithm to solve the narrowband interference (NBI) problem for OFDM systems.

Specifically, the hybrid architecture leads to flexible and efficient resource allocation for cellular users and D2D users, thereby enhancing utilization of spectrum resources. However, if not properly handled, mutual interference will be significantly raised with the proliferation of devices, which bottlenecks the performance of the hybrid system. In this paper, joint mode selection and resource allocation is considered for a sparse code multiple access (SCMA) enabled uplink cellular network. Targeting at maximizing system sum rate, we formulate a joint optimization problem, which, however, is shown to be a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. To solve the problem, we propose a graph-based joint mode selection and resource allocation (GMR) algorithm. GMR is an interference-aware algorithm. In particular, when GMR is applied, D2D users reuse SCMA resources only when the interference level to cellular users is below a predefined threshold. Otherwise, dedicated resources are allocated to D2D users to avoid the overwhelming mutual interference. Simulation results have confirmed the efficacy of GMR in enhancing spectrum efficiency and system sum rate in the hybrid system.","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752515.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graph-based joint mode selection and resource allocation scheme for D2D and cellular hybrid network using SCMA","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752515","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752515","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752515/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Graph-based joint mode selection and resource allocation scheme for D2D and cellular hybrid network using SCMA","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497607","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7752515/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graph-based joint mode selection and resource allocation scheme for D2D and cellular hybrid network using SCMA","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570294655.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072102S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7752516,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Wang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086025057"},{"name":"Zhou Zhou","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085482510"},{"name":"Jun Fang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Fang","id":"37272213800"},{"name":"Zhi Chen","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Chen","id":"37291476200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752516","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":490},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","Training","Radio frequency","Uplink","Compressed sensing","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel estimation","compressed sensing","interference suppression","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive channel estimation","millimeter wave multiuser MIMO systems","mmWave system","uplink channel estimation","fifth generation cellular networks","5G networks","hardware constraints","hybrid analog beamforming structures","digital beamforming structures","base station","mobile stations","pilot reuse scheme","compressed sensing-based method","pilot interference elimination","CS recovery","channel state information","CSI"]}],"abstract":"The multi-user millimeter wave (mmWave) MIMO system has aroused great interest in recent years for future fifth generation (5G) cellular networks.

In this way, the transmitted signal maintains its PS in the desired direction but changes in other directions because of the signal's PS is affected by the designed array gain and the nature of the array pattern causes the PS to appear scrambled in undesired directions.

massive MIMO channel matrix model under real indoor environment at 4.1 GHz is proposed. In this model, the channel matrix can be described as the sum of a fixed and a random matrices, furthermore, the random matrix can be decomposed into the product of four parts: the eigenvectors of the transmitting and receiving side correlation matrices, a coupling matrix, whose amplitude and phase are lognormal and uniform distributions, and a complex Gaussian random matrix. By comparing the capacity and singular value spread, the proposed model is validated to be more accurate than the conventional Kronecker and Weichselberger models. The proposed model is promising for the system design and implementation in future 5G systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752523.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752523","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752523","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement and empirical modeling of massive MIMO channel matrix in real indoor environment","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","correlation methods","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Gaussian processes","indoor radio","log normal distribution","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","random processes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real indoor environment","measurement-based massive MIMO channel matrix model","fixed matrices","eigenvectors","receiving side correlation matrices","transmitting side correlation matrices","coupling matrix","lognormal distributions","uniform distributions","complex Gaussian random matrix","5G systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["massive MIMO","5G","channel matrix","capacity","singular value spread"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752523/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Measurement and empirical modeling of massive MIMO channel matrix in real indoor environment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752523/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16488335","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement and empirical modeling of massive MIMO channel matrix in real indoor environment","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570297111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.164887S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7752527,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Qiao","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37085764120"},{"name":"Weiqiang Tan","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Weiqiang","lastName":"Tan","id":"37085376755"},{"name":"Yuyan Zhao","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yuyan","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086205786"},{"name":"Chao-Kai Wen","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chao-Kai","lastName":"Wen","id":"37280263500"},{"name":"Shi Jin","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shi","lastName":"Jin","id":"37290425400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752527","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":815},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Quantization (signal)","Detectors","Additives","Uplink","Receivers","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","antenna arrays","MIMO communication","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive MIMO zero-forcing receiver","ADC","uplink spectral efficiency","approximate analytical expression","massive multi-input multi-output systems","MIMO systems","finite precision analog-digital converters","zeroforcing technique","receivers","additive quantization noise model","additive noise","independent noise","BS antennas"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the achievable uplink spectral efficiency (SE) and its approximate analytical expression in massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, using finite precision analog-digital converters (ADCs) and zeroforcing (ZF) technique at the receivers.

Aimed at getting the tradeoff between error performance and algorithm complexity, a practical CRCs-ADSCL(Adaptive SCL) decoding scheme is proposed for systematic polar codes, in which CRC values will be held by the bit-pair arrays in the decoding stage. This algorithm reduces the decoding latency and algorithmic complexity with little degradation in error performance.

To prevent eavesdropping in a multiple-input single-output (MISO) system, a physical layer security scheme called secure unitary coded spatial modulation (UC-SM) is proposed in this paper. The proposed secure UC-SM scheme can achieve a second-order transmit diversity by using a single radio frequency (RF) chain. Artificial noise (AN) is introduced to deteriorate the performance of eavesdropper while the desired node is not affected.

To ensure the stable wireless propagation, various linear adaptive channel estimation algorithms, e.g., recursive least square (RLS) and least mean square (LMS), have been developed. However, the traditional algorithms are unable to exploit the channel sparsity. Supporting by the compressive sensing (CS) theory, channel estimation performance can be further improved by taking advantage of the sparsity. In this paper, RLS based fast adaptive sparse channel estimation algorithm is proposed by introducing two sparse constraint functions, L1-norm and L0-norm. To improve the flexibility of the proposed algorithms, this paper introduces a regularization parameter selection method to adaptively exploit the channel sparsity. Finally, Monte Carlo based computer simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms based robust channel estimation either for sparse or non-sparse channel.","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752535.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Who care for channel sparsity?

Furthermore, the performance of BD-VP in diversity is comparable because the maximum likehood (ML) method is involved. However, in order to overcome the shortcoming that multiuser interference (MUI) will be suppressed completely by BD-VP becauce it do not considering the noise, generalized MMSE channel inversion VP (GMI-VP) algorithms are proposed, which much superior to BD-VP algorithm. When increasing the number of users, sphere decoding's complexity used in VP increases with exponential trend and limit VP's practical application. In this paper, low-complexity BD/GMI-VP precoding algorithms using lattice reduction (LR-BD/GMI-VP) are proposed.

OFDM. It can provide high data rate links and maintain a low PAPR to reduce the distortion caused by the nonlinear power amplifier. Thus, the quasi-constant envelope OFDM is suitable for satellite communication system. However, the carrier frequency offset (CFO) in satellite communication must be estimated and compensated before the demodulation. In this paper a CFO estimation scheme is proposed for quasi-constant envelope OFDM satellite system under additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Since the null subcarrier at the transmitter can be considered as the prior information at the receiver, this null subcarrier can be used to estimate the CFO through phase demodulator and inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) module at the receiver. Mathematical analysis reveals that the ideal estimation range of normalized CFO is nearly half of the size of IDFT under AWGN channel. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme performs well at moderate and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752538","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752538.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Carrier frequency offset estimation scheme for quasi-constant envelope OFDM satellite system under AWGN channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752538","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752538/","displayDocTitle":"Carrier frequency offset estimation scheme for quasi-constant envelope OFDM satellite system under AWGN channel","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497581","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752538/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Carrier frequency offset estimation scheme for quasi-constant envelope OFDM satellite system under AWGN channel","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570298738.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056929S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7752541,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoqing Pan","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, P.

ultra-dense small cell networks are emerging to deal with exponential data traffic increasing. With the deployment of small cells (SCs) becoming increasingly dense, these cells may be under-utilized during quite a few period of time. Depending on this circumstance, we aim to maximize the network energy efficiency by deactivating such under-utilized cells, subjecting to the rate fairness constraints among users. To overcome this issue, we propose an energy efficient SCs on/off approach that allows SCs to activate or deactivate based on estimated traffic load and UEs' preference requirements. Small cells are coupled into clustered based on distance firstly, and then UE-preference aware network selection scheme is performed, after which the SCs on/off pattern is derived iteratively in each formed cluster. For the network selection scheme, the optimal user association is obtained according to the SINR, estimated traffic load, traffic type and delay. Due to the complexity of finding the optimal SCs on/off pattern, we also give a practical suboptimal greedy SCs on/off algorithm with polynomial computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that energy expenditure can be reduced by 72% at most. Comparing to optimal search and traditional algorithms, the greedy algorithm achieves a comparable performance with much lower complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752551/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16497640","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7752551/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic small cell on/off control for green ultra-dense networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic small cell on/off control for green ultra-dense networks","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570300234.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052388S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7752555,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Zhang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086211048"},{"name":"Guoru Ding","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Guoru","lastName":"Ding","id":"37586009000"},{"name":"Yitao Xu","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yitao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37066215900"},{"name":"Fei Song","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Song","id":"37889622700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752555","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":198},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Predictive models","Throughput","Hidden Markov models","Data communication","Analytical models","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probability","radio spectrum management","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum prediction","dynamic spectrum access","spectrum sensing","sensing-plus-prediction based DSA model","secondary user throughput","SPP DSA model","SS-based DSA model","identical target detection probability","primary user"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752555","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752555","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","abstract":"Spectrum prediction, as one enabling technique for dynamic spectrum access (DSA), has recently been received ever-increasing research attention. Most related studies (explicitly or implicitly) assume that spectrum prediction is useful for DSA. However, it does't fundamentally clear when spectrum prediction is really beneficial. To address this issue, this paper firstly provides a high-level review of the existing spectrum sensing (SS) based DSA model and then proposes a sensing-plus-prediction (SPP) based DSA model to reap the benefits of both spectrum sensing and spectrum prediction. Theoretical condition on the usefulness of spectrum prediction for DSA is formally obtained in the form of Theorem.

Then, in an effort to further improve the security performance, we also propose an artificial noise (AN)-aided secure OFDM system associated with the transmit filter-aided approach. AN is generated in the null space of the legitimate channel by making use of residual power after power allocation for subcarriers. Therefore, AN can only disrupt eavesdropper's receptions but not affect legitimate receiver.

Wireless multicasting in the form of beamforming is regarded as an effective way to exploit the broadcast nature of wireless transmission to boost network throughput and ensure Quality of Service (QoS). However, the associated max-min fair (MMF) multicast beamforming design is a difficult constrained optimization problem, due to its non-smoothness and nonconvexity. Existing solutions for this NP-hard problem are not fairly satisfactory for online implementation in terms of performance-complexity trade-offs. This paper proposes a proximal gradient (PG) algorithm based on a kind of differential surrogate for the original nonsmooth objective. For better convergence rate, a fast proximal gradient (FPG) algorithm is also proposed, which guarantees convergence and offers state-of-the-art performance at low complexity. In each iteration, the FPG algorithm updates the solution along the gradient direction of the surrogate objective at a particular proximal point of the previous iteration and projects it back to the constraint set. Convergence of the PG/FPG iterates to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the surrogate problem is established. Simulation results show that the FPG algorithm outperforms the existing SDP/SOCP-based methods and gradient-based iterative methods in terms of minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and computational time.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752570","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752570.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752570","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast proximal gradient algorithm for single-group multicast beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752570","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Fast proximal gradient algorithm for single-group multicast beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752570/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752570/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497610","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast proximal gradient algorithm for single-group multicast beamforming","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570302720.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077157S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752570","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7752573,"authors":[{"name":"Siming Peng","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Siming","lastName":"Peng","id":"37085623933"},{"name":"Aijun Liu","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Aijun","lastName":"Liu","id":"38183373700"},{"name":"Xiaofei Pan","affiliation":["Satellite Communications and Navigation, Universities Collaborative Innovation Center in Jiangsu Province, Nanjing, China","College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofei","lastName":"Pan","id":"37085611581"},{"name":"Xiaohu Liang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohu","lastName":"Liang","id":"37085630118"},{"name":"Ke Wang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085798186"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752573","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":289},"abstract":"Due to the inherent intersymbol interference (ISI), the detection for faster-than-Nyquisy (FTN) signaling is long considered to be a challenging problem.

Although with optimal bit-error-rate (BER) performance, however, it is at the price of greatly increased computational complexity.

For joint Gaussian sources, we prove that extracting Wyner's common randomness is equivalent to lossy compression for a single Gaussian source, which implies that it can be extracted by a polar lattice for quantization.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752581","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752581.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extracting Wyner's common randomness using polar codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752581/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Extracting Wyner's common randomness using polar codes","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752581/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497690","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extracting Wyner's common randomness using polar codes","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570303707.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102546S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7752582,"authors":[{"name":"Qianxian Bao","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering"],"firstName":"Qianxian","lastName":"Bao","id":"37086113044"},{"name":"Hairong Wang","affiliation":["College of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hairong","lastName":"Wang","id":"38182246900"},{"name":"Yuanyuan Chen","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering"],"firstName":"Yuanyuan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086114450"},{"name":"Chen Liu","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280621800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752582","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":404},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aging","MIMO","Downlink","Channel estimation","Lead","Fading channels","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","energy conservation","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","power consumption","precoding","radio links","telecommunication power management","transmitting antennas","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink sum-rate","energy efficiency","massive MIMO systems","massive multiple-input multiple-output systems","channel aging effect","closed-form expression","zero-forcing precoder","ZF precoder","base station","power-scaling law","BS antennas","transmit power reduction","power consumption model","Monte Carlo simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","Channel Aging","ZF Precoder","Sum-Rate","Energy Efficiency"]}],"abstract":"This paper studies the downlink sum-rate and energy efficiency (EE) of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems under the effect of channel aging caused by the movements of users.

We aim at maximizing the total cognitive system throughput subject to the interference power constraint at the Primary Receiver (PR), the total transmission power constraint at the Secondary Base Station (SBS), and the Quality of Service (QoS) requirement for each SU in terms of the data rate and Bit Error Rate (BER). This joint resource allocation problem integrates subcarrier assignment, power allocation, bit loading, and interference management, and can be formulated as a Binary Linear Programming (BLP) framework. Although the Branch and Bound (BnB) algorithm is a general approach to obtain the optimal solution for a BLP problem, it is impractical in this joint resource allocation problem due to the high computational complexity. In order to provide a good balance between performance and computational complexity, a Novel Two-Step based (NTS) algorithm is proposed in this paper. Numerical results show that the NTS algorithm can reduce the computational complexity significantly with only marginal performance degradation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International

In the designed transmission scheme, the transmitter first exploits the knowledge of legitimate channel state information (CSI) to redefine the transmit antennas' indices which are used to map into spatial bits, then selects one activated antenna based on the renaming rule to transmit the modulation symbol. The communications security can be improved because the eavesdropper cannot detect the spatial bits information without the perfect legal CSI. Our studies derive the secrecy mutual information of the presented method. The numerical results on secrecy mutual information and bit error rate (BER) demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed secrecy communications scheme.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752590","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752590.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752590","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial modulation aided physical layer security enhancement for fading wiretap channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752590","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Spatial modulation aided physical layer security enhancement for fading wiretap channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752590/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16497723","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752590/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial modulation aided physical layer security enhancement for fading wiretap channels","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570304011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071928S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752590","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7752591,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Luo","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Luo","id":"37086037759"},{"name":"Qin Huang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qin","lastName":"Huang","id":"37405852800"},{"name":"Shuai Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shuai","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086031493"},{"name":"Zulin Wang","affiliation":["Collaborative Innovation Center of Geospatial Technology, Wuhan, China","School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zulin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404933700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752591","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":298},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752591","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Noise measurement","Error correction codes","Parity check codes","Dictionaries","Redundancy","Error probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","iterative decoding","learning (artificial intelligence)","source coding","text detection","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative turbo decoding","ECC decoders","Trie","English text","machine learning","source codes","content redundancy","communication systems","content recognition","error control coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["content recognition","machine learning","Trie","Turbo principle","LDPC code"]}],"abstract":"In modern communication systems, there is content redundancy inside the transmitted data no matter what source codes are adopted.

As a class of powerful error correction codes, Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes ha,ve been shown superior performance on AWGN channels. In addition, belief propagation (BP) decoding algorithm of LDPC codes based on scheduling strategy has better performance and faster convergence rate than conventional BP decoding algorithm. In this paper, a dynamic scheduling of LDPC codes is first used on impulsive noise channels. Moreover, we propose a new scheduling strategy which named grouping dynamic scheduling (GDS) for impulsive noise channels to further improve the performance. Simulation results show that the dynamic scheduling on impulsive noise channels provides more performance gain than AWGN channels and the gain becomes significant when the channel is more impulsive. In addition, compared with conventional dynamic scheduling strategy, our proposed algorithm not only provides better performance, but also lowers the actual decoding computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752594","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752594.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752594","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grouping dynamic scheduling for LDPC codes in symmetric alpha-stable impulsive noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752594","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Grouping dynamic scheduling for LDPC codes in symmetric alpha-stable impulsive noise","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752594/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497619","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7752594/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grouping dynamic scheduling for LDPC codes in symmetric alpha-stable impulsive noise","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570304169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050556S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752594","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7752595,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Lai","affiliation":["Communication engineering department, National university of defense technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Lai","id":"37086173982"},{"name":"Erbao Li","affiliation":["Communication engineering department, National university of defense technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Erbao","lastName":"Li","id":"38238699200"},{"name":"Jing Lei","affiliation":["Communication engineering department, National university of defense technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Lei","id":"37652895400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752595","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":250},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Reliability","Parity check codes","Galois fields","Decoding","Encoding","Buildings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","decoding","optimisation","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["threshold based extended minimum-sum algorithm","nonbinary LDPC codes","decoding complexity reduction","extended min-sum","trellis based EMS","trellis representation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Extended Min-Sum","threshold","non-binary LDPC code","trellis representation","delta domain message"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Threshold-based extended minimum-sum algorithm for non-binary LDPC codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752595","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752595","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752595.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new improved algorithm to reduce the decoding complexity of NB-LDPC codes especially when the number of iteration is large.

Furthermore, our DR demapper avoids the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752607/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7752607/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497542","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A low-complexity soft demapper for 128APSK of DVB-S2X","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-complexity soft demapper for 128APSK of DVB-S2X","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570304294.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055766S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752607","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7752610,"authors":[{"name":"Yulong Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shannxi, China"],"firstName":"Yulong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086032898"},{"name":"Xiaohui Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shannxi, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohui","lastName":"Li","id":"37836093300"},{"name":"Feng-Kui Gong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shannxi, China"],"firstName":"Feng-Kui","lastName":"Gong","id":"37272503600"},{"name":"Yingchao Lin","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shannxi, China"],"firstName":"Yingchao","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086034500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752610","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":327},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Antennas","Radio frequency","MIMO","Precoding","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","iterative methods","MIMO communication","radio transceivers","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive multiple-input multiple-output systems","massive MIMO system","channel reciprocity","time division duplex mode","TDD reciprocity compensation","downlink channel state information","CSI","transceiver radio frequency chains","RF chains","massive MIMO approximation theory","iterative calibration method","channel calibration"]}],"abstract":"Channel reciprocity is a key characteristic in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in time division duplex (TDD) mode, by which the downlink channel state information (CSI) can be obtained easily.

The near-filed SAR imaging system usually collects multi-frequency sparse data, where each frequency data can be represented as a hierarchical tree structure under a wavelet basis and different frequency data can be modeled as a joint structure because it's highly correlated. A new multi-frequency CS model, by integrating the tree-sparsity and joint-sparsity together, is proposed to exploit the structural dependencies of the multi-frequency SAR sparse data. In order to solve the corresponding constrained minimization problem, a multi-frequency CS approach is introduced by using a splitting Bregman update with a variation of the parallel Fista-like proximal algorithm. A corrosion-under-paint example demonstrates that the proposed multi-frequency CS model outperforms the conventional model, and the new multi-frequency CS approach enables us to further reduce the number of measurements required to stably recover SAR images of targets and better differentiate true SAR images from recovery artifacts.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference

In this paper, a novel SCMA codebook design scheme is proposed to maximize the sum rate, where we transfer the design of multi-dimensional constellation sets to the optimizing of series of 1-dimensional complex codewords. Specifically, a basic M-order pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) is optimized and then the angles of rotation between the input 1-dimensional constellation and the basic M-PAM constellation can be obtained within a feasible calculation complexity to improve the sum-rate. Finally, the series of 1-dimensional complex codewords are combined to construct multi-dimensional codebooks based on Latin square criterion. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed codebook outperforms the existing codebook by 1.3 dB over AWGN channel and 1.1 dB over Rayleigh channel in terms of bit error rate (BER) performance.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752620","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752620.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A capacity-based codebook design method for sparse code multiple access systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A capacity-based codebook design method for sparse code multiple access systems","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752620/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497623","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752620/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A capacity-based codebook design method for sparse code multiple access systems","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570304546.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094356S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752620","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7752623,"authors":[{"name":"Haijing Zhong","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Haijing","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37086198507"},{"name":"Shancheng Zhao","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shancheng","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38241136100"},{"name":"Li Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Chen","id":"37292791800"},{"name":"Xiao Ma","affiliation":["School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Ma","id":"37279526900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752623","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":202},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752623","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Bit error rate","Decoding","Matrix decomposition","Standards","Sun","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic codes","decoding","error statistics","Hamming codes","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding latency","codeword length","BER","bit error rate","IEEE 802.22 standard","Tanner graph","HM-QC-LDPC code","Hamming codeword","quasicyclic low-density parity-check code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["QC-LDPC codes","short codes","Hamming codes"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new approach to construct quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes using Hamming codewords of weight three, namely the HM-QC-LDPC codes.

These all call for an increased reliability and stability on cellular networks, especially internet service in cellular networks. In this paper, we propose a new anomaly detection method for periodic network parameters. We use aggregation, including threshold aggregation (TA) and spatial aggregation, to enhance the periodicity of parameters. TA can smooth the small fluctuation when a parameter is in valley and improve the accuracy of anomaly detection. Spatial aggregation uses an unsupervised way which is widely applied in Big Data Analysis to cluster similar base stations (BSs). In each cluster, the periodicity of parameters is highlighted. Our experiments, which are based on real data from current cellular networks, show that, compared with the detection in equal time bins (e.g., hourly aggregation) and settled space (e.g., BS), our aggregation method improves the detection results efficiently.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing

By transmitting the identical pilot signal as that of the legitimate user, the pilot spoofing attack can degrade legitimate transmission and, more severely, facilitate eavesdropping. This paper considers the problem of detecting pilot spoofing attack for a typical multi-input single-output (MISO) wiretap system. We slightly modify the conventional training mechanism and divide the procedure into pilot phase and random phase. By examining the difference of estimated legitimate channels during these two phases, a novel random-training-aided (RTA) detection algorithm is proposed to identify the existence of the pilot spoofing attack. Extensive simulation results illustrate that our proposed RTA scheme can achieve accurate pilot spoofing detection.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752629.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random-training-aided pilot spoofing detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752629/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7752629/","displayDocTitle":"Random-training-aided pilot spoofing detection","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497681","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random-training-aided pilot spoofing detection","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570304756.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064648S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752629","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7752630,"authors":[{"name":"Chunli Wang","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, CHINA"],"firstName":"Chunli","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086211572"},{"name":"Xiaofu Wu","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, CHINA"],"firstName":"Xiaofu","lastName":"Wu","id":"37293518500"},{"name":"Wei-Ping Zhu","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, CHINA"],"firstName":"Wei-Ping","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37275886700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752630","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":201},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752630","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Iterative decoding","Reliability","Complexity theory","Quantization (signal)","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-normalized weighted bit-flipping decoding algorithm","SNWBF decoding algorithm","low-density parity-check codes","LDPC codes","neighboring check nodes","improved modified-weighted-bit-flipping","IMWBF algorithm","multiplicative normalization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["bit-flipping (BF) decoding","low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","quantification"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A self-normalized weighted bit-flipping decoding algorithm for LDPC codes","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752630.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752630","abstract":"A novel self-normalized weighted bit-flipping (SNWBF) decoding algorithm for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is proposed.

An iterative algorithm is employed to jointly eliminate inter-carrier interference (ICI) and inter-symbol interference (ISI). Specifically, ICI is cancelled using a parallel iterative channel estimation method, which, based on first order least squares channel estimation, employs no inverse matrix calculations, resulting in low computational complexity. Residual ISI cancellation is employed to improve the detection of interfering symbol, which achieves effective reconstruction and cancellation of IS I with relatively low computational complexity. The results of simulation suggest that the proposed channel estimation scheme effectively eliminates ICI and ISI. In addition, the required number of iterations and algorithm complexity are discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing

By dynamically allocating the numbers of UL and DL remote radio heads (RRHs), BDN facilitates simultaneous UL and DL communications to accommodate the data traffic asymmetry. Assuming that the number of antennas at each RRH (M) is large, we derive the closed-form expressions for the ergodic achievable rates in BDN systems, and the theoretical results are shown to be accurate compared with the Monte Carlo simulation results. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of the limiting UL and DL rates when M goes to infinity, and it indicates that we can scale down the UL and DL power per user proportionally to 1/M to guarantee a certain UL or DL quality of service in BDN. Numerical results indicate that there exists an optimal ratio between UL and DL RRH numbers for the maximal spectral efficiency in BDN. Thanks to our proposed RRH layout which guarantees the uniformity and symmetry in the whole network, we can find the optimal ratio between UL and DL RRH numbers more easily.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752635","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752635.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bidirectional dynamic network for asymmetry traffic with massive MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752635","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bidirectional dynamic network for asymmetry traffic with massive MIMO","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752635/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497770","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7752635/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bidirectional dynamic network for asymmetry traffic with massive MIMO","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570304885.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063172S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752635","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7752638,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Peng","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Peng","id":"37085755464"},{"name":"Rongke Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rongke","lastName":"Liu","id":"37289647500"},{"name":"Yi Hou","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Hou","id":"37085539861"},{"name":"Ling Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085520701"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752638","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":274},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752638","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Measurement","Viterbi algorithm","Convolutional codes","Graphics processing units","Instruction sets","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codecs","convolutional codes","graphics processing units","parallel architectures","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel block-based Viterbi decoder","convolutional codes","GPU","graphic processing unit platform","decoding procedure","compute unified device architecture","CUDA","decoding phase","data structures","internal memory transactions","NVIDIA GTX580","GTX980","bit rate 598 Mbit/s","bit rate 1802 Mbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CUDA","convolutional codes","Viterbi algorithm","parallel decoding","SDR"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a parallel block-based Viterbi decoder (PBVD) on the graphic processing unit (GPU) platform for the decoding of convolutional codes.

However, current analysis and design only focus on the system state at a certain time, neglecting the temporal-spatial fluctuation of traffic and the content popularity variations, which are often affected by users' behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel social-aware cache information processing approach, where the social-tie factor (STF) is modelled on the basis of the data collected from practical cellular networks. Limited caching capacity is deployed in a few selected very important base stations (VIBSs), which have higher average STF values. Normal SCs are linked to VIBSs with limited microwave fronthaul. By adopting the stochastic geometry process, key performance indicators, e. g., throughput, delay, energy efficiency (EE), are all derived as functions of transmission power, cache ability, file popularity, density of SCs and users. Numerical results show that the throughput of the proposed social-aware caching method is nearly 250% larger than heterogeneous network (HetNet) with no cache and 48% larger than the homogeneous cache, by better utilizing STF. The number of selected VIBSs can be optimized to maximize the network throughput and EE under the constraint of cache and backhaul capacity.

In this paper, we jointly consider power allocation (PA) and subcarrier pairing (SP) in a relaying system in which a source node sends OFDM signals to a destination node with the help of a full-duplex (FD) relay node. Under individual power constraints at both the source node and the relay node, we seek to maximize the end-to-end data rate of the relay link by performing PA across subcarriers in the two hops. Furthermore, SP is employed to re-associate subcarriers between the incoming link and the outgoing link at the relay to further improve system performance. Specifically, the coupling of different subproblems makes the problem rather complicated. Thus, we propose a novel iterative method together with the dual method to solve this joint PA and SP problem, which is verified by simulations to be able to converge in a small number of iterations. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly enhance the system performance when compared to conventional methods; particularly, PA can provide significant benefit in the case of high self-interference. In addition, when the relay self-interference is high, with the proposed joint PA and SP method, FD operation at the relay can reduce to half-duplex (HD) mode from the frequency domain perspective, where the relay only receives over a portion of subcarriers and transmits over the rest subcarriers to avoid excessive self-interference.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint power allocation and subcarrier pairing for dual-hop OFDM links with full-duplex relaying","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752648","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752648.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752648","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752648","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752648/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Joint power allocation and subcarrier pairing for dual-hop OFDM links with full-duplex relaying","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752648/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16488351","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint power allocation and subcarrier pairing for dual-hop OFDM links with full-duplex relaying","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570305010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09101S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752648","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7752649,"authors":[{"name":"Shuang Yang","affiliation":["No.75770 Unit of PLA, Guangzhou, China","College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shuang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085428530"},{"name":"Yueming Cai","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yueming","lastName":"Cai","id":"37290653400"},{"name":"Wendong Yang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China","Ministry of Education, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wendong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37290576900"},{"name":"Tao Zhang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37592504100"},{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37539333300"},{"name":"Xing Tan","affiliation":["No.78088 Unit of PLA, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Xing","lastName":"Tan","id":"37086207794"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752649","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","OFDM","Buffer storage","Energy efficiency","Wireless communication","Signal to noise ratio","Broadband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","OFDM modulation","protocols","relay networks (telecommunication)","subcarrier multiplexing","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer-aided max-sum relay selection","energy efficiency analysis","OFDM relay systems","outage performance","buffer-aided orthogonal frequency division multiplexing relay systems","amplify-and-forward protocol","orthogonal subcarriers","OFDM subcarriers","buffer-aided relays","stationary state probability","joint time-frequency subchannel pairing strategy","channel quality","time pairing","frequency pairing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy efficiency","subchannel pairing","relay selection","outage probability"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we analyze the energy efficiency (EE) and outage performance in buffer-aided orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) relay systems. All the relays adopt the amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol and the transmission from the source to destination on orthogonal subcarriers. We propose the max-sum relay selection scheme, which fully exploits the flexibility offered by both OFDM subcarriers and buffer-aided relays. The max-sum scheme always chooses the strongest available relay which dynamically switching between reception and transmission while.

Furthermore, the performance of the TPFP strategy is shown optimal compared with that of conventional no subchannel pairing systems.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752649","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752649.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752649","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Buffer-aided max-sum relay selection and energy efficiency analysis in OFDM relay systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752649","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Buffer-aided max-sum relay selection and energy efficiency analysis in OFDM relay systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752649/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497613","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7752649/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Buffer-aided max-sum relay selection and energy efficiency analysis in OFDM relay systems","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570305018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058207S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752649","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7752650,"authors":[{"name":"Shuo Ma","affiliation":["Information & Electronics Technology Lab, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing","Science and Technology on Information Transmission and Dissemination in Communication Networks Laboratory, Shijiazhuang","Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing"],"firstName":"Shuo","lastName":"Ma","id":"37086206928"},{"name":"Yizhou He","affiliation":["China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, Beijing"],"firstName":"Yizhou","lastName":"He","id":"37085537181"},{"name":"Gaofeng Cui","affiliation":["Information & Electronics Technology Lab, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing","Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing"],"firstName":"Gaofeng","lastName":"Cui","id":"38236122700"},{"name":"Weidong Wang","affiliation":["Information & Electronics Technology Lab, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing","Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing"],"firstName":"Weidong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085527184"},{"name":"Haila Wang","affiliation":["Information & Electronics Technology Lab, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing","Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing"],"firstName":"Haila","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086208258"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752650","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":290},"abstract":"Mobile Communication systems are affected apparently by the Doppler Frequency and Doppler Rate.

since it enables ubiquitous data exchange among devices without any artificial intervention. Cellular system is expected to play a significant role in successfully implementing the M2M communications for its ready-to-use infrastructure. However, there still exist many challenges, such as co-channel interferences to existing mobile users, congestions and limited battery capacity of M2M devices. In this paper, in order to realize M2M communication over cellular system, we propose a power- and spectrum-efficient massive-code-space-multiplex (massive-CSM) access scheme, in which quasi-orthogonal massive MIMO channels are utilized as resource blocks in the framework of SCMA. In the proposed scheme, group headers gather data from M2M devices by D2D links and communicate with eNB. Additionally, D2D-link power consumption optimization and transmit layers allocation algorithm are provided to minimize power consumption of codewords distribution among group headers. By applying random matrix theory, we also drive an uplink asymptotic equivalent (AE) of signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of the system as the number of eNB antennas approach infinity. Simulation results show that the proposed multiplex access scheme improves the uplink capacity several times than traditional scheme and our algorithm achieves better results with less time complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A group-based M2M multiple access scheme in massive MIMO MU-SCMA cellular networks","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752657","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752657.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752657","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752657/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A group-based M2M multiple access scheme in massive MIMO MU-SCMA cellular networks","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752657/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497545","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A group-based M2M multiple access scheme in massive MIMO MU-SCMA cellular networks","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570305132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066575S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7752674,"authors":[{"name":"Renzheng Cao","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Renzheng","lastName":"Cao","id":"38577185500"},{"name":"Xiaofei Zhang","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279338600"},{"name":"Feifei Gao","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Feifei","lastName":"Gao","id":"37289304900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752674","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Direction-of-arrival estimation","Complexity theory","Manifolds","Arrays","Electronic mail","Covariance matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["propagator-based algorithm","coherently distributed source localization","direction finding","uniform linear array","DSPE algorithm","CD sources","nominal DOA","angular spreads","linear operator","decoupled one-dimensional spectrum estimator","rank reduction criterion","high-complexity two-dimensional search","eigen-decomposition operation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752674","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752674.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Propagator-based algorithm for localization of coherently distributed sources","abstract":"In this work, the direction finding of coherently distributed (CD) sources using a uniform linear array (ULA) is investigated. Conventional DSPE algorithm for localization of CD sources requires an extensive two-dimensional search of nominal DOAs and angular spreads. The proposed algorithm exploits the propagator, which is a linear operator that can be easily estimated from the received data, to identify the subspace. Then it constructs a decoupled one-dimensional spectrum estimator for nominal DOAs with the aid of the characteristic of ULA and the rank reduction criterion. The proposed algorithm can dispense the high-complexity two-dimensional search and the eigen-decomposition operation. Hence, it exhibits an advantage of low complexity. When compared to the DSPE and CD-GESPRIT algorithms, the proposed algorithm has close estimation accuracy. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the performance and improvement of the proposed algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752674/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7752674/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497706","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Propagator-based algorithm for localization of coherently distributed sources","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Propagator-based algorithm for localization of coherently distributed sources","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570305303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065696S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7752675,"authors":[{"name":"Youzhi Xiong","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, ChengDu, China"],"firstName":"Youzhi","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37086015696"},{"name":"Ning Wei","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, ChengDu, China"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Wei","id":"37866546600"},{"name":"Zhongpei Zhang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, ChengDu, China"],"firstName":"Zhongpei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086007683"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752675","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":185},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","MIMO","Estimation","Channel estimation","Antennas","Receivers","Uplink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IQI compensation","uplink quantized massive MIMO systems","quadrature-phase imbalance compensation","in-phase imbalance compensation","joint estimation and compensation","JEC","separated estimation and compensation","SEC","channel estimation","achievable sum rate","quantization bits"]}],"abstract":"In this study, two techniques for compensating in-phase/quadrature-phase imbalance (IQI), which are joint estimation and compensation (JEC) and separated estimation and compensation (SEC), have been investigated in the uplink quantized massive MIMO systems.

Multicast beamforming can further boost the system performance by utilizing channel state information (CSI) at the base station (BS) equipped with multiple antennas. This paper provides a validation of multicast beamforming over actual channels measured in the Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) campus wireless network, a FDD LTE network. We first build a receiver prototype using USRP N210 and LabVIEW for channel measurement. A single base station with 4 antennas and 3 single-antenna receivers are considered. Based on the measured actual CSI, we then evaluate the performance of multicast beamforming under the quality of service (QoS) problem formulation, which is to minimize the transmit power consumption subject to an individual Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) constraint for each user receiver. The Semi-Definite Relaxation (SDR) approach is adopted to find an solution close to primitive solution. Experimental results demonstrate that multicast transmission using a single beamformer provides significant power gain over unicast transmission with multiple beamformers under the same QoS constraints in our considered campus network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752680/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16497685","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752680/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Channel measurement and performance of multicast beamforming in campus network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel measurement and performance of multicast beamforming in campus network","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570305355.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052067S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7752683,"authors":[{"name":"Hongzhen Cheng","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hongzhen","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37086207849"},{"name":"Fan Chen","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086209622"},{"name":"Nan Liu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37278122800"},{"name":"Zhiwen Pan","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiwen","lastName":"Pan","id":"37278873800"},{"name":"Xiaohu You","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohu","lastName":"You","id":"37276505600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752683","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Quality of service","Interference","Algorithm design and analysis","Optimization","Downlink","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","integer programming","nonlinear programming","OFDM modulation","resource allocation","telecommunication power management","telecommunication scheduling","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink heterogeneous OFDMA networks","traffic","utility-based energy-efficient resource allocation algorithm","HetNets","mixed integer nonlinear programming","resource block scheduling","power allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["utility function","energy-efficient","resource allocation","HetNet","OFDMA"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we proposed a utility-based energy-efficient (UEE) resource allocation algorithm in downlink OFDMA heterogeneous networks (HetNets) with mixed traffic.

Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can achieve better user fairness and user satisfaction than existing schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Utility-based energy-efficient resource allocation in downlink heterogeneous OFDMA networks with mixed traffic","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752683","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752683.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752683","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752683/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Utility-based energy-efficient resource allocation in downlink heterogeneous OFDMA networks with mixed traffic","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752683/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497755","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utility-based energy-efficient resource allocation in downlink heterogeneous OFDMA networks with mixed traffic","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570305398.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055063S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7752689,"authors":[{"name":"Mengyun Ying","affiliation":["School of Communications Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Mengyun","lastName":"Ying","id":"37086076262"},{"name":"Haiquan Wang","affiliation":["School of Communications Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Haiquan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280092800"},{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales, Australia"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37278432600"},{"name":"Jianmin Lu","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd, China"],"firstName":"Jianmin","lastName":"Lu","id":"37086199574"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752689","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Encoding","Contamination","Complexity theory","Channel estimation","Maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","communication complexity","decoding","MIMO communication","space-time block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot contamination alleviated coding","pilot contamination alleviated decoding","multicell massive MIMO systems","space-time block coding","multicell massive multiple-input multiple-output systems","code design criterion","code design","decoding complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","Pilot reuse","Coding","Decoding","Space-time block codes"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new space-time block coding scheme to mitigate the effect of pilot contamination in multi-cell, massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems.

We formulate the power allocation between multiple detected idle spectrum bands with the consideration of mutual interference between the primary user (PU) and SU which is referred to as multi-band power allocation (MBPA). We prove that the formulated MBPA problem is convex and consider the use of sequential unconstrained minimization technique (SUMT) interior point method for solving the formulated problem.

However, excessive density increment leads to decay of reliability of MLC NAND flash memory, thus an appropriate error correction code (ECC) is required to address this issue. This paper presents an efficient multi-strategy ECC scheme called pre-check scheme which consists of hard, quantized-soft, and pure-soft decoders geared to MLC NAND flash memory based on polar code proposed by E. Arikan to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks with better performance and lower complexity. The hard decoder is designed to correct the majority of erroneous codewords in the initial phase of the flash memory, while the soft decoders aim to correct codewords which contain larger amount of errors. In addition, we clarify that the mapping scheme using Gray code can achieve best performance compared to other alternatives.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Error correction codes","Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Standards","Sensors","Reflective binary codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","flash memories","Gray codes","NAND circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polar code-based error correction code scheme","NAND flash memory applications","multilevel per cell NAND flash memory","storage capacity","multistrategy ECC scheme","pre-check scheme","quantized-soft decoder","pure-soft decoder","Gray code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Polar codes","solid state drive (SSD)","error correction code (ECC)","NAND flash memory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752700","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752700","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752700.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752700","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polar code-based error correction code scheme for NAND flash memory applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Polar code-based error correction code scheme for NAND flash memory applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752700/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752700/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497600","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polar code-based error correction code scheme for NAND flash memory applications","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570305541.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044826S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752700","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":7752701,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Liu","affiliation":["College of IOT Engineering, Hohai University, Changzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086207447"},{"name":"Aimin Jiang","affiliation":["College of IOT Engineering, Hohai University, Changzhou, China"],"firstName":"Aimin","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37300071500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752701","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"abstract":"In this paper, a novel common sub-expression elimination (CSE) method is presented for the design of linear phase finite impulse response (FIR) filters with low hardware cost.

Three-dimensional (3D) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems have drawn more and more attention as they meet the increasing date-rate demands in 5G mobile networks. However, in the practical system, the large overhead of the channel state information-reference signal (CSI-RS) would become a barrier for performance improvement of 3D MIMO system with the significantly increased number of transmit antennas. What's more, it will be inefficient for performance promotion that the antenna elements (AEs) in one column are usually virtualized as one antenna port to support one date stream in the vertical direction in existing 3D MIMO. To overcome these problems, on the one hand, this paper proposes linked precoding, combining separate elevation CSI-RS configuration and CSI-RS precoded with elevation beamforming vector to make a better tradeoff between resource overhead and throughput performance, and on the other hand, multi-stream precoding based on CSI-RS is also proposed to provide larger throughput performance supporting multi-stream precoding not only in horizontal direction but also in vertical direction.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752705","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752705.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limited feedback precoding based on CSI-RS for 3D MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752705","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752705/","displayDocTitle":"Limited feedback precoding based on CSI-RS for 3D MIMO systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497637","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752705/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limited feedback precoding based on CSI-RS for 3D MIMO systems","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570305600.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042279S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752705","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7752706,"authors":[{"name":"Huan Hao","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Huan","lastName":"Hao","id":"37085669494"},{"name":"Huali Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Huali","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085497732"},{"name":"Liang Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085827035"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752706","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Atmospheric modeling","Atmospheric waves","Noise reduction","Atmospheric measurements","Wavelet transforms","Time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","adaptive signal detection","atmospherics","feature extraction","interference suppression","radiowave propagation","signal denoising","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric noise suppression method","synchrosqueezed wavelet transform","SST method","low frequency radio wave","long-range propagation","earth-ionosphere waveguide","signal of interest","adaptive soft limiter","time-frequency filtering","wavelet denoising method","qualitative analysis","quantitative analysis"]}],"abstract":"Low frequency radio wave has efficient long-range propagation in the so-called earth-ionosphere waveguide and it is widely used in communication and navigation.

Replacing RSS with channel state information (CSI) is proven to be an efficient method. However, not all CSI raw data contribute equally to the localization performance. The computational cost of fingerprint database is unacceptable as well. In this paper, we propose a novel method of Wi-Fi indoor localization based on CSI. A fast orthogonal search (FOS) algorithm is utilized to calculate the weights of CSI raw data collected from the wireless network interface card (NIC), reducing the database at the same time. Different weights of the features are then used as the input of a back-propagation (BP) neural network, conducting weighted training. We implement the system and experimentally evaluate its performance in the typical laboratory scenario. The performance of the proposed system is compared with several existing systems. Result shows that the proposed system has a 13% improvement in accuracy and a 14% improvement in execute time.

However, accurate channel estimation technique poses a challenge for spatial correlated 3D MIMO systems. Based on the conventional general sparse channel model, sparse channel estimation method using compressive sampling matching pursuit (CoSaMP) algorithm cannot efficiently exploit the block-structure information in the 3D MIMO channel. To fully take advantage of the prior information, in this paper, we propose a block-partition compressive sampling matching pursuit (BP-CoSaMP) algorithm to exploit the block-structure sparsity in angular domain, so that it can further improve channel estimation performance. Simulation results imply that the proposed algorithm not only can reduce pilot overhead, but also can reduce compute complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752722.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752722","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752722","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block-partition sparse channel estimation for spatially correlated massive MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Channel estimation","Approximation algorithms","Sparse matrices","Signal processing algorithms","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","channel estimation","compressed sensing","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block-structure information","compressive sampling matching pursuit algorithm","sparse channel model","3D MIMO systems","channel estimation technique","5G wireless communication systems","fifth-generation wireless communication systems","multiple-input and multiple-output","block-partition sparse channel estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block-structure sparsity","compressive sensing","block-partition sparse channel estimation","spatially correlated massive MIMO system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752722/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Block-partition sparse channel estimation for spatially correlated massive MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752722/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16488327","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block-partition sparse channel estimation for spatially correlated massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570305868.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059217S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752722","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7752724,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Li","affiliation":["School of Communications Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Li","id":"37086199927"},{"name":"Haiquan Wang","affiliation":["School of Communications Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Haiquan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280092800"},{"name":"Mengyun Ying","affiliation":["School of Communications Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Mengyun","lastName":"Ying","id":"37086076262"},{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, Australia"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085498373"},{"name":"Jianmin Lu","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd"],"firstName":"Jianmin","lastName":"Lu","id":"37086199574"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752724","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":324},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Channel estimation","Estimation","Simulation","MIMO","Antennas","Contamination"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","mean square error methods","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive MIMO uplink systems","channel estimation method","first-order statistics","minimum mean square error","MMSE decoder","superimposed pilots method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-cell massive MIMO system","Channel estimation","Pilot contamination","Superimposed training","the first-order statistics"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a channel estimation method based on the superimposed pilots with the first-order statistics is proposed for massive MIMO systems.

Worse still, conventional NSE-based approaches are facing convergence problems in poor propagation environments. In this paper, we introduce an adjustable iterative detection algorithm based on NSE to solve the complexity and convergence problems. Furthermore, we propose an efficient approach to approximately compute the log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) with low-complexity.

Convolutions in CNNs generally dominate the overall computation complexity and thus consume major computational power in real implementations. In this paper, efficient hardware architectures incorporating parallel fast finite impulse response (FIR) algorithm (FFA) for CNN convolution implementations are discussed. The theoretical derivation of 3 and 5 parallel FFAs is presented and the corresponding 3 and 5 parallel fast convolution units (FCUs) are proposed for most commonly used 3 \u00d7 3 and 5 \u00d7 5 convolutional kernels in CNNs, respectively. Compared to conventional CNN convolution architectures, the proposed FCUs reduce the number of multiplications used in convolutions significantly. Additionally, the FCUs minimize the number of reads from the feature map memory. Furthermore, a reconfigurable FCU architecture which suits the convolutions of both 3 \u00d7 3 and 5 \u00d7 5 kernels is proposed. Based on this, an efficient top-level architecture for processing a complete convolutional layer in a CNN is developed. To quantize the benefits of the proposed FCUs, the design of an FCU is coded with RTL and synthesized with TSMC 90nm CMOS technology. The implementation results demonstrate that 30% and 36% of the computational energy can be saved compared to conventional solutions with 3 \u00d7 3 and 5 \u00d7 5 kernels in CNN, respectively.","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752726.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient convolution architectures for convolutional neural network","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752726","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752726","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752726/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Efficient convolution architectures for convolutional neural network","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16488376","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7752726/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient convolution architectures for convolutional neural network","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570305904.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043502S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":7752730,"authors":[{"name":"Jianfeng Sun","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Wireless-Optical Communications Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, P.

For enhancing physical layer security, we propose so-called optimal antenna selection (OAS) and suboptimal antenna selection (SAS) schemes, which assume that the instantaneous wiretap channel information is known and unknown, respectively. We carry out the secrecy outage probability analysis for the proposed OAS and SAS schemes. In order to make a performance comparison, we also discuss the secrecy outage probability of single-input-single-output cognitive radio (SISO-CR) system. The secrecy outage performance of SAS is better than SISO but worse than OAS. Furthermore, as the numbers of antennas of SU and SD increase, the secrecy outage probability of OAS and SAS both have significant improvements.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752737","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752737.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit antenna selection to improve physical layer security for MIMO-CR systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752737","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Transmit antenna selection to improve physical layer security for MIMO-CR systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752737/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497654","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7752737/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit antenna selection to improve physical layer security for MIMO-CR systems","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570306758.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056081S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7752741,"authors":[{"name":"Tingping Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Chongqing Jiaotong University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Tingping","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086211871"},{"name":"Guan Gui","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Chongqing Jiaotong University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Guan","lastName":"Gui","id":"37590883700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752741","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752741","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive estimation","channel estimation","convergence","least mean squares methods","next generation networks","numerical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence analysis","RL1-SLMS-based robust adaptive sparse channel estimation","next-generation wireless communications systems","re-weighted L1-norm penalized sign least mean square error algorithm","non-Gaussian impulsive noise environment","numerical simulations","non-Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convergence analysis","reweighted L1-norm function","sign least mean square error","robust channel estimation"]}],"abstract":"Robust adaptive sparse channel estimation problem has been attracted highly attention in the next-generation wireless communications systems.

The codebook-based beamforming is widely used to compensate the severe channel attenuation. However, the large size of codebook makes it difficult to directly search the optimal precoder and combiner in practice. In this paper, we consider a general setup which has no a priori information about the channel, and propose an iterative scheme to optimize the precoder and combiner jointly. The proposed scheme uses the warm start strategy to perform initialization. By treating each observation of spectrum efficiency as a random variable, the proposed scheme utilizes the alternate discrete stochastic optimization which uses probabilistic forecasting, to find the optimum with reduced computational complexity. Moreover, we prove the convergence of the discrete stochastic optimization in our scenario. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional algorithm in terms of higher spectrum efficiency and lower complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog beamforming for millimeter-wave MIMO systems via stochastic optimization","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","doi":"10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752743","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736509/7752440/07752743.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752743","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7752440","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752743","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752743/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Analog beamforming for millimeter-wave MIMO systems via stochastic optimization","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752743/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16497692","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog beamforming for millimeter-wave MIMO systems via stochastic optimization","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570306921.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055114S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752743","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7752745,"authors":[{"name":"Zhuwei Peng","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhuwei","lastName":"Peng","id":"37086204791"},{"name":"Chunxu Jiao","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chunxu","lastName":"Jiao","id":"37085711289"},{"name":"Zhihuan Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhihuan","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086202376"},{"name":"Zhaoyang Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhaoyang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279636300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752745","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":219},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel estimation","Wireless communication","Frequency-domain analysis","Doppler effect","Numerical models","Broadband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","OFDM modulation","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vector OFDM system","high mobility wireless communications","wireless propagation channel","frequency domain","time domain","doubly selective channel","channel state information","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing system","complex exponential basis expansion model","modified CE-BEM method","symbol spreading structure","modified CE-BEM channel model"]}],"abstract":"In high mobility wireless communications, the wireless propagation channel usually exhibits selectivity in both time and frequency domain, thus being referred to as doubly selective channel.

In this paper, an efficient resource allocation (RA) scheme is proposed for the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)-based mobile underlay CRN. Through location-awareness techniques, a realistic model based on predictable channel state information (CSI) is considered. According to the predicting result, the sum average effective capacity (EC) of the secondary network is calculated and aimed to be maximized through the RA scheme. Meanwhile the interference introduced to primary users (PUs) should be less than given thresholds, the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) requirements and the limit of total transmit power of secondary users (SUs) should be satisfied. A stepwise algorithm is introduced to solve the optimization RA at the cost of a low complexity, with four procedures including access control, initial power allocation, subchannel allocation and power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve not only higher total EC but also higher energy efficiency (EE) and spectrum efficiency (SE).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752746/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16497767","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752746/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Subchannel and power allocation for OFDMA-based mobile cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subchannel and power allocation for OFDMA-based mobile cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1570306989.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123584S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736509","isNumber":"7752440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736509","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7752440","articleId":"7752746","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7752749,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Yu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Global Energy Interconnection Research institute, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086198337"},{"name":"Xiaoting Yu","affiliation":["Key Lab of Broadband Wireless Communication and Sensor Network Technology (NUPT), Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoting","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086211496"},{"name":"Xiao Wu","affiliation":["Key Lab of Broadband Wireless Communication and Sensor Network Technology (NUPT), Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086208642"},{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Key Lab of Broadband Wireless Communication and Sensor Network Technology (NUPT), Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085890991"},{"name":"Baoyu Zheng","affiliation":["Key Lab of Broadband Wireless Communication and Sensor Network Technology (NUPT), Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Baoyu","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37272833700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2860-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2859-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2861-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"}],"articleNumber":"7752749","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","OFDM modulation","passive optical networks","queueing theory","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sleeping-time analysis","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","passive optical network","cognitive OFDM-PON","link speed","queue buffer capacity","energy efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognition","OFDM-PON","sleeping time","link speed","queue buffer capacity"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we introduce the concept of OFDM-PON, and introduce the best method to choose the maximum sleep time based on link speed and queue buffer capacity.

With imperfect channel state information (ICSI) taken into account, we study an NOMA-based downlink amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying network under Nakagami-m fading in this paper. First, we investigate the system outage behavior, and close-form expressions for the exact and tight lower bounds of the outage probability are attained, respectively. By further evaluating the outage probability at the high SNR region, it is observed that an error floor exists in the outage probability due to the presence of ICSI. Finally, numerical results are presented to demonstrate the validity of our analysis and show the advantages of NOMA over conventional orthogonal multiple access. Moreover, simulation results verify that the optimal relay location for NOMA should be close to the source node.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752764/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","volume":"5","accessionNumber":"16720305","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"2017","htmlLink":"/document/7752764/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis for Downlink Relaying Aided Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Networks With Imperfect CSI Over Nakagami- ${m}$ Fading","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"the Project Funded by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2015M580816"},{"fundingName":"the National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501347"},{"fundingName":"the National Basic Research Program of China 973 Program","grantNumber":"2012CB316100"},{"fundingName":"the 111 project","grantNumber":"B08038"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Performance Analysis for Downlink Relaying Aided Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Networks With Imperfect CSI Over Nakagami- ${m}$ Fading","sourcePdf":"access-men-2631482-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08368S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7752764","onlineDate":"22 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7752765,"authors":[{"name":"Wenwu Yu","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7959588/7752765/wyu-2623901-small.gif","p":["Wenwu Yu (S\u201907\u2013M\u201912\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.Sc. degree in information and computing science and the M.Sc. degree in applied mathematics from the Department of Mathematics, Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2004 and 2007, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2010.","He is currently the Founding Director of the Laboratory of Cooperative Control of Complex Systems, an Associate Director with the Research Center for Complex Systems and Network Sciences, an Associate Dean with the Department of Mathematics, and a Full Professor with the Distinguished Young Honor with Southeast University.

A distributed full-order sliding-mode surface is designed based on the homogeneity with dilation for reaching second-order consensus in multiagent systems, under which the sliding-mode states are decoupled. Then, the SMC is applied to the decoupled sliding-mode states to reach their origin in finite time, which is the sliding-mode surface. The states of agents can first reach the designed sliding-mode surface in finite time and then move to the second-order consensus state along the surface in finite time as well. The DSMC designed in this paper can eliminate the influence of singularity problems and weaken the influence of chattering, which is still very difficult in the SMC systems. In addition, DSMC proposes a general decoupling framework for designing SMC in networked multiagent systems.

Instead, disruptive approaches, such as six-port modulators for processing of electromagnetic waves and optical pulses, should be employed to push up the wireless data rate above 100 Gb/s. The key variables to consider for high-speed digital communications are bandwidth, modulation order, and signal-to-noise ratio.

Existing algorithms often require high communication overhead, because they have to collect sufficient information that they can then use to dispatch requests for hotspot data fairly. We propose an efficient scheme to achieve approximately optimal load balancing while keeping communication overhead low, namely, self-adaptive replication management (SARM). Our approach estimates the access strength of hotspot data and establishes adequate number of replicas on nodes based on their load conditions. Each node uses a dynamic scheduling algorithm to address requests for hotspot data. If the load conditions of all dispatched nodes exceed the fair load estimate, a minimum scheduling algorithm is used to dispatch the requests; otherwise, a probabilistic scheduling algorithm is adopted instead. In another word, SARM automatically switches the scheduling algorithms according to fair load estimates and the load conditions on nodes. Consequently, it eliminates request burstiness while achieving stable load balancing. To avoid excessive communication overhead, the fair load estimates are updated within a fixed time interval. Moreover, when the load variations in a node exceed a specific threshold, their load conditions are dynamically updated to other nodes. Finally, we also consider data availability in SARM. We present simulations and analysis on the performance of our approach compared with other schemes under a variety of load conditions.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2631490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","startPage":"7495","endPage":"7504","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07752773.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elastic Load Balancing Using Self-Adaptive Replication Management","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752773/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7752773/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Elastic Load Balancing Using Self-Adaptive Replication Management","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"16904558","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003711","fundingName":"MOST and Shih Chien University, Taiwan","grantNumber":"105-2221-E-158-003 and USC-105-08-01005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Elastic Load Balancing Using Self-Adaptive Replication Management","sourcePdf":"access-yang-2631490-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08082S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7752773","onlineDate":"22 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7752775,"authors":[{"name":"Biao Luo","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/8026346/7752775/luo-2623859-small.gif","p":["Biao Luo (M\u201915) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from Xiangtan University, Xiangtan, China, in 2006 and 2009, and the Ph.D. degree from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2014.","He is an Assistant Professor with the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing.

By using offline and online data rather than the mathematical system model, the PGADP algorithm improves control policy with a gradient descent scheme. The convergence of the PGADP algorithm is proved by demonstrating that the constructed Q-function sequence converges to the optimal Q-function. Based on the PGADP algorithm, the adaptive control method is developed with an actor-critic structure and the method of weighted residuals. Its convergence properties are analyzed, where the approximate Q-function converges to its optimum. Computer simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the PGADP-based adaptive control method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752775/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","volume":"47","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"17153982","pubMedId":"27893404","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7752775/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Policy Gradient Adaptive Dynamic Programming for Data-Based Optimal Control","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61233001, 61273140, 61304086, 61374105, 61503377, 61533017, 61473011 and U1501251"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Policy Gradient Adaptive Dynamic Programming for Data-Based Optimal Control","sourcePdf":"tcyb-liu-2623859-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168287S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"8026346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"8026346","articleId":"7752775","onlineDate":"22 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":7752779,"authors":[{"name":"Jianhui Lv","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Jianhui","lastName":"Lv","orcid":"0000-0003-0884-6601","id":"37086035923"},{"name":"Xingwei Wang","affiliation":["College of Software, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Xingwei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085557064"},{"name":"Min Huang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085366021"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7752779","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":747},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752779","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Atmospheric modeling","Computational modeling","Explosives","Ant colony optimization","Probabilistic logic","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ant colony optimisation","Internet","probability","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ICN routing mechanism","ant colony optimization","ACO","information-centric networking","AIRCS","continuous content concentration model","similarity relation model","forwarding probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Information-centric networking","ant colony optimization","content concentration","similarity relation"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we propose a novel Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)-inspired Information-Centric Networking (ICN) Routing mechanism based on Content concentration and Similarity relation (AIRCS).

Compared with some other non-orthogonal multiple access techniques, such as low density signature, SCMA can achieve better performance due to the shaping gain of the SCMA code words. However, despite the sparsity of the code words, the decoding complexity of the current message passing algorithm utilized by SCMA is still prohibitively high. In this paper, by exploring the lattice structure of SCMA code words, we propose a low-complexity decoding algorithm based on list sphere decoding (LSD). The LSD avoids the exhaustive search for all possible hypotheses and only considers signal within a hypersphere. As LSD can be viewed a depth-first tree search algorithm, we further propose several methods to prune the redundancy-visited nodes in order to reduce the size of the search tree. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the decoding complexity substantially while the performance loss compared with the existing algorithm is negligible.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2631468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2631468","startPage":"621","endPage":"634","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7855844/07752784.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Complexity Iterative Receiver Design for Sparse Code Multiple Access","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752784/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Low Complexity Iterative Receiver Design for Sparse Code Multiple Access","volume":"65","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2017","accessionNumber":"16669138","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7752784/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"#61671294"},{"fundingName":"National 863 Project","grantNumber":"#2015AA01A710"},{"fundingName":"STCSM Key Fundamental Project","grantNumber":"#16JC1402900"},{"fundingName":"GXNSF","grantNumber":"#2015GXNSFDA139037"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Complexity Iterative Receiver Design for Sparse Code Multiple Access","sourcePdf":"tcomm-chen-2631468-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153486S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7855844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"7855844","articleId":"7752784","onlineDate":"22 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7752791,"authors":[{"name":"Claudia Vasanelli","affiliation":["Institute of Microwave Engineering, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Claudia","lastName":"Vasanelli","id":"38547504900"},{"name":"Rahul Batra","affiliation":["Institute of Microwave Engineering, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Batra","id":"38667442500"},{"name":"Adolfo Di Serio","affiliation":["Institute of Microwave Engineering, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Adolfo Di","lastName":"Serio","id":"37086087933"},{"name":"Frank Boegelsack","affiliation":["Institute of Microwave Engineering, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Boegelsack","id":"37378203900"},{"name":"Christian Waldschmidt","affiliation":["Institute of Microwave Engineering, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Waldschmidt","id":"37281001700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"7752791","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2333},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"Multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radars show improved angular resolution compared to traditional phased-array radar systems.

These systems aim to provide natural interfaces that do not rely on the user providing active and explicit inputs. Instead, user intentions should be inferred implicitly from our natural interactions with the environment and with each other, in order to derive inputs. This requires a large number of sensors to detect signals from interactions and signal-processing to infer the intentions. LAE is a well-suited technology for creating the sensors, enabling these to be diverse and distributed but also conformal. This eases integration in/on environmental and personal surfaces. In order to address the signal-processing required, as well as the other system functions, we develop hybrid LAE/CMOS architectures, which exploit the complementary strengths of the two technologies. We demonstrate the hybrid architectures in several testbed systems, and focus on two of these as case studies: 1) A source separation system, which uses a large-area microphone array to separate the voice of multiple simultaneous speakers in a room; 2) An electroencephalogram (EEG) acquisition and biomarker-extraction system based on flexible, thin-film electronics.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/5503868/7879373/7752794-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752794/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","volume":"7","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"16759848","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7752794/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Large-Area Electronics: A Platform for Next-Generation Human- Computer Interfaces","openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Large-Area Electronics: A Platform for Next-Generation Human- Computer Interfaces","sourcePdf":"jetcas-sanzrobinson-2620474-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108346S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"7879373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7879373","articleId":"7752794","onlineDate":"22 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7752798,"authors":[{"name":"Karim Lekadir","affiliation":["Computer Vision Center, Barcelona, Spain","Department of Radiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Karim","lastName":"Lekadir","id":"37545769900"},{"name":"Alfiia Galimzianova","affiliation":["Department of Radiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Alfiia","lastName":"Galimzianova","id":"37085634972"},{"name":"\u00c0ngels Betriu","affiliation":["Unit for the Detection and Treatment of Atherothrombotic Diseases, Institute of Biomedical Research, Lleida, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"\u00c0ngels","lastName":"Betriu","id":"37086079608"},{"name":"Maria del Mar Vila","affiliation":["Cardiovascular Epidemiology and Genetics Research Group, Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"del Mar Vila","id":"37086080353"},{"name":"Laura Igual","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Universitat de Barcelona 08007, Spain","Computer Vision Center, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Igual","id":"37541314600"},{"name":"Daniel L.

Due to its low costs and wide availability, carotid ultrasound has the potential to become the modality of choice for plaque characterization in clinical practice. However, its significant image noise, coupled with the small size of the plaques and their complex appearance, makes it difficult for automated techniques to discriminate between the different plaque constituents. In this paper, we propose to address this challenging problem by exploiting the unique capabilities of the emerging deep learning framework. More specifically, and unlike existing works which require a priori definition of specific imaging features or thresholding values, we propose to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) that will automatically extract from the images the information that is optimal for the identification of the different plaque constituents. We used approximately 90 000 patches extracted from a database of images and corresponding expert plaque characterizations to train and to validate the proposed CNN. The results of cross-validation experiments show a correlation of about 0.90 with the clinical assessment for the estimation of lipid core, fibrous cap, and calcified tissue areas, indicating the potential of deep learning for the challenging task of automatic characterization of plaque composition in carotid ultrasound.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752798/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","volume":"21","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"16638879","pubMedId":"27893402","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7752798/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Convolutional Neural Network for Automatic Characterization of Plaque Composition in Carotid Ultrasound","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Marie-Curie Actions Program of the European Union","grantNumber":"(FP7/2007-2013)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000783","fundingName":"REA","grantNumber":"600388"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"NIH","grantNumber":"U01CA142555 and 1U01CA190214"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007065","fundingName":"NVIDIA"},{"fundingName":"FIS","grantNumber":"CP12/03287 and RD12/0042/0061"},{"fundingName":"European Regions Development"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003741","fundingName":"ICREA"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"NIH","grantNumber":"CA160251 and U01 CA187947"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Convolutional Neural Network for Automatic Characterization of Plaque Composition in Carotid Ultrasound","sourcePdf":"jbhi-lekadir-2631401-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090999S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"7839252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"7839252","articleId":"7752798","onlineDate":"22 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":7752801,"authors":[{"name":"Haipeng Yao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7752801/yao-2624781-small.gif","p":["Haipeng Yao received the M.S. degree in wireless communications and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2006 and 2008, respectively.

Another emerging technology which is big data analysis has also won lots of attentions from academia to industry. Many splendid researches have been done on CCN, SDN, and big data, which all have addressed separately in the traditional literature. In this paper, we propose a novel network paradigm to jointly consider CCN, SDN, and big data, and provide the architecture internal data flow, big data processing, and use cases which indicate the benefits and applicability. Simulation results are exhibited to show the potential benefits relating to the proposed network paradigm.

We have investigated the mechanisms underlying the gate breakdown by adopting different stress conditions, analyzing the influence of the temperature, and investigating the activation energy of the traps.

A novel structure along with an analog calibration technique is proposed in designing the cell that helps it to overcome low temperature induced nonlinear and mismatch effects. Due to the flexible configuration of the cell architecture, it can be used in both LSB and MSB parts of a partially-segmented CS DAC.

Pilot-based estimators require additional pilot symbols for enhancing accuracy, whereas the proposed estimator uses data symbols. Several of the existing estimators assume complete information on large scale fading coefficients of the interfering cells which requires heavy overhead. However, the proposed estimator solves this problem by an estimate obtained from the received samples. Further, we show that the proposed estimator converges almost in one iteration, and achieves appreciable improvement over the existing pilot-based and data-aided estimators in a pilot contaminated scenario.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/7857815/07752822.pdf","startPage":"70","endPage":"73","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2016.2631535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2016.2631535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7857815","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752822","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Semi-Blind Channel Estimation Algorithm for Massive MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","Iterative methods","Mean square error methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","iterative methods","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semi-blind channel estimation algorithm","massive MIMO systems","semiblind iterative space alternating generalized expectation maximization","minimum mean square error","MMSE estimate","SAGE algorithm","received samples"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Semi-blind","SAGE","channel estimation","massive MIMO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752822/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Semi-Blind Channel Estimation Algorithm for Massive MIMO Systems","volume":"6","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7752822/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16690202","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Semi-Blind Channel Estimation Algorithm for Massive MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"lwc-mawatwal-2631535-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050194S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"7857815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7857815","articleId":"7752822","onlineDate":"22 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7752833,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Arshad Nasir","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7855844/7752833/nasir-2631465-small.gif","p":["Ali Arshad Nasir (S\u201909\u2013M\u201913) received the Ph.D. degree in telecommunications engineering from Australian National University, Australia, in 2013.

In the power-splitting (PS) mode, they are simultaneously transmitted using the same signal by the base station (BS) and later separated at the user (UE)'s receiver by a power splitter. In the time-switching (TS) mode, they are either transmitted separately in time by the BS or received separately in time by the UE. In this paper, the BS transmit beamformers are jointly designed with either the receive PS ratios or the transmit TS ratios in a multicell network that implements wireless information and power transfer (WIPT). Imposing UE-harvested energy constraints, the design objectives include: 1) maximizing the minimum UE rate under the BS transmit power constraint, and 2) minimizing the maximum BS transmit power under the UE data rate constraint. New iterative algorithms of low computational complexity are proposed to efficiently solve the formulated difficult nonconvex optimization problems, where each iteration either solves one simple convex quadratic program or one simple second-order-cone-program. Simulation results show that these algorithms converge quickly after only a few iterations. Notably, the transmit TS-based WIPT system is not only more easily implemented but outperforms the receive PS-based WIPT system as it better exploits the beamforming design at the transmitter side.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2631465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2631465","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7855844/07752833.pdf","startPage":"876","endPage":"889","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamforming Design for Wireless Information and Power Transfer Systems: Receive Power-Splitting Versus Transmit Time-Switching","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/26/7855844/7752833-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming Design for Wireless Information and Power Transfer Systems: Receive Power-Splitting Versus Transmit Time-Switching","volume":"65","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752833/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16669126","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752833/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council\u2019s Discovery Projects","grantNumber":"DP130104617"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000287","fundingName":"U.K. Royal Academy of Engineering Research Fellowship","grantNumber":"RF1415\\14\\22"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.

However, the throughput of the state-of-the-art VLC backscatter is limited by simple single-carrier pulsed modulation scheme, such as ON-OFF keying (OOK). In this letter, a novel pixelated VLC backscatter is proposed and implemented to overcome the channel capacity limitation. In particular, multiple smaller VLC backscatters are integrated to generate multi-level signals, which enables the usage of advanced modulation schemes. Based on experimental results, rate adaptation at different communication distances can be employed to enhance the achievable data rate. Compared with OOK, the data rate can be tripled, when 8-pulse amplitude modulation is used at 2 m. In general, $n$ -fold throughput enhancement is realized by utilizing $n$ smaller VLC backscatters, while incurring negligible additional energy using the same device space as that of a single large backscatter.","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2016.2631946","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/68/7820237/07752834.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2016.2631946","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","startPage":"177","endPage":"180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pixelated VLC-Backscattering for Self-Charging Indoor IoT Devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752834","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15, 15 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Pixelated VLC-Backscattering for Self-Charging Indoor IoT Devices","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752834/","volume":"29","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7752834/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"15 Jan.15, 2017","accessionNumber":"16598657","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pixelated VLC-Backscattering for Self-Charging Indoor IoT Devices","sourcePdf":"lpt-shao-2631946-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053675S","chronDate":"Jan.15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"7820237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7820237","articleId":"7752834","onlineDate":"22 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7752836,"authors":[{"name":"Anupriya Gogna","affiliation":["Indraprasatha Institute of Information Technology"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Anupriya","lastName":"Gogna","id":"37085345807"},{"name":"Angshul Majumdar","affiliation":["Indraprasatha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi, India"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Angshul","lastName":"Majumdar","id":"37085341967"},{"name":"Rabab Ward","affiliation":["University of British Columbia"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Rabab","lastName":"Ward","id":"37272152500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9294"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2531"}],"articleNumber":"7752836","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2100},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752836","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Standards","Correlation","Compressed sensing","Signal analysis","Monitoring","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric potentials","biomedical telemetry","body area networks","compressed sensing","electrocardiography","electroencephalography","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical disorders","medical signal processing","neurophysiology","signal classification","signal reconstruction","telemedicine"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semisupervised stacked label consistent autoencoder","biomedical signal reconstruction","telemonitoring purposes","compressed sensing","linear classification map","optimization problem","Split Bregman technique","ECG signal reconstruction","arrhythmia classification","EEG signal reconstruction","seizure classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Body area network (BAN)","classification","deep learning","reconstruction"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Electrocardiography","Information Storage and Retrieval","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Supervised Machine Learning"]}],"abstract":"Objective: An autoencoder-based framework that simultaneously reconstruct and classify biomedical signals is proposed. Previous work has treated reconstruction and classification as separate problems. This is the first study that proposes a combined framework to address the issue in a holistic fashion. Methods: For telemonitoring purposes, reconstruction techniques of biomedical signals are largely based on compressed sensing (CS); these are \u201cdesigned\u201d techniques where the reconstruction formulation is based on some \u201cassumption\u201d regarding the signal. In this study, we propose a new paradigm for reconstruction-the reconstruction is \u201clearned,\u201d using an autoencoder; it does not require any assumption regarding the signal as long as there is sufficiently large training data. But since the final goal is to analyze/classify the signal, the system can also learn a linear classification map that is added inside the autoencoder. The ensuing optimization problem is solved using the Split Bregman technique. Results: Experiments were carried out on reconstructing and classifying electrocardiogram (ECG) (arrhythmia classification) and EEG (seizure classification) signals. Conclusion: Our proposed tool is capable of operating in a semi-supervised fashion. We show that our proposed method is better in reconstruction and more than an order magnitude faster than CS based methods; it is capable of real-time operation. Our method also yields better results than recently proposed classification methods. Significance: This is the first study offering an alternative to CS-based reconstruction.

The ERNs leverage existing automatic speech recognition technology by constraining the search space via including the likely phonetic error patterns of the target words in addition to the canonical transcriptions. MDDs are achieved by comparing the recognized transcriptions with the canonical ones. Although this approach performs reasonably well, it has the following issues: 1) Learning the error patterns of the target words to generate the ERNs remains a challenging task. Phones or phone errors missing from the ERNs cannot be recognized even if we have well-trained acoustic models; and 2) acoustic models and phonological rules are trained independently, and hence, contextual information is lost. To address these issues, we propose an acoustic-graphemic-phonemic model (AGPM) using a multidistribution DNN, whose input features include acoustic features, as well as corresponding graphemes and canonical transcriptions (encoded as binary vectors). The AGPM can implicitly model both grapheme-to-likely-pronunciation and phoneme-to-likely-pronunciation conversions, which are integrated into acoustic modeling. With the AGPM, we develop a unified MDD framework, which works much like free-phone recognition. Experiments show that our method achieves a phone error rate (PER) of 11.1%. The false rejection rate (FRR), false acceptance rate (FAR), and diagnostic error rate (DER) for MDD are 4.6%, 30.5%, and 13.5%, respectively. It outperforms the ERN approach using DNNs as acoustic models, whose PER, FRR, FAR, and DER are 16.8%, 11.0%, 43.6%, and 32.3%, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752846/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16539724","htmlLink":"/document/7752846/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","volume":"25","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis in L2 English Speech Using Multidistribution Deep Neural Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"HKSAR Government Research Grants Council General Research Fund","grantNumber":"14207315"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis in L2 English Speech Using Multidistribution Deep Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"taslp-li-2621675-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150931S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"7756694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7756694","articleId":"7752846","onlineDate":"22 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7752850,"authors":[{"name":"Mustafa A.

Simulation results indicate that the TDFA performance with pump at 1570 nm is more efficient than pump at 793 nm for core pumped thulium-doped silica fiber. Our findings show that the maximum gain reaches up to 30 dB with a 27 dBm pump power when a -10 dBm seed wavelength at 1840 nm is used. In contrast to indirect pumping at 793 nm, only 22 dB maximum gain is achieved under the same conditions. The model is also validated with previous experimental work.

The primary purpose of topology control ensures the connectivity of wireless nodes participated in the network. Low-power Internet of Things communication networks look like wireless network environments in which the main communication devices are wireless devices with limited energy like battery. In this paper, we propose a distributed topology control algorithm by merging the combinatorial block design from a design theory with the multiples of 2. The proposed technique especially focuses on asynchronous and asymmetric neighbor discovery. The concept of block design is used to generate the neighbor discovery schedule when a target duty cycle is given. In addition, the multiples of 2 are applied to overcome the challenge of the block design and support asymmetric operation. We analyze the worst case discovery latency and energy consumption numerically by calculating the total number of slots and wake-up slots based on the given duty cycle. It shows that our proposed method has the smallest total number of slots and wake-up slots among existing representative neighbor discovery protocols. The numerical analysis represents the proposed technique find neighbors quickly with minimum battery power compared with other protocols for distributed topology control. For future research direction, we could perform a simulation study or real experiment to investigate the best parameter for choosing the multiple of a certain number.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

new technologies inspired by brainlike neuromorphic computing. However, developing automated characterization algorithms for the metastable resistive state (RS) transitions, i.e., volatility in the myriad RRAM configurations fabricated for achieving desired performance remains a major bottleneck. Here, we propose a novel algorithm for extracting the volatility parameters for the utilized metal-oxide TiOx-based devices. The module applies an appropriate stimulus and then estimates the RS changes of the device under test (DUT) using the standard two mean t-test method over a fixed interval of time. The module halts when an equilibrium state has been detected and is followed by a retention condition that checks the DUT for the achieved equilibrium state. The output of the proposed module determines the time the t-test lasted for and the voltage range under which the DUT can be safely operated in purely volatile region. In conclusion, the proposed characterization protocol ensures a methodical process development for automated characterization of RRAM arrays for operating them in the volatile region.","doi":"10.1109/LED.2016.2631631","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/55/7802592/07752861.pdf","startPage":"28","endPage":"31","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2016.2631631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7802592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Volatility Characterization for RRAM Devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752861/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Volatility Characterization for RRAM Devices","volume":"38","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16581302","htmlLink":"/document/7752861/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Coordinated Research on Long-Term Challenges in Information and Communication Sciences and Technologies ERA-Net"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EPSRC EP/J00801X/1 and EP/K017829/1"},{"fundingName":"FP7 RAMP"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Volatility Characterization for RRAM Devices","sourcePdf":"led-gupta-2631631-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060213S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"7802592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7802592","articleId":"7752861","onlineDate":"22 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7752865,"authors":[{"name":"Qifa Yan","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Qifa","lastName":"Yan","orcid":"0000-0002-0746-9819","id":"37085888831"},{"name":"Udaya Parampalli","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Udaya","lastName":"Parampalli","id":"37540693800"},{"name":"Xiaohu Tang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohu","lastName":"Tang","orcid":"0000-0002-7938-7812","id":"37280010500"},{"name":"Qingchun Chen","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Qingchun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37290092800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7752865","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":670},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Indexes","Streaming media","Libraries","Upper bound","Encoding","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network coding","probability","random codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online coded caching network","random access","probability","coded outdated file eviction scheme","coded OER scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coded caching","online video streaming","random access"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we consider a caching network with two characteristics: first, the operations of users' caches have to be performed on the fly, and second, each user has access to the system with a known probability.

By utilizing the knowledge of eviction in the server and applying the technique of coded caching to the active users in each time, we propose and analyze a new scheme called coded outdated file eviction for random access (coded OER).

antenna is presented for Ka-band wireless communication. A novel triple-resonant cavity is proposed to implement mode conversion and impedance matching in the 2 \u00d7 2-element subarray. A ridge waveguide polarizer is integrated to form the left-hand circular polarization (LHCP) and the right-hand circular polarization (RHCP). A flyover-shaped full-corporate feeding network is designed to accommodate the dual polarizations and keep the wideband characteristic for a large-scale array. Subarray spacing is used to optimize the port-to-port isolation and decrease the sidelobe level at some definite angles. Computer numerically controlled machining technology is applied to fabricating a 16\u00d716-element prototype. Measured results demonstrate a bandwidth of 16% from 27.6 to 32.4 GHz for the dual polarizations, in terms of good reflection coefficient and axial ratio. A maximum gain of 32.8 dBic is achieved at 28.8 GHz. A total efficiency over 60% is obtained throughout the above band for both LHCP and RHCP ports.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2016.2631953","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7892904/07752869.pdf","startPage":"2135","endPage":"2139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2016.2631953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7892904","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Wideband Dual Circularly Polarized Full-Corporate Waveguide Array Antenna Fed by Triple-Resonant Cavities","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752869","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752869/","displayDocTitle":"A Wideband Dual Circularly Polarized Full-Corporate Waveguide Array Antenna Fed by Triple-Resonant Cavities","volume":"65","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16807068","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752869/","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61622105 and 61631012"},{"fundingName":"Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of Sichuan Province","grantNumber":"2015JQO005"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"ZYGX2014Z008"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003181","fundingName":"Foundation for the Author of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of China","grantNumber":"201338"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Wideband Dual Circularly Polarized Full-Corporate Waveguide Array Antenna Fed by Triple-Resonant Cavities","sourcePdf":"tap-cheng-2631953-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065084S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7892904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7892904","articleId":"7752869","onlineDate":"22 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":7752872,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Abdolrazzaghi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7792229/7752872/abdol-2631618-small.gif","p":["Mohammad Abdolrazzaghi (S\u201914) received the B.Sc. degree from the Electrical Engineering Department, Iran University of Science and Technology, in 2009.

To mitigate and exploit the complex interference, we consider two important utility optimization problems, i.e., the sum power minimization problem and the sum-rate maximization problem. In the first problem, our aim is to minimize the total transmission power under both transmission rate and energy harvesting (EH) constraints. An iterative algorithm based on alternating optimization (AO) and with guaranteed monotonic convergence is proposed to successively optimize the transceiver coefficients. The algorithm consists of three main steps, where the concave-convex procedure (CCCP), the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion, and the semidefinite relaxation technique are, respectively, employed to compute the vectors of power splitting ratios, the receiving matrices, and the transmitting beamforming vectors. Two simplified algorithms based on fixed beamformers, namely, the maximum ratio transmission and the maximum signal-to-interference-leakage beamformers are also proposed. In the second problem, our aim is to maximize the sum-rate under additional power and EH constraints. Due to the highly non-convex nature of this problem, we first reformulate it into an equivalent-weighted MMSE problem by introducing suitable weight factors, such that the global optima of the two problems are identical. Then, by utilizing the concept of AO and CCCP, we show that the equivalent problem can be efficiently solved. Again, with the aid of the fixed beamformers, two simplified algorithms are provided to reduce the computational complexity. Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2631523","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

The proposed antenna is operated in the long term evolution band (1.7-2.7 GHz), and has a compact size of 200 mm \u00d7 200 mm \u00d7 30.6 mm (about 0.25\u03bb height at 2.7 GHz). The antenna structure consists of a horizontally polarized circular loop antenna, a vertically polarized lowprofile monopole antenna, and an AMC reflector. By carefully designing the reflection characteristics of the AMC reflector, the profile height of the proposed antenna is significantly reduced as compared with those of antennas backed by conventional perfect electric conductor (PEC) ground planes. Simulated and measured results show that the proposed antenna is able to achieve over 45% impedance bandwidth (VSWR <; 1.8) with stable radiation patterns in the band of 1.7-2.7 GHz. Owing to the attractive wide bandwidth, low-profile configuration, and ease of fabrication, the proposed antenna is suitable for microbase station systems, especially for indoor ceiling antenna networking applications.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2016.2631147","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7803621/07752878.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2016.2631147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7803621","startPage":"368","endPage":"374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low Profile Dual-Polarized Wideband Omnidirectional Antenna Based on AMC Reflector","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752878","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Low Profile Dual-Polarized Wideband Omnidirectional Antenna Based on AMC Reflector","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752878/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16581715","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7752878/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61231001, 61571101 and 61631006"},{"fundingName":"111 Project of China","grantNumber":"B07046"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low Profile Dual-Polarized Wideband Omnidirectional Antenna Based on AMC Reflector","sourcePdf":"tap-yang-2631147-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073557S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7803621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"7803621","articleId":"7752878","onlineDate":"22 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7752879,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaohui Yang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhaohui","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085667482"},{"name":"Wei Xu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Xu","id":"37536681300"},{"name":"Yiran Li","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yiran","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0003-1378-1304","id":"37085787084"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"7752879","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":71,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2265},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NOMA","Complexity theory","OFDM","Downlink","Power control","Optical transmitters","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","OFDM modulation","optical communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonorthogonal multiple access","visible light communication downlinks","downlink power control strategy","multiuser VLC systems","intensity constraints","optical modulations","nonconvex problem","equivalent convex","optimal power control algorithm","OFDM scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Visible light communication (VLC)","non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)","user fairness","convex optimization"]}],"abstract":"This letter investigates a downlink power control strategy for visible light communication (VLC) systems with non-orthogonal multiple access.

The results show that the multiplication with any constant up to 22 bits can be realized by only three ternary adders.

Our analysis assumes a Ricean fading environment, where we show that the SNR at a given terminal is well approximated by the gamma distribution and we derive its parameters. The analysis relies on densities of an arbitrary eigenvalue and a pair of arbitrary eigenvalues of the uncorrelated complex non-standard, noncentral Wishart matrices. Unlike previous studies, we consider microwave and millimeter-wave channel parameters with a unique Rice factor for each terminal. We demonstrate that stronger line-of-sight adversely impacts the ZF SNR, while increasing the Rice factor variability results in higher peak ZF SNR. Our approximations are insensitive to changes in the system dimension and operating SNRs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zero-Forcing Precoding Performance in Multiuser MIMO Systems With Heterogeneous Ricean Fading","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2016.2631602","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/7857815/07752888.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"77","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2016.2631602","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7857815","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752888","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752888/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Zero-Forcing Precoding Performance in Multiuser MIMO Systems With Heterogeneous Ricean Fading","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7752888/","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16690197","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero-Forcing Precoding Performance in Multiuser MIMO Systems With Heterogeneous Ricean Fading","sourcePdf":"lwc-tataria-2631602-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140109S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"7857815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7857815","articleId":"7752888","onlineDate":"22 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7752892,"authors":[{"name":"Mei Jiang","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Environment Effects for Aerospace Vehicle, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7839250/7752892/jiang-2631589-small.gif","p":["Mei Jiang (S\u201909) was born in Henan, China, in 1987.

The antenna consists of a planar lens and a linear array of receive/transmit elements. To lower the insertion and reflection loss, the lens is formed by the two-layered ultrathin MTM-based surface separated with air and fed by substrate integrated waveguide-fed stacked-patch antennas. The effects of the focal-to-diameter ( f/D) on the power distribution of the lens are investigated to work out a design method. A planar lens antenna fed with seven elements is, for example, designed to operate at 28-GHz bands. The measured results show that the proposed antenna can achieve a scanning coverage of \u00b127\u00b0 with a gain tolerance of 3.7 dB and a maximum gain of 24.2 dBi with an aperture efficiency of 24.5% over the operating bandwidth of 26.6-29 GHz.

In the new scheme, two successive signal periods are put into one transmit duration to minimize the time-variant channel effect. The even and odd components of the transmitted waveforms are modulated into distinct Doppler frequencies in the azimuth direction and can be separated by bandpass filter in the range-Doppler domain. The presented STC scheme can suppress the interchannel ambiguous energy caused by the time-variant channel responses, which typically occur in conventional STC schemes, and increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the echoes by a decoding matrix. To further suppress the interference, a waveform called time and frequency comb-like chirp (TFCC) is proposed. With the application of the complementary comb-like structure in the time and frequency domains, two TFCC waveforms are short-term shift-orthogonal and constant envelope. Moreover, these corresponding TFCC waveforms can share the same antenna and time gate without sacrificing any TFCC waveforms' peak level. The theoretical analysis and simulation results illustrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Space-Time Coding Scheme With Time and Frequency Comb-Like Chirp Waveforms for MIMO-SAR","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2016.2631945","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/7852559/07752897.pdf","startPage":"391","endPage":"403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2016.2631945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7852559","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752897","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752897/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","displayDocTitle":"A Space-Time Coding Scheme With Time and Frequency Comb-Like Chirp Waveforms for MIMO-SAR","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7752897/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16669234","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61331015"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Space-Time Coding Scheme With Time and Frequency Comb-Like Chirp Waveforms for MIMO-SAR","sourcePdf":"jstsp-zhang-2631945-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080862S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"7852559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7852559","articleId":"7752897","onlineDate":"22 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7752901,"authors":[{"name":"Amirthagunaraj Yogarathinam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/8388565/7752901/yogar-2631448-small.gif","p":["Amirthagunaraj Yogarathinam (S\u201912) received the B.E. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from the University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka, in 2013.

Remote feedback signals sent through communication channels encounter data dropout, which is represented by the Gilbert-Elliott model. An observer-driven reduced copy (ORC) approach is presented, which uses the knowledge of the nominal system dynamics during data dropouts to improve the damping performance where conventional feedback would suffer. An expression for the expectation of the bound on the error norm between the actual and the estimated states relating uncertainties in the cyber system due to data dropout and physical system due to change in operating conditions is also derived. The key contribution comes from the analytical derivation of the impact of coupling between the cyber and the physical layer on ORC performance. Monte Carlo simulation is performed to calculate the dispersion of the error bound. Nonlinear time-domain simulations demonstrate that the ORC produces significantly better performance compared to conventional feedback under higher data drop situations.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/5165411/8388565/7752901-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752901/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","volume":"9","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2018","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7752901/","accessionNumber":"17857400","displayDocTitle":"Wide-Area Damping Control Using Multiple DFIG-Based Wind Farms Under Stochastic Data Packet Dropouts","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"1657024"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Wide-Area Damping Control Using Multiple DFIG-Based Wind Farms Under Stochastic Data Packet Dropouts","sourcePdf":"tsg-chaudhuri-2631448-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063853S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8388565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8388565","articleId":"7752901","onlineDate":"22 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7752906,"authors":[{"name":"Benfei Wang","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7874245/7752906/wang-2631438-small.gif","p":["Benfei Wang received the B.Sc. degree in electronic information\n science and technology from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2011.

Since each switch updates its flow table independently and asynchronously, the transition of data plane state - if done directly from the initial to the final stage - may result in serious flash congestion. Prior work strives to find a congestion-free update plan with multiple stages, each with the property that there will be no congestion independent of the update order. Yet congestion-free update may prevent the network from being fully utilized. It also requires solving a series of LP which is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose congestion-minimizing update and focus on two general problems: The first is to find routing at each intermediate stage that minimizes transient congestion for a given number of intermediate stages. The second is to find the minimum number of intermediate stages and an update plan for a given maximum level of transient congestion. We formulate them as two optimization programs and prove their hardness. We propose a set of algorithms to find the update plan in a scalable manner. Extensive experiments with Mininet show that our solution reduces update time by 50 percent and saves control overhead by 38 percent compared to prior work.","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2016.2631519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2016.2631519","startPage":"800","endPage":"812","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4629386/8861194/07752911.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8861194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Congestion-Minimizing Network Update in Data Centers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752911/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1 2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Congestion-Minimizing Network Update in Data Centers","volume":"12","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2019","accessionNumber":"19115367","publicationDate":"1 Sept.-Oct. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/7752911/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Hong Kong RGC","grantNumber":"ECS-21201714, GRF-11202315 and CRF-C7036-15G"},{"fundingName":"China 973","grantNumber":"2014CB340303"},{"fundingName":"China NSF grants","grantNumber":"61472252, 61133006, 61321491 and 61502229"},{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CNS 1449860, CNS 1461932, CNS 1460971, CNS 1439672, CNS 1301774 and ECCS 1231461"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Congestion-Minimizing Network Update in Data Centers","sourcePdf":"tsc-zheng-2631519-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.311011S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"8861194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8861194","articleId":"7752911","onlineDate":"22 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7752914,"authors":[{"name":"Xingping Dong","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Intelligent Information Technology, School of Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Xingping Dong, photograph and biography not available at the time of\n publication."]},"firstName":"Xingping","lastName":"Dong","id":"37085426443"},{"name":"Jianbing Shen","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Intelligent Information Technology, School of Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Jianbing Shen (M'11\u2013SM'12), photograph and biography\n not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Jianbing","lastName":"Shen","id":"37655881000"},{"name":"Dajiang Yu","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Intelligent Information Technology, School of Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Dajiang Yu, photograph and biography not available at the time of\n publication."]},"firstName":"Dajiang","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086171115"},{"name":"Wenguan Wang","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Intelligent Information Technology, School of Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Wenguan Wang, photograph and biography not available at the time of\n publication."]},"firstName":"Wenguan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085410703"},{"name":"Jianhong Liu","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Intelligent Information Technology, School of Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Jianhong Liu, photograph and biography not available at the time of\n publication."]},"firstName":"Jianhong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086169650"},{"name":"Hua Huang","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Intelligent Information Technology, School of Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Hua Huang, photograph and biography not available at the time of\n publication."]},"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086170073"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-9210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0077"}],"articleNumber":"7752914","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":137,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2255},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits &amp;

However, the drifting problem caused by noisy updates is still a challenge for most highly adaptive online classifiers. In visual tracking, target object appearance variation, such as deformation and long-term occlusion, easily causes noisy updates. To overcome this problem, a new real-time occlusion-aware visual tracking algorithm is introduced. First, we learn a novel two-stage classifier with circulant structure with kernel, named integrated circulant structure kernels (ICSK). The first stage is applied for transition estimation and the second is used for scale estimation. The circulant structure makes our algorithm realize fast learning and detection. Then, the ICSK is used to detect the target without occlusion and build a classifier pool to save these classifiers with noisy updates. When the target is in heavy occlusion or after long-term occlusion, we redetect it using an optimal classifier selected from the classifier-pool according to an entropy minimization criterion. Extensive experimental results on the full benchmark demonstrate our real-time algorithm achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2016.2631884","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/7879458/07752914.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2016.2631884","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7879458","startPage":"763","endPage":"771","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Occlusion-Aware Real-Time Object Tracking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752914","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Occlusion-Aware Real-Time Object Tracking","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752914/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16759919","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7752914/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2013CB328805"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61272359"},{"fundingName":"Fok Ying-Tong Education Foundation for Young Teachers, Specialized Fund for Joint Building Program of Beijing Municipal Education Commission"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Occlusion-Aware Real-Time Object Tracking","sourcePdf":"tmm-shen-2631884-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098253S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"7879458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"7879458","articleId":"7752914","onlineDate":"22 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":7752916,"authors":[{"name":"Junhyoung Ha","affiliation":["Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/7842732/7752916/ha-2622278-small.gif","p":["Junhyoung Ha received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in mechanical\n engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2008 and 2015, respectively.","During his Ph.D. study, he was a Research Assistant with the Robotics Laboratory, School of Mechanical and Aerospace\n Engineering, Seoul National University.

Elastic instabilities can arise, however, when rotating one precurved tube inside another. In contrast to prior work that considered only tubes of piecewise constant precurvature, we allow precurvature to vary along the tube's arc length. Stability conditions for a planar tube pair are derived and used to formulate an optimal design problem. An analytic formulation of the optimal precurvature function is derived, which achieves a desired tip orientation range while maximizing stability and respecting bending strain limits. This formulation also includes straight transmission segments at the proximal ends of the tubes. The result, confirmed by both numerical and physical experiment, enables designs with enhanced stability in comparison to designs of constant precurvature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752916/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752916/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16650246","pubMedId":"28966566","volume":"33","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing Tube Precurvature to Enhance the Elastic Stability of Concentric Tube Robots","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"National Institutes of Health","grantNumber":"R01HL124020"},{"fundingName":"SNU BMRR Center","grantNumber":"DAPA-UD130070ID"},{"fundingName":"SNU-IAMD, BK21+"},{"fundingName":"MI Technology Innovation Program","grantNumber":"10048320"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing Tube Precurvature to Enhance the Elastic Stability of Concentric Tube Robots","sourcePdf":"tro-ha-2622278-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096083S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"7842732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7842732","articleId":"7752916","onlineDate":"22 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7752918,"authors":[{"name":"Saeed Zeinolabedinzadeh","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Saeed","lastName":"Zeinolabedinzadeh","orcid":"0000-0002-6520-0594","id":"38323181800"},{"name":"Hanbin Ying","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Hanbin","lastName":"Ying","id":"37085700236"},{"name":"Zachary E.

To test the generalization capability and to facilitate the wide usage of IQA techniques in real-world applications, we establish a large-scale database named the Waterloo Exploration Database, which in its current state contains 4744 pristine natural images and 94 880 distorted images created from them. Instead of collecting the mean opinion score for each image via subjective testing, which is extremely difficult if not impossible, we present three alternative test criteria to evaluate the performance of IQA models, namely, the pristine/distorted image discriminability test, the listwise ranking consistency test, and the pairwise preference consistency test (P-test). We compare 20 well-known IQA models using the proposed criteria, which not only provide a stronger test in a more challenging testing environment for existing models, but also demonstrate the additional benefits of using the proposed database. For example, in the P-test, even for the best performing no-reference IQA model, more than 6 million failure cases against the model are \u201cdiscovered\u201d automatically out of over 1 billion test pairs. Furthermore, we discuss how the new database may be exploited using innovative approaches in the future, to reveal the weaknesses of existing IQA models, to provide insights on how to improve the models, and to shed light on how the next-generation IQA models may be developed.

So, system operators are required to maintain plans for any unforeseen event that forces power system to operate without reliability. Contingency analysis is one of the well-known methods to paint the future scenarios in the power system. However, large numbers of possible N-k combinations make its assessment computationally prohibitive. This paper proposes a new method to search most vulnerable transmission lines efficiently based on electrical distance. Specifically, a new electrical network is first built based on the impedance matrix (by inverting admittance matrix). Then, we will prune this impedance matrix based on the number of connections in topology network. Next, the common connections in two different structures (i.e., electrical network and topology network) will be observed for contingency experiments. Our results verify that violations of transmission lines limit due to contingencies are mostly associated with those common branches. In addition, voltage profiles are studied to validate that the vulnerable transmission lines found above are critical in power system stability.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2016.2631622","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/8388565/07752937.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2016.2631622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388565","startPage":"3373","endPage":"3382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrical Distance Approach for Searching Vulnerable Branches During Contingencies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752937","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/5165411/8388565/7752937-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Electrical Distance Approach for Searching Vulnerable Branches During Contingencies","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752937/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"17857427","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7752937/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000104","fundingName":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration","grantNumber":"NNX15AK54A"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1552073"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Electrical Distance Approach for Searching Vulnerable Branches During Contingencies","sourcePdf":"tsg-ni-2631622-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070048S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8388565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8388565","articleId":"7752937","onlineDate":"22 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7752945,"authors":[{"name":"Gao Yingbin","affiliation":["Xi'an Research Institute of High Technology, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7765219/7752945/yingb-2631444-small.gif","p":["Gao Yingbin received the Bachelor's and Master's degrees\n from Xi'an Research Institute of High Technology, Xi'an, China, in 2009 and 2011, respectively, both in\n control engineering.

In this paper, we propose an information criterion for GMCA and derive a fast GMCA algorithm for extracting the first generalized minor component (GMC) by using quasi-Newton method to this information criterion. In order to extract multiple GMCs, through the weighed matrix method, this information criterion is extended into a weighted one, which has a unique global maximum attained if and only if its state matrices converge to the GMCs of the matrix pencil composed of the autocorrelation matrices of two stochastic processes. A gradient algorithm is also derived based on this weighted information criterion. Theoretical analysis shows that the gradient algorithm has self-stabilizing property and does not need the normalization operation required in other algorithms. The global convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm is accomplished through the Lyapunov method. Numerical simulations and real application are carried out to further demonstrate the accuracy and speed advantages of the proposed algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.2631444","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7765219/07752945.pdf","startPage":"947","endPage":"959","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.2631444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7765219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Generalized Information Criterion for Generalized Minor Component Extraction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752945","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15, 15 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752945/","displayDocTitle":"A Generalized Information Criterion for Generalized Minor Component Extraction","volume":"65","issue":"4","publicationDate":"15 Feb.15, 2017","accessionNumber":"16518865","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752945/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61673387 and 61374120"},{"fundingName":"National Science Fund for Distinguished Youth Scholars of China","grantNumber":"61025014"},{"fundingName":"Shaanxi Province Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"2016JM6015"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Generalized Information Criterion for Generalized Minor Component Extraction","sourcePdf":"tsp-kong-2631444-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106605S","chronDate":"Feb.15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7765219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7765219","articleId":"7752945","onlineDate":"22 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7752946,"authors":[{"name":"Huifen Hong","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/7955029/7752946/hong-2623634-small.gif","p":["Huifen Hong received the B.Sc. degree from Taishan University, Tai\u2019an, China, in 2012 and the M.Sc. degree from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2015, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","Her research interests include multiagent systems and control theory."]},"firstName":"Huifen","lastName":"Hong","orcid":"0000-0002-0649-8116","id":"37085801954"},{"name":"Wenwu Yu","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/7955029/7752946/wyu-2623634-small.gif","p":["Wenwu Yu (S\u201907\u2013M\u201912\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.Sc. degree in information and computing science and the M.Sc. degree in applied mathematics from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2004 and 2007, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2010.","He is currently the Founding Director of the Laboratory of Cooperative Control of Complex Systems, an Associate Director of the Research Center for Complex Systems and Network Sciences, an Associate Dean of the Department of Mathematics, and a Full Professor with the Distinguished Young Honor, Southeast University.

A detection scheme is proposed in this paper that utilizes free resonant currents in the pad windings to detect small changes in coupling between neighboring ground pads as the EV moves over them. The detection scheme can be made to be interoperable with all magnetic pad topologies and utilizes components that already exist in most popular electronic converters and tuning networks. Specific implementation details with several different electronic topologies are discussed and the simulation results are presented showing the detection scheme working with a vehicle driving at 100 km/h.

On the one hand, the proliferation of smart phones and advances in medical sensors and devices have driven the emergence of wireless body area networks for remote patient monitoring, also known as mobile-health (M-health), thereby providing a reliable and cost effective way to improving efficiency and quality of health care. On the other hand, the advances of M-health systems also generate extensive medical data, which could crowd today's cellular networks. Device-to-device (D2D) communications have been proposed to address this challenge, but unfortunately, security threats are also emerging because of the open nature of D2D communications between medical sensors and highly privacy-sensitive nature of medical data. Even, more disconcerting is healthcare systems that have many characteristics that make them more vulnerable to privacy attacks than in other applications. In this paper, we propose a light-weight and robust security-aware D2D-assist data transmission protocol for M-health systems by using a certificateless generalized signcryption (CLGSC) technique. Specifically, we first propose a new efficient CLGSC scheme, which can adaptively work as one of the three cryptographic primitives: signcryption, signature, or encryption, but within one single algorithm. The scheme is proved to be secure, simultaneously achieving confidentiality and unforgeability. Based on the proposed CLGSC algorithm, we further design a D2D-assist data transmission protocol for M-health systems with security properties, including data confidentiality and integrity, mutual authentication, contextual privacy, anonymity, unlinkability, and forward security. Performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed protocol can achieve the design objectives and outperform existing schemes in terms of computational and communication overhead.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752952/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2016","volume":"12","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"16596036","publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7752952/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Light-Weight and Robust Security-Aware D2D-Assist Data Transmission Protocol for Mobile-Health Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601005 and 61322104"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003995","fundingName":"University Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province","grantNumber":"KJ2015A105 and KJ2015A092"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003995","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province","grantNumber":"1608085QF138"},{"fundingName":"Key Projects of the Outstanding Young Talents Program in Universities of Anhui Province","grantNumber":"gxyqZD2016027"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Light-Weight and Robust Security-Aware D2D-Assist Data Transmission Protocol for Mobile-Health Systems","sourcePdf":"tifs-lin-2631950-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105484S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7782442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"7782442","articleId":"7752952","onlineDate":"22 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7752953,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Sun","affiliation":["Tianjin Key Laboratory of Intelligent Robotics, Nankai University, Tianjin, China","Institute of Robotics and Automatic Information Systems, College of Computer and Control Engineering,"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/7900484/7752953/sun-2631550-small.gif","p":["Ning Sun (S\u201912\u2013M\u201914) received the B.S. degree in\n measurement and control technology and instruments (with hons.) from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2009, and the\n Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering (with hons.) from Nankai University, Tianjin, China, in 2014.\n","He is currently with the Institute of Robotics and Automatic Information Systems, Nankai University.

In this paper, we consider the problem of globally stabilizing RTAC systems, which work in the vertical plane and are affected by nonvanishing matched disturbances by employing continuous control inputs. To this end, a nonlinear continuous control approach is synthesized to effectively damp out the platform oscillations, while ensuring that the eccentric ball's rotation angle returns to zero without residual swing. To our knowledge, this paper yields the first continuous controller, which is designed and analyzed without linearizing/approximating the original nonlinear dynamical equations to globally stabilize both the rotation and translation of RTAC systems influenced by nonvanishing matched disturbances. We implement experiments to show that the proposed control approach can achieve superior performance vis-\u00e0-vis existing methods and it admits for good robustness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"22","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2017","accessionNumber":"16808497","htmlLink":"/document/7752953/","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Continuous Global Stabilization Control for Underactuated RTAC Systems: Design, Analysis, and Experimentation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61503200 and 61325017"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006606","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin","grantNumber":"15JCQNJC03800"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2016M600186"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Continuous Global Stabilization Control for Underactuated RTAC Systems: Design, Analysis, and Experimentation","sourcePdf":"tmech-sun-2631550-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108917S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"7900484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"7900484","articleId":"7752953","onlineDate":"22 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":7752954,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Xi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/7922633/7752954/xi-2631900-small.gif","p":["Tao Xi received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in computer science and technology from the Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2011 and 2014, respectively.

In saliency detection, background priors, which are often regarded as pseudo-background, are effective clues to find salient objects in images. Although image boundary is commonly used as background priors, it does not work well for images of complex scenes and videos. In this paper, we explore how to identify the background priors for a video and propose a saliency-based method to detect the visual objects by using the background priors. For a video, we integrate multiple pairs of scale-invariant feature transform flows from long-range frames, and a bidirectional consistency propagation is conducted to obtain the accurate and sufficient temporal background priors, which are combined with spatial background priors to generate spatiotemporal background priors. Next, a novel dual-graph-based structure using spatiotemporal background priors is put forward in the computation of saliency maps, fully taking advantage of appearance and motion information in videos. Experimental results on different challenging data sets show that the proposed method robustly and accurately detects the video objects in both simple and complex scenes and achieves better performance compared with other the state-of-the-art video saliency models.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Salient Object Detection With Spatiotemporal Background Priors for Video","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2016.2631900","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7922633/07752954.pdf","startPage":"3425","endPage":"3436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2016.2631900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7922633","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752954","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752954/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","displayDocTitle":"Salient Object Detection With Spatiotemporal Background Priors for Video","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7752954/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"16896553","pubMedId":"27893393","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Salient Object Detection With Spatiotemporal Background Priors for Video","sourcePdf":"tip-wang-2631900-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084693S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7922633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7922633","articleId":"7752954","onlineDate":"22 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":7752956,"authors":[{"name":"Guodong Feng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Windsor, Windsor, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7874245/7752956/feng-2631524-small.gif","p":["Guodong Feng (M\u201915) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in\n electrical engineering from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2010 and 2015, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of\n Windsor, Windsor, ON, Canada.

The speed harmonic can be obtained from machine speed measurement, so the proposed approach does not require accurate machine parameters and is not influenced by the nonlinearity of the machine and drive. The torque harmonic can produce the speed harmonic of the same order, so their relation is investigated, which shows that the magnitude of the speed harmonic is proportional to the magnitude of the torque harmonic of the same order, so it can be used as a measure of torque harmonic for torque ripple minimization. Then, the torque harmonic model is developed to facilitate the design and analysis of the current controller. Afterward, a novel fuzzy-logic-based current controller is proposed to minimize the dominant torque harmonics. The proposed current controller is evaluated on a laboratory PMSM drive system under different load conditions and operation speeds.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2016.2631524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2016.2631524","startPage":"2642","endPage":"2653","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7874245/07752956.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7874245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Closed-Loop Fuzzy-Logic-Based Current Controller for PMSM Torque Ripple Minimization Using the Magnitude of Speed Harmonic as the Feedback Control Signal","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","displayDocTitle":"A Closed-Loop Fuzzy-Logic-Based Current Controller for PMSM Torque Ripple Minimization Using the Magnitude of Speed Harmonic as the Feedback Control Signal","publicationDate":"April 2017","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","volume":"64","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752956/","accessionNumber":"16723118","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752956/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Closed-Loop Fuzzy-Logic-Based Current Controller for PMSM Torque Ripple Minimization Using the Magnitude of Speed Harmonic as the Feedback Control Signal","sourcePdf":"tie-feng-2631524-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144884S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7874245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"7874245","articleId":"7752956","onlineDate":"22 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7752958,"authors":[{"name":"Gaoqi Liang","affiliation":["Center for Intelligent Electricity Networks, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Gaoqi","lastName":"Liang","id":"37085889501"},{"name":"Steven R.

The tools developed in this paper are especially beneficial if Convolutional Neural Networks are employed, but can also be used as a more general framework to validate related approaches to signal scanning. The proposed theory helps to eliminate redundant computations and renders special case treatment unnecessary, resulting in a dramatic boost in efficiency particularly on massively parallel processors.

In this method, a reference state is determined in a systematic way so that the reference torque tracking with maximum torque per ampere and flux-limited operation could be achieved. In addition, a weighting matrix for the state tracking error is optimized in offline using the linear matrix inequality based optimization problem. The efficacy of the proposed FCS-MPC method is proved by the simulation and experimental results at different working circumstances.

The goal is to detect the spectrum holes and to assign each secondary user (SU) a sensing channel with the maximum probability of being empty. In geographically dispersed CRNs, channel availability varies over the space, and this makes the sensing outcomes and sensing assignments location dependent. However, if the SUs are not equipped with location-finding technologies, fusing the sensing outcomes to find the optimal spectrum sensing assignments for the next sensing time becomes challenging for the base station (BS). To tackle this problem, we introduce a metric solely based on the sensing outcomes of SUs. Using this metric, along with a low-complexity clustering algorithm, enables the BS to efficiently divide the network into clusters. Further, we present an adaptive learning algorithm, to learn the dynamic behavior of channel occupancy in the primary network. The proposed learning algorithm considers SUs mobility model to determine the optimal learning window. To determine the sensing assignments, the BS performs a graph-theory-based coordinated multiband spectrum sensing within each cluster. Specifically, a weighted bipartite matching is employed. We have shown that cluster-CMSS significantly increases the spectrum opportunity discovery ratio for SUs at the cost of a slight increase in the energy consumption associated with spectrum sensing.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2016.2631595","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7981437/07752969.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7981437","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2016.2631595","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"6378","endPage":"6387","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cluster-CMSS: A Cluster-Based Coordinated Spectrum Sensing in Geographically Dispersed Mobile Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752969","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/25/7981437/7752969-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Cluster-CMSS: A Cluster-Based Coordinated Spectrum Sensing in Geographically Dispersed Mobile Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752969/","volume":"66","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7752969/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17026893","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1418710 and CCF-1439182"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Cluster-CMSS: A Cluster-Based Coordinated Spectrum Sensing in Geographically Dispersed Mobile Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-shahrasbi-2631595-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085636S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7981437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7981437","articleId":"7752969","onlineDate":"22 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7752972,"authors":[{"name":"Tiancheng Li","affiliation":["University of Salamanca, BISITE Research Group, Salamanca, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6884276/8010473/7752972/li-2631944-small.gif","p":["Tiancheng Li received the Bachelor's degree in mechanical and\n electrical engineering, with a minor degree in Business Administration, from Harbin Engineering University, Harbin,\n China, in 2008, the first Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from London South Bank University,\n London, UK., in 2013, and the second Doctoral degree in mechatronics engineering from Northwestern Polytechnical\n University, Xian Shi, China, in 2015.

However, a unified consensus-oriented formulation of the algorithm and its convergence performance are not explicitly available in the literature. To fill this void in this paper, set-theoretic flooding rules are defined by encapsulating the information of interest in finite sets (one set per node), namely distributed set-theoretic information flooding (DSIF). This leads to a new type of consensus called \u201ccollecting consensus,\u201d which aims to ensure that all nodes get the same information. Convergence and optimality analyses are provided based on a consistent measure of the degree of consensus of the network. Compared with the prevailing averaging consensus, the proposed DSIF protocol benefits from avoiding repeated use of any information and offering the highest converging efficiency for network consensus while being exposed to increasing node-storage requirements against communication iterations and higher communication load. The protocol has been advocated for distributed nonlinear Bayesian filtering, where each node operates a separate particle filter, and the collecting consensus is sought on the sensor data alone or jointly with intermediate local filter estimates. Simulations are provided to demonstrate the theoretical findings.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal and Information Processing over Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/6884276/8010473/07752972.pdf","startPage":"580","endPage":"591","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal and Information Processing over Networks","doi":"10.1109/TSIPN.2016.2631944","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSIPN.2016.2631944","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8010473","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752972","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convergence of Distributed Flooding and Its Application for Distributed Bayesian Filtering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peer-to-peer computing","Convergence","Protocols","Information processing","Bayes methods","Information management","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information theory","nonlinear filters","peer-to-peer computing","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information sharing method","peer-to-peer communication","finite sets","distributed set-theoretic information flooding","DSIF protocol","distributed nonlinear Bayesian filtering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Consensus","diffusion","distributed tracking","particle filter","sensor network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752972/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Convergence of Distributed Flooding and Its Application for Distributed Bayesian Filtering","volume":"3","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7752972/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17139355","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Marie Skodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship","grantNumber":"H2020-MSCA-IF-2015"},{"fundingName":"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under Torres Quevedo","grantNumber":"PTQ-14-06928"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convergence of Distributed Flooding and Its Application for Distributed Bayesian Filtering","sourcePdf":"tsipn-li-2631944-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.18909S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6884276","isNumber":"8010473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6884276","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8010473","articleId":"7752972","onlineDate":"22 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7752973,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Zhang","affiliation":["Center for Cyber Security, School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/7782442/7752973/yzhan-2631951-small.gif","p":["Yuan Zhang (S\u201916) received the B.Sc. degree from the University of Electronic Science Technology of China, China, in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Computer Science and Engineering.

However, unlike using local storage devices, users do not physically manage the data stored on cloud servers; therefore, the data integrity of the outsourced data has become an issue. Many public verification schemes have been proposed to enable a third-party auditor to verify the data integrity for users. These schemes make an impractical assumption-the auditors have enough computation capability to bear expensive verification costs. In this paper, we propose a novel public verification scheme for the cloud storage using indistinguishability obfuscation, which requires a lightweight computation on the auditor and the delegate most computation to the cloud. We further extend our scheme to support batch verification and data dynamic operations, where multiple verification tasks from different users can be performed efficiently by the auditor and the cloud-stored data can be updated dynamically. Compared with other existing works, our scheme significantly reduces the auditor's computation overhead. Moreover, the batch verification overhead on the auditor side in our scheme is independent of the number of verification tasks. Our scheme could be practical in a scenario, where the data integrity verifications are executed frequently, and the number of verification tasks (i.e., the number of users) is numerous; even if the auditor is equipped with a low-power device, it can verify the data integrity efficiently. We prove the security of our scheme under the strongest security model proposed by Shi et al. (ACM CCS 2013). Finally, we conduct a performance analysis to demonstrate that our scheme is more efficient than other existing works in terms of the auditor's communication and computation efficiency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Public Verification of Data Integrity for Cloud Storage Systems from Indistinguishability Obfuscation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2016.2631951","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7782442/07752973.pdf","startPage":"676","endPage":"688","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2016.2631951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7782442","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752973","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752973/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Public Verification of Data Integrity for Cloud Storage Systems from Indistinguishability Obfuscation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7752973/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16596035","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61370203, 61472065 and 61350110238"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology on Communication Security Laboratory Foundation","grantNumber":"9140C110301110C1103"},{"fundingName":"International Science and Technology Co-operation and Exchange Program of Sichuan Province, China","grantNumber":"2014HH0029"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014M552336"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Public Verification of Data Integrity for Cloud Storage Systems from Indistinguishability Obfuscation","sourcePdf":"tifs-zhang-2631951-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120216S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7782442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"7782442","articleId":"7752973","onlineDate":"22 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7752983,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Morstyn","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/8388565/7752983/morst-2631600-small.gif","p":["Thomas Morstyn (S\u201913) received the B.E.

The proposed control strategy uses a convex formulation of the ac DOPF problem developed from a d-q reference frame voltage-current model and linear power flow approximations. The convex DOPF problem is divided between autonomous agents and solved based on local information and neighbour-to-neighbour communication over a sparse communication network, using a distributed primal subgradient algorithm. Each agent is only required to solve convex quadratic sub-problems, for which robust and efficient solvers exist, making the control strategy suitable for receding horizon model predictive control. Also, the agent sub-problems require limited power network information and include only a subset of the centralised optimisation problem decision variables and constraints, providing scalability and data privacy. Unlike existing distributed optimal power flow methods, such as alternating direction method of multipliers, under the proposed control strategy the information required by each agent is independent of the communication network topology, providing increased flexibility and robustness. The performance of the proposed control strategy was verified for an ac microgrid with distributed lead-acid batteries and intermittent photovoltaic generation, using an RTDS Technologies real-time digital simulator.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388565","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/8388565/07752983.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2016.2631600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2016.2631600","startPage":"3419","endPage":"3429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network Topology Independent Multi-Agent Dynamic Optimal Power Flow for Microgrids With Distributed Energy Storage Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7752983/","displayDocTitle":"Network Topology Independent Multi-Agent Dynamic Optimal Power Flow for Microgrids With Distributed Energy Storage Systems","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7752983/","volume":"9","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"17857436","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2018","publicationDate":"July 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network Topology Independent Multi-Agent Dynamic Optimal Power Flow for Microgrids With Distributed Energy Storage Systems","sourcePdf":"tsg-morstyn-2631600-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082108S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8388565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8388565","articleId":"7752983","onlineDate":"22 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7752984,"authors":[{"name":"Qiqin Dai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/7763897/7752984/dai-2631339-small.gif","p":["Qiqin Dai received the B.S. degree in automation from Zhejiang University, China, in 2012.

Optimal trajectory control (OTC) has been proven to be the most effective control method to optimize energy delivery with given stresses. This paper proposes a method to implement soft start-up and short-circuit protection for LLC converters by using low-cost microcontrollers (MCUs) with minimum stresses and optimal energy delivery. Our current understanding of the relationship between the switching frequency and the output voltage is based on the state-plane analysis, and the requirement for the controllers is significantly reduced when using the lookup table. Further improvement enables the application of the proposed control method to high-frequency LLC converters without increasing the cost for the controllers. This paper proposes a method to protect the LLC converter from abrupt short-circuit with low-cost MCUs, which improves transient response to short-circuit significantly, and investigates limitations when operating the high-frequency LLC converter under short-circuit conditions. The proposed methods minimize the CPU resource requirement and can be further integrated with other state-trajectory control functions within one MCU.

This drive principally suffers from two problems namely: the circulation of zero sequence current in motor phases and overcharging of the lower dc-link capacitor by its counterpart with higher dc-link voltage. It has been reported earlier, that the decoupled space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) control strategies avoid both of these problems. This paper proposes an improvised SVPWM scheme that achieves a better harmonic performance compared to the decoupled SVPWM scheme without altering either the power circuit configuration or the voltage ratings of the devices. The proposed PWM strategy clamps the inverter with lower dc-link voltage with an active state, while the other inverter is switched around it.

The main challenges faced by DIMA system architects are related to functions allocation and device physical allocation. This problem refers to the system functions translation into tasks and further hardware allocation. These problems are hard to solve manually due to the high number of functions in modern systems. The design and development of DIMA systems can be dramatically improved using optimization techniques. Moreover, allocation strategies based on different figure of merit can be evaluated at a smaller cost. In this paper we develop a simplified DIMA model using the Capella tool and the framework ARCADIA. The model is extended using viewpoints for specifying additional system constraints. Model parameters are extracted to specify a binary integer problem for the system allocation process automation.

This operation is both memory bound and latency sensitive, as it (1) exhibits irregular access patterns that cause frequent cache and TLB misses, and (2) requires the data from every memory access to be sent back to the CPU to determine the next pointer to access. Our goal is to accelerate pointer chasing by performing it inside main memory, thereby avoiding inefficient and high-latency data transfers between main memory and the CPU. To this end, we propose the In-Memory PoInter Chasing Accelerator (IMPICA), which leverages the logic layer within 3D-stacked memory for linked data structure traversal. This paper identifies the key design challenges of designing a pointer chasing accelerator in memory, describes new mechanisms employed within IMPICA to solve these challenges, and evaluates the performance and energy benefits of our accelerator. IMPICA addresses the key challenges of (1) how to achieve high parallelism in the presence of serial accesses in pointer chasing, and (2) how to effectively perform virtual-to-physical address translation on the memory side without requiring expensive accesses to the CPU's memory management unit. We show that the solutions to these challenges, address-access decoupling and a region-based page table, respectively, are simple and low-cost. We believe these solutions are also applicable to many other in-memory accelerators, which are likely to also face the two challenges. Our evaluations on a quad-core system show that IMPICA improves the performance of pointer chasing operations in three commonly-used linked data structures (linked lists, hash tables, and B-trees) by 92%, 29%, and 18%, respectively. This leads to a significant performance improvement in applications that utilize linked data structures - on a real database application, DBx1000, IMPICA improves transaction throughput and response time by 16% and 13%, respectively. IMPICA also significantly reduces overall system energy consumption (by 41%, 23%, and 10% for the three commonly-used data structures, and by 6% for DBx1000).","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2016.7753257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2016.7753257","startPage":"25","endPage":"32","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 34th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 34th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742853/7753252/07753257.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating pointer chasing in 3D-stacked memory: Challenges, mechanisms, evaluation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7753257/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating pointer chasing in 3D-stacked memory: Challenges, mechanisms, evaluation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16489171","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7753257/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating pointer chasing in 3D-stacked memory: Challenges, mechanisms, evaluation","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.22808S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7742853","isNumber":"7753252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7742853","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"7753252","articleId":"7753257","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7753259,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Ting J.

We also use our models to accurately predict iso-performance Pareto frontiers of utilization, aspect ratio and number of layers in the back-end-of-line (BEOL) stack. Furthermore, using data mining and machine learning techniques, we develop new methodologies to generate training examples given very few placements. We conduct validation experiments in three foundry technologies (28nm FDSOI, 28nm LP and 45nm GS), and demonstrate accuracy \u2265 85.9% in predicting routability of a placement. Our predictions of Pareto frontiers in the three technologies are pessimistic by at most 2% with respect to the maximum achievable utilization for a given design in a given BEOL stack.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2016.7753259","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 34th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 34th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742853/7753252/07753259.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2016.7753259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753252","startPage":"41","endPage":"48","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BEOL stack-aware routability prediction from placement using data mining techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7753259","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"BEOL stack-aware routability prediction from placement using data mining techniques","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7753259/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16498783","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7753259/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BEOL stack-aware routability prediction from placement using data mining techniques","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"383.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107812S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7742853","isNumber":"7753252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7742853","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7753252","articleId":"7753259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7753260,"authors":[{"name":"Hasan Erdem Yant\u0131r","affiliation":["Center for Embedded and Cyber-Physical Systems, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hasan Erdem","lastName":"Yant\u0131r","id":"37076597700"},{"name":"Mohammed E.

SC has many appealing features such as error tolerance, low power, and low area cost. However, it suffers from severe accuracy loss due to correlation or insufficient randomness. SNs can be decorrelated by regenerating them from independent random sources. This is the preferred decorrelation method mentioned in the literature, but it often entails huge area and delay overhead. An attractive alternative is isolation-based decorrelation, which is the focus of this research. Isolation works by inserting delays (isolators) into a stochastic circuit to eliminate undesirable interactions among its SNs. Surprisingly, although it has far lower cost than regeneration, isolation has not been studied systematically before, hindering its practical use. The paper first examines the basic characteristics of SC isolation. We show that unless carefully used, it can result in excessive isolator numbers or unexpectedly corrupt a circuit's function. We therefore formally characterize the behavior of an isolation-decorrelated circuit, and derive conditions for correct deployment of isolators. We then describe the first isolator placement algorithm designed to minimize the number of isolators. Finally, we present supporting data obtained from simulation experiments on representative circuits.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2016.7753265","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 34th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 34th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742853/7753252/07753265.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2016.7753265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753252","startPage":"88","endPage":"95","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Isolation-based decorrelation of stochastic circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7753265","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Isolation-based decorrelation of stochastic circuits","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7753265/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16498800","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7753265/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Isolation-based decorrelation of stochastic circuits","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0721S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7742853","isNumber":"7753252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7742853","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7753252","articleId":"7753265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7753266,"authors":[{"name":"Yesung Kang","affiliation":["Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, Korea"],"firstName":"Yesung","lastName":"Kang","id":"37086054368"},{"name":"Jaewoo Kim","affiliation":["Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, Korea"],"firstName":"Jaewoo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086056940"},{"name":"Seokhyeong Kang","affiliation":["Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, Korea"],"firstName":"Seokhyeong","lastName":"Kang","id":"37086049444"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5142-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5143-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7753266","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":296},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7753266","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filters","Adders","Generators","Approximate computing","Power demand","Approximation algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","FIR filters","low-power electronics","power consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximate synthesis flow","energy-efficient FIR filter","computing systems","power consumption","energy efficiency","finite impulse response filter","common subexpression elimination algorithm"]}],"abstract":"The portability of emerging computing systems demands further reduction in the power consumption of their components.

Previous approaches to core and DRAM power management using DVFS used performance, specifically acceptable performance loss, as a constraint. We present energy management algorithms that coordinate core and DRAM frequency scaling under a specified energy budget. Approaches that work under performance constraints, as we will show, are not directly applicable to systems operating under energy constraints, as it is difficult to calculate the correct performance bounds in real-time to stay under an energy budget. Setting arbitrary energy budgets for a diverse set of applications can be harmful to application performance. We use the previously introduced concept of Inefficiency - the additional amount of energy above the minimum required energy that can be used to improve performance - to provide a dynamic energy constraint to our system. We introduce new power management algorithms that search the power and performance space to find the best performing point under this constraint. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms using CPU DVFS and DRAM frequency scaling.

Using these features we apply a logistic regression (LR) method to construct a predictive model trained and tested using three datasets: random, Sobel filter and Gaussian filter. We classify dynamic delay into five distinct classes. For a given test input, WILD predicts the class of output dynamic delay.

At the same time, industry is exploring many new memory technologies that require new manufacturing processes. In such challenging fabrication regimes, parameter variation (PV) and yield will be important problems. While many recent bodies of work have targeted PV in processors, few have targeted PV in the memory system. Mitigation techniques have either focused on refresh, or have focused on inter-die variation. In this work, with empirical measurements, we first show that PV and specifically intra-die PV is indeed a real phenomenon in modern DRAM chips. We show that this intra-die PV can impact timing parameters for different banks within a DRAM chip. In response to growing PV, memory timing parameters will likely be set very conservatively to accommodate the worst case. To overcome these worst-case limitations, we propose the design of a reconfigurable memory module that detects PV in the field and organizes the memory system into fast/slow regions. This requires changes to the memory controller and to buffer chips on DIMMs. Further, OS migration policies can move frequently accessed pages to the fast regions. This overall approach not only improves performance and energy, it also provides a configurable platform for systems that can tolerate errors or approximation. The proposed system yields an average performance improvement of 12.6% in DRAM systems, and 25.5% in NVM systems.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2016.7753283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2016.7753283","startPage":"217","endPage":"224","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 34th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 34th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742853/7753252/07753283.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding and alleviating intra-die and intra-DIMM parameter variation in the memory system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7753283/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Understanding and alleviating intra-die and intra-DIMM parameter variation in the memory system","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16498774","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7753283/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding and alleviating intra-die and intra-DIMM parameter variation in the memory system","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"098.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071873S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7742853","isNumber":"7753252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7742853","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7753252","articleId":"7753283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":7753284,"authors":[{"name":"Taizhi Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA"],"firstName":"Taizhi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085436076"},{"name":"Chang-Chih Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA"],"firstName":"Chang-Chih","lastName":"Chen","id":"38466562000"},{"name":"Jiadong Wu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA"],"firstName":"Jiadong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086210888"},{"name":"Linda Milor","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA"],"firstName":"Linda","lastName":"Milor","id":"37344775200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5142-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5143-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7753284","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":414},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7753284","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Human computer interaction","Transistors","Microprocessors","Reliability","Stress","SRAM cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit stability","failure analysis","hot carriers","integrated circuit reliability","microprocessor chips","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SRAM stability analysis","cache configurations","bias temperature instability","hot carrier injection","transistor threshold voltage","performance degradations","wearout mechanisms","SRAM cells","first-level cache","microprocessor performance","cache lifetimes","failure probability","LEON3 microprocessor","performance-reliability tradeoffs","cache designers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cache reliability","Bias Temperature Instability","Hot Carrier Injection","Associativity","Cache Line Size","Replacement Algorithms","Error Correcting Codes"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2016.7753284","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 34th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 34th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742853/7753252/07753284.pdf","startPage":"225","endPage":"232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2016.7753284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SRAM stability analysis for different cache configurations due to Bias Temperature Instability and Hot Carrier Injection","abstract":"Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) and Hot Carrier Injections (HCI) are two of the main effects that increase a transistor's threshold voltage and further cause performance degradations.

In this paper, we explore OpenCL code optimizations for stencil computations on FPGAs. We propose tuning processes for stencil kernels in both the Single-Task and NDRange modes.

The general trend is toward creating deep pipelining and in-order execution of many OpenCL threads across a shared data-path. While this can be a very effective approach for regular kernels, its efficiency significantly diminishes for irregular kernels with runtime-dependent control flow. We need to look for new approaches to improve execution efficiency of FPGAs when targeting irregular OpenCL kernels. This paper proposes a novel solution, called Hardware Thread Reordering (HTR), to boost the throughput of the FPGAs when executing irregular kernels possessing non-deterministic runtime control flow. The key insight of HRT is out-of-order OpenCL thread execution over a shared data-path to achieve significantly higher throughput. The thread reordering is performed at a basic-block level granularity. The synthesized basic-blocks are extended with independent pipeline control signals and context registers to bypass the live values of reordered threads. We demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed solution on three parallel irregular kernels. For the experiments, we utilize the LegUp tool to compare the baseline (in-order) data-path with HTR-enhanced data-path. Our RTL simulation results demonstrate that HTR-enhanced data-path achieves up to 11\u00d7 increase in kernels throughput at a very low overhead (less than 2\u00d7 increase in FPGA resources).","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2016.7753288","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 34th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 34th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742853/7753252/07753288.pdf","startPage":"257","endPage":"264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2016.7753288","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware thread reordering to boost OpenCL throughput on FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hardware thread reordering to boost OpenCL throughput on FPGAs","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16489172","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7753288/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7753288/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware thread reordering to boost OpenCL throughput on FPGAs","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"230.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071191S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7742853","isNumber":"7753252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7742853","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7753252","articleId":"7753288","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7753290,"authors":[{"name":"Satendra Kumar","affiliation":["Dept. of CSE, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Satendra","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37086160520"},{"name":"Ankur Gupta","affiliation":["Dept. of CSE, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Ankur","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37086016406"},{"name":"Sudip Roy","affiliation":["Dept. of CSE, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Sudip","lastName":"Roy","id":"37853240600"},{"name":"Bhargab B.

The scheduling scheme has been combined with all existing mixing algorithms, namely MinMix, RMA, MTCS and CoDOS to analyze its performance.

With this goal in mind, not only deployment of main memories with new technologies are necessary, but also adopting innovative solutions for addressing newfound challenges must be considered as a priority. Recently, phase change memory (PCM) appeared as a preferred candidate for substituting DRAM. PCM with non-volatility, low static power consumption and storing multiple level cells (MLC) capability has opened a new way to the future of memories. Although PCM presents considerable potentials, its short lifetime is a critical concern. Worse still, adopting multiple bits per cell capability degrades the lifetime of PCM more quickly. Hence, convincing the industry for massive production of PCM needs effective and pragmatic solutions. In this paper, we extend the lifetime of a MLC PCM main memory by relying on two strategies: postponing the occurrence of stuck-at failures, and effectively tolerating hard errors. Our scheme postpones the occurrence of hard errors by converting blocks from MLC to SLC mode using byte-level compression. Employing some pointers, the proposed method attempts to cover hard errors by fitting a compressed block either in its physical line location or elsewhere in the page. Full-system and statistical evaluation of the proposed solution shows 48% lifetime improvement of the memory system along with 9% IPC improvement, compared to a state-of-the-art design.","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 34th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 34th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742853/7753252/07753294.pdf","startPage":"304","endPage":"311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tolerating more hard errors in MLC PCMs using compression","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2016.7753294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2016.7753294","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7753294","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7753294/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Tolerating more hard errors in MLC PCMs using compression","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16498809","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7753294/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tolerating more hard errors in MLC PCMs using compression","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"320.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093854S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7742853","isNumber":"7753252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7742853","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7753252","articleId":"7753294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7753296,"authors":[{"name":"Xushen Han","affiliation":["Production and Systems, Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Xushen","lastName":"Han","id":"37086153518"},{"name":"Dajiang Zhou","affiliation":["Production and Systems, Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Dajiang","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37403106700"},{"name":"Shihao Wang","affiliation":["Production and Systems, Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Shihao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085390798"},{"name":"Shinji Kimura","affiliation":["Production and Systems, Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinji","lastName":"Kimura","id":"37280805400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5142-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5143-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7753296","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1468},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Bandwidth","Memory management","Throughput","Field programmable gate arrays","Backpropagation","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","field programmable gate arrays","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CNN-MERP","FPGA-based memory-efficient reconfigurable processor","forward and backward propagation","convolutional neural networks","machine learning applications","VLSI chips","ASIC","external memory bandwidth","VLSI solutions","memory hierarchy","bandwidth requirements","data flow optimization","data reuse","control logic","multiboot feature","DRAM bandwidth","Vertex UltraScale platform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["convolutional neural networks","FPGA","memory bandwidth","reconfigurable processor","backward propagation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2016.7753296","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7753296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2016.7753296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753252","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 34th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 34th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742853/7753252/07753296.pdf","startPage":"320","endPage":"327","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CNN-MERP: An FPGA-based memory-efficient reconfigurable processor for forward and backward propagation of convolutional neural networks","abstract":"Large-scale deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used in machine learning applications. While CNNs involve huge complexity, VLSI (ASIC and FPGA) chips that deliver high-density integration of computational resources are regarded as a promising platform for CNN's implementation. At massive parallelism of computational units, however, the external memory bandwidth, which is constrained by the pin count of the VLSI chip, becomes the system bottleneck. Moreover, VLSI solutions are usually regarded as a lack of the flexibility to be reconfigured for the various parameters of CNNs. This paper presents CNN-MERP to address these issues. CNN-MERP incorporates an efficient memory hierarchy that significantly reduces the bandwidth requirements from multiple optimizations including on/off-chip data allocation, data flow optimization and data reuse. The proposed 2-level reconfigurability is utilized to enable fast and efficient reconfiguration, which is based on the control logic and the multiboot feature of FPGA. As a result, an external memory bandwidth requirement of 1.94MB/GFlop is achieved, which is 55% lower than prior arts. Under limited DRAM bandwidth, a system throughput of 1244GFlop/s is achieved at the Vertex UltraScale platform, which is 5.48 times higher than the state-of-the-art FPGA implementations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7753296/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16489159","htmlLink":"/document/7753296/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"CNN-MERP: An FPGA-based memory-efficient reconfigurable processor for forward and backward propagation of convolutional neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CNN-MERP: An FPGA-based memory-efficient reconfigurable processor for forward and backward propagation of convolutional neural networks","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093126S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7742853","isNumber":"7753252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7742853","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7753252","articleId":"7753296","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7753297,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Wang","affiliation":["University of Virginia"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37600183800"},{"name":"Kevin Skadron","affiliation":["University of Virginia"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Skadron","id":"37085415957"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5142-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5143-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7753297","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"abstract":"We propose Lumos+, an analytical framework for power and performance modeling of accelerator-rich heterogeneous architectures.

The objective of this paper is to address the limits of integrating STT-RAM in 3D chip stacks from a thermal perspective and propose a novel stacking structure that minimizes heat-induced problems. Specifically, we analyze the system-level impact of increased temperatures and propose a novel technique to dynamically adjust the flow rate of the liquid interlayer cooling at run time to reduce the STT-RAM temperature and alleviate temperature-induced problems that cause the performance degradation and prevent overcooling the STT-RAM die and minimize the pump energy consumption.

Based on our proposed error model, we conduct extensive experiments on real MRAM devices in different temperatures and magnetic fields. Our results show that MRAM lifetime for the chips we tested is demonstrated infinite under normal operation environment. The critical temperature is 75\u00b0C and the dominant error type is read error. In contrast, write error is more seriously than read error in magnetic environment.

However, SRAM-based FPGAs suffer from high power consumption, prolonged boot delays (due to the volatility of the configuration bits), and a significant area overhead (due to the use of 5T SRAM cells for the configuration bits). Floating gate (flash) based FPGAs can avert these problems. This paper presents a study of flash-based FPGA designs (both static and dynamic), and presents the tradeoff of delay, power dissipation and energy consumption of the various designs. Our work differs from previously proposed flash-based FPGAs, since we embed the flash transistors (which store the configuration bits) directly within the logic and interconnect fabrics. We also present a detailed description of how the programming of the configuration bits is accomplished. Our delay and power estimates are derived from circuit level simulations. Our proposed static flash-based LUT structure yields 10% faster operation, 12% lower dynamic power dissipation, 21% lower energy consumption and 29% lower static power dissipation compared to a traditional SRAM-based LUT. We also show that, for high performance applications, a dynamic flash-based LUT can achieve further performance improvements (32% lower delay) with higher energy consumption (37% higher) compared to an SRAM-based LUT. We also show that a flash-based interconnect structure provides 89% lower delay and 71% lower overall power consumption compared to the traditional interconnect structure used in SRAM-based FPGAs.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2016.7753317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2016.7753317","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 34th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 34th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742853/7753252/07753317.pdf","startPage":"416","endPage":"419","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753252","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7753317/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Exploring static and dynamic flash-based FPGA design topologies","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16498831","htmlLink":"/document/7753317/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring static and dynamic flash-based FPGA design topologies","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"251.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074445S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7742853","isNumber":"7753252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7742853","xplore-issue":"7753252","articleId":"7753317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7753318,"authors":[{"name":"Santiago Bock","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh"],"firstName":"Santiago","lastName":"Bock","id":"37391294300"},{"name":"Bruce R.

Network requests generated by different applications running on different cores can interfere with each other, leading to a slowdown in performance of each application. The degree of slowdown introduced by this interference varies for each application, as it depends on (1) the sensitivity of the application to NoC performance, and (2) network traffic induced by other applications running concurrently on the system. In modern systems, NoC interference is largely uncontrolled, and therefore some applications unfairly slow down much more than others. This can lead to overall system performance degradation, prevent fair progress of different applications, and cause starvation of unfairly-treated applications. Our goal is to accurately model the slowdown of each application executing on the system due to NoC interference at runtime, and to use this information to improve system performance and reduce unfairness. To this end, we propose the NoC Application Slowdown (NAS) Model, the first online model that accurately estimates how much network delays due to interference contribute to the overall stall time of each application. The key idea of NAS is to determine how the delays induced at each level of network data transmission overlap with each other, and to use the overlap information to calculate the net impact of the delays on application stall time. Our model determines the application slowdowns at runtime with a very low error rate, averaging 4.2% over 90 multiprogrammed workloads for an 8\u00d78 mesh network. We use NAS to develop Fairness-Aware Source Throttling (FAST), a mechanism that employs slowdown predictions to control the network injection rates of applications in a way that minimizes system unfairness. Our results over a variety of multiprogrammed workloads show that FAST improves average system fairness and performance by 9.5% and 5.2%, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7753327/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16498833","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7753327/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A model for Application Slowdown Estimation in on-chip networks and its use for improving system fairness and performance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model for Application Slowdown Estimation in on-chip networks and its use for improving system fairness and performance","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101478S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7742853","isNumber":"7753252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7742853","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7753252","articleId":"7753327","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-26"},{"_id":7753332,"authors":[{"name":"Na Gong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND, USA"],"firstName":"Na","lastName":"Gong","id":"37392894300"},{"name":"Jonathon Edstrom","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND, USA"],"firstName":"Jonathon","lastName":"Edstrom","id":"37085857082"},{"name":"Dongliang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND, USA"],"firstName":"Dongliang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085724733"},{"name":"Jinhui Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND, USA"],"firstName":"Jinhui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085863529"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5142-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5143-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7753332","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":204},"abstract":"The growing popularity of powerful mobile devices such as smart phones and tablet devices has resulted in the exponential growth of demand for video applications. However, due to the intensive computation of the video decoding process, mobile video applications require frequent embedded memory access, which consumes a large amount of power and limits battery life. Various low-voltage memory techniques have been investigated to enhance the energy efficiency of multimedia processing system. Unfortunately, the existing research suffers from high implementation complexity and large area overhead. In this paper, we present a low-cost self-recovery video storage system by investigating meaningful data patterns hidden in mobile video data. Specifically, we propose a two-dimensional data-pattern approach to explore horizontal data-association and vertical data-correlation characteristics. Based on the identified optimal data patterns, we present a simple circuit-level SRAM design to enable self-recovery at low voltages.

By boosting the wordline and select signal voltage, this bitcell can read and write with no error at 300 mV while data can be held down to 250 mV in standby mode. Bitline leakage suppression in 12T bitcell allows more bitcells per bitline for high density SRAMs and provides faster read operation.

Large-scale applications using DCNN mainly operate in high-performance server clusters, GPUs or FPGA clusters; it is restricted to extend the applications onto mobile/wearable devices and Internet-of-Things (IoT) entities due to high power/energy consumption. Stochastic Computing is a promising method to overcome this shortcoming used in specific hardware-based systems. Many complex arithmetic operations can be implemented with very simple hardware logic in the SC framework, which alleviates the extensive computation complexity. The exploration of network-wise optimization and the revision of network structure with respect to stochastic computing based hardware design have not been discussed in previous work. In this paper, we investigate Deep Stochastic Convolutional Neural Network (DSCNN) for DCNN using stochastic computing. The essential calculation components using SC are designed and evaluated. We propose a joint optimization method to collaborate components guaranteeing a high calculation accuracy in each stage of the network. The structure of original DSCNN is revised to accommodate SC hardware design's simplicity. Experimental Results show that as opposed to software inspired feature extraction block in DSCNN, an optimized hardware oriented feature extraction block achieves as higher as 59.27% calculation precision. And the optimized DSCNN can achieve only 3.48% network test error rate compared to 27.83% for baseline DSCNN using software inspired feature extraction block.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7753357/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16489182","htmlLink":"/document/7753357/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"DSCNN: Hardware-oriented optimization for Stochastic Computing based Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DSCNN: Hardware-oriented optimization for Stochastic Computing based Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"405.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058803S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7742853","isNumber":"7753252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7742853","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7753252","articleId":"7753357","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7753446,"authors":[{"name":"Nihel Ramdhan","affiliation":["Communication Networks and Security Research Lab, University of Carthage, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Nihel","lastName":"Ramdhan","id":"37086205144"},{"name":"Maha Sliti","affiliation":["Communication Networks and Security Research Lab, University of Carthage, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Maha","lastName":"Sliti","id":"37320336200"},{"name":"Noureddine Boudriga","affiliation":["Communication Networks and Security Research Lab, University of Carthage, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Noureddine","lastName":"Boudriga","id":"37272059200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3784-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3783-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3785-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1949-4106"}],"articleNumber":"7753446","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":256},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7753446","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical sensors","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","free-space optical communication","protocols","tree codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codeword-based data collection protocol","optical unmanned aerial vehicle networks","FSO communication","free space optics","optical UAVs networks","hierarchical optical codewords","collection node"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","Free Space Optical links","Optical Code-Division Multiple-Access System","Optical codewords"]}],"abstract":"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are a possible future application for both civil and military use.

However, limited channel capacity and battery life of sensors are the main design challenges in WSNs. The use of cooperative multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology is one of the most promising techniques that can enhance the channel capacity and reduce transmission energy in WSNs. In this paper, we propose an adaptive MIMO singular value decomposition (SVD) method in order to enhance the channel capacity of WSNs, in the case of imperfect channel state information (CSI). The SVD is conditioned to provide efficient space-time precoding/decoding with the use of either least square (LS) or minimum mean-square error (MMSE) filtering. Channel capacity is improved yet further by way of optimized power allocation, via a water filling strategy. The bit error rate (BER) and channel capacity performances of the encoding methods are evaluated for Rayleigh fading channels. Our simulation results show that the adaptive MIMO-SVD technique works best with MMSE channel estimation for cooperative MIMO in WSNs.","doi":"10.1109/HONET.2016.7753449","publicationTitle":"2016 HONET-ICT","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 HONET-ICT","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742833/7753413/07753449.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HONET.2016.7753449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753413","startPage":"49","endPage":"53","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel capacity improvement for cooperative MIMO wireless sensor networks via adaptive MIMO-SVD","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7753449","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Channel capacity improvement for cooperative MIMO wireless sensor networks via adaptive MIMO-SVD","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7753449/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-14 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16498767","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7753449/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel capacity improvement for cooperative MIMO wireless sensor networks via adaptive MIMO-SVD","confLoc":"Nicosia, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"paper8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069474S","chronDate":"13-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7742833","isNumber":"7753413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7742833","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7753413","articleId":"7753449","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7753473,"authors":[{"name":"Dobromir Petkov Dobrev","affiliation":["Institute of Biophysics and Biomedical Engineering, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Dobromir Petkov","lastName":"Dobrev","id":"37086203278"},{"name":"Tatyana Dimitrova Neycheva","affiliation":["Institute of Biophysics and Biomedical Engineering, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Tatyana Dimitrova","lastName":"Neycheva","id":"37086210987"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2883-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-2881-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2884-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7753473","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"abstract":"Power-line interference (PLI) is a major disturbing factor in almost all groundfree biosignal acquisition applications. The main cause of interference is body to amplifier Wheatstone bridge imbalance. The bridge is formed from electrode impedances and the amplifier common mode input impedances. Because the electrode impedances vary with time, the Wheatstone bridge tends to be imbalanced, and produces differential PLI which is amplified together with the useful signal. The interference can be canceled only when the bridge is kept continuously in balanced conditions. It was shown how the Wheatstone bridge can be adjusted to maintain balanced conditions by means of two digital synchronous demodulators. For proper demodulation, an accurate synchronization with PLI is needed. Recently, dedicated software PLL (SPLL) for PLI synchronization was developed implemented and tested. This paper presents a complete impedance balancing approach wherein synchronization to PLI is done with the designed SPLL. The stability of the whole system is proven by Matlab mixed signal simulations. The presented approach is applicable in various two-electrode applications, such as Holter monitors, external defibrillators, ECG monitors and other heart beat sensing biomedical devices.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance","Interference","Bridge circuits","Electrodes","Synchronization","MATLAB"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","biomedical electrodes","defibrillators","demodulators","electrocardiography","patient monitoring","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic common mode electrode-amplifier impedance balance","SPLL synchronization","power-line interference","Wheatstone bridge","synchronous demodulators","Holter monitors","external defibrillators","ECG monitors","heart beat sensing biomedical devices"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wheatstone bridge","Power-line interference","Lock-in demodulator","Synchronous detection","Software PLL"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ET.2016.7753473","publicationTitle":"2016 XXV International Scientific Conference Electronics (ET)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 XXV International Scientific Conference Electronics (ET)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742753/7753452/07753473.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753452","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ET.2016.7753473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic common mode electrode-amplifier impedance balance with SPLL synchronization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7753473","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automatic common mode electrode-amplifier impedance balance with SPLL synchronization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7753473/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7753473/","accessionNumber":"16498739","conferenceDate":"12-14 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Sept. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic common mode electrode-amplifier impedance balance with SPLL synchronization","confLoc":"Sozopol, Bulgaria","sourcePdf":"Dobrev_2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044429S","chronDate":"12-14 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7742753","isNumber":"7753452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7742753","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7753452","articleId":"7753473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7753475,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolay Tinkov Dukov","affiliation":["Applied Signal Processing Laboratory, Technical University of Varna, Varna, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Nikolay Tinkov","lastName":"Dukov","id":"37086206550"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2883-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-2881-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2884-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7753475","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"abstract":"Hardware implementation of machine learning methods is often considered challenging, however, it brings major benefits, such as speed of operation and energy efficiency.

We report results of a comparative evaluation of these PDEs for three different sizes of the PNN, evaluated in a common experimental protocol that makes use of the SPECT dataset.

Compared with battery, energy harvesting is a better power source for these wearable devices due to many advantages. However, harvested energy is naturally unstable and program execution will be interrupted frequently. Nonvolatile processor (NVP) demonstrates promising advantages to back up volatile state before the system energy is depleted. Due to the backup and resumption procedures resulted from frequent power failures, non-volatile processor exhibits different characteristics from traditional processors, necessitating a set of adaptive design and optimization strategies. Recently, there have been both hardware and software researches aiming to develop correct and efficient non-volatile processors.

Guided image filter is one of the widely used image filters. Among them, the gradient domain guided image filter for edge-preserving smoothing and for mitigating the halo-artifacts problem existed in the current guided image filters is reported recently. Due to its computation complexity and the requirement of global pixel values in the computation, there is no existing VLSI implementation of gradient domain guided image filter. This paper presents such a VLSI architecture incorporated with techniques to reduce computation complexity and increase processing throughput. Subsampling technique is adopted in the design to save computation cost in terms of size and power consumption, without visually hampering the filtering result. Parallel structure is used at the output stage to restore the full image size and to achieve high throughput. Based on the STM 90-nm CMOS technology, the synthesis result shows that the proposed architecture is able to support Full-HD (1920 \u00d7 1080) image filtering at a throughput above 60 frame/s, with a design area of 726671.6\u03bcm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n and power consumption of 9.85mW.

Because of the large number of Base Station (BS) antennas as well as the multiple User Terminals (UTs) served in a massive MIMO system, the channel matrix dimensions become larger. Inversions of such large matrices using direct inversion methods, such as used in linear pre-coders like Zero Forcing (ZF), would entail prohibitive complexity. For avoiding such complexity, Neumann series based approximate inversion has been suggested for linear pre-coders in massive MIMO systems. However the performance, complexity and convergence speed of the Neumann series approach depends very much on the initial approximation of the inverse used as a starting point. In this work, we present a novel initial approximation for the Neumann series which facilitates the parallel computation of the inverse and hence results in lower latency for inversion as well as better accuracy when compared to the previous approaches. A VLSI architecture of the proposed method is implemented for the inversion of a 16 \u00d7 16 matrix, in TSMC 65nm technology. A throughput of 0.54M to 15M matrix inversion per sec is achieved at a clock frequency of 460MHz with a 117K gate count.","doi":"10.1109/VLSI-SoC.2016.7753561","publicationTitle":"2016 IFIP/IEEE International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI-SoC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IFIP/IEEE International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI-SoC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7744451/7753408/07753561.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSI-SoC.2016.7753561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-latency approximate matrix inversion for high-throughput linear pre-coders in massive MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7753561","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7753561/","displayDocTitle":"Low-latency approximate matrix inversion for high-throughput linear pre-coders in massive MIMO","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16499160","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7753561/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-latency approximate matrix inversion for high-throughput linear pre-coders in massive MIMO","confLoc":"Tallinn, Estonia","sourcePdf":"VLSI-SoC_2016_paper_3a-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060447S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7744451","isNumber":"7753408","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7744451","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7753408","articleId":"7753561","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7753564,"authors":[{"name":"Elad Amrani","affiliation":["Andrew & Erna Viterbi Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Elad","lastName":"Amrani","id":"37086201628"},{"name":"Avishay Drori","affiliation":["Andrew & Erna Viterbi Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Avishay","lastName":"Drori","id":"37086209810"},{"name":"Shahar Kvatinsky","affiliation":["Andrew & Erna Viterbi Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Shahar","lastName":"Kvatinsky","id":"37601405900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3561-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3562-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-8440"}],"articleNumber":"7753564","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":263},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7753564","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Memristors","Logic gates","Resistance","Capacitors","Suspensions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic design","logic gates","memristors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic design","unipolar memristors","memory elements","logic operations","OR logic gates","NOT logic gates","logic function","logic computations","unipolar memristive materials"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["memristors","thin film","logic design","unipolar"]}],"abstract":"Memristors are novel devices that could naturally be designed as memory elements.

In small device geometries, a single particle strike might affect multiple adjacent cells in a memory array resulting in a multiple bit upset (MBU). Traditional fault tolerance technologies such as triple modular redundancy (TMR) and error correcting code (ECC) occupy the large area and have vulnerability to MBU. In this research, we propose DMR based error correct circuit and employ a combination of proposed circuit and the interleaving technique to mitigate MBU. In addition, we explain soft error simulator developed to calculate bit interleaving distance. The results show that the area of proposed circuit is the smallest when we compare the proposed circuit, ECC based error correct circuit and TMR. Simulation results show that the interleaving distance which can conceal all MBU patterns is 4.","doi":"10.1109/VLSI-SoC.2016.7753574","publicationTitle":"2016 IFIP/IEEE International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI-SoC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IFIP/IEEE International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI-SoC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7744451/7753408/07753574.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSI-SoC.2016.7753574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel soft error tolerant FPGA architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7753574","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7753574/","displayDocTitle":"A novel soft error tolerant FPGA architecture","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16499166","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7753574/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel soft error tolerant FPGA architecture","confLoc":"Tallinn, Estonia","sourcePdf":"VLSI-SoC_2016_paper_4a-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061698S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7744451","isNumber":"7753408","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7744451","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7753408","articleId":"7753574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7753586,"authors":[{"name":"Huiming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"lastName":"Huiming Chen","id":"37085852250"},{"name":"Wong-Hing Lam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"lastName":"Wong-Hing Lam","id":"37357371900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2708-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2709-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7753586","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Optimization","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","channel estimation","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO communication","Rayleigh channels","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LMMSE","MAP channel estimation","BCRLB training signals","correlated two-way MIMO relay systems","single relay antenna","correlated Rayleigh fading channels","linear minimum mean square estimator","backward channel estimator","asymptotic maximum a posterior method","asymptotic likelihood function"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a two-stage channel estimation scheme for two-way MIMO relay systems with a single relay antenna.

Analysis and simulation result show that, this strategy can guarantee the heterogeneous requirements of heterogeneous SUs and improve the spectrum utilization.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2016.7753590","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753583","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7744430/7753583/07753590.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A spectrum auction strategy for multimedia stream in cognitive radio network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7753590/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7753590/","displayDocTitle":"A spectrum auction strategy for multimedia stream in cognitive radio network","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16499081","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A spectrum auction strategy for multimedia stream in cognitive radio network","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"com01-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053301S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7744430","isNumber":"7753583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7744430","xplore-issue":"7753583","articleId":"7753590","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7753591,"authors":[{"name":"Yanwei Yang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Specialty Fiber Optics and Optical Access Networks, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yanwei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086199699"},{"name":"Feng Hu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Specialty Fiber Optics and Optical Access Networks, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Hu","id":"37086210737"},{"name":"Zhong Jiang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Specialty Fiber Optics and Optical Access Networks, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhong","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37086199029"},{"name":"Chao Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Specialty Fiber Optics and Optical Access Networks, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37715938500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2708-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2709-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7753591","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":345},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Signal detection","Urban areas","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Maximum likelihood detection","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ant colony optimisation","computational complexity","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","polynomials","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal detection","MIMO system","quantum ant colony algorithm","multiple-input multiple-output technology","system capacity","transmission power","system bandwidth","QACA","computational complexity","polynomial","maximum likelihood detection","VBLAST"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","Signal Detection","Quantum Ant Colony Algorithm","Maximum Likelihood Detection"]}],"abstract":"The multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology uses several antennas on both of the launch and the receiver terminal.

Especially, Gaussian distribution is selected as a special case for discussion, which can be applied to an outdoor microcell propagation environment. The proposed model reveals the key features of high-speed railway (HSR) channels to better get closed to the fact. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system is perfectly used to deal with fast time-varying channel estimation based on the sparsity of HSR channels.

The inherently high path loss in mmWave can be compensated by adopting large antenna array. However, huge cost of radio frequency (RF) chains at high frequencies, as well as large number of antennas, makes full-digital precoding in mmWave-MIMO system infeasible. Hence, hybrid analog/digital precoding techniques are proposed to reduce the hardware cost of RF components while achieving similar performance as full-digital precoder. Usually it requires iterative process and matrix inversion to split full-digital precoder into hybrid structure. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity hybrid precoding algorithm with predefined rotated multilevel-DFT codebook. It can leverage orthogonal mapping process to avoid iterative process and matrix inversion. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve 97.6% spectrum efficiency compared with state-of-the-art low-complexity hybrid precoding algorithm while reducing 99.7% complexity in terms of complex multiplications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7744430/7753583/07753597.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2016.7753597","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2016.7753597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753583","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7753597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilevel-DFT based low-complexity hybrid precoding for millimeter wave MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Precoding","Discrete Fourier transforms","Algorithm design and analysis","Array signal processing","Matching pursuit algorithms","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","analogue-digital conversion","antenna arrays","discrete Fourier transforms","iterative methods","matrix inversion","millimetre waves","MIMO communication","next generation networks","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilevel DFT based low-complexity hybrid precoding","millimeter wave multiple-input multiple-output","millimeter wave MIMO systems","mmWave MIMO system","next-generation 5G communication systems","antenna array","radio frequency chains","full-digital precoding","hybrid analog-digital precoding techniques","RF components","iterative process","matrix inversion","orthogonal mapping process","hybrid precoding algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["millimeter wave MIMO","hybrid precoding","beamforming","low-complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7753597/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Multilevel-DFT based low-complexity hybrid precoding for millimeter wave MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7753597/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16499020","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilevel-DFT based low-complexity hybrid precoding for millimeter wave MIMO systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"com02-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084721S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7744430","isNumber":"7753583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7744430","xplore-issue":"7753583","articleId":"7753597","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7753598,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng-Ju Ku","affiliation":["The Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, Tatung University, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China"],"firstName":"Sheng-Ju","lastName":"Ku","id":"37285249600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2708-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2709-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7753598","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Computational complexity","Partial transmit sequences","Cost function","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved low-complexity PTS scheme","partial transmit sequences scheme","PAPR reduction","OFDM systems","peak-to-average power ratio reduction","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","cost functions","time-domain samples","two-stage algorithm","computational complexity reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT)","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","partial transmit sequences (PTS)","peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an improved low-complexity partial transmit sequences (PTS) scheme is proposed to reduce the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.

Compared to related works, the proposed PTS scheme can achieve similar PAPR reduction performance, but with much lower computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2016.7753598","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7744430/7753583/07753598.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2016.7753598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753583","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved low-complexity PTS scheme for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7753598","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An improved low-complexity PTS scheme for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7753598/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16499044","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7753598/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved low-complexity PTS scheme for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"com02-06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072708S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7744430","isNumber":"7753583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7744430","xplore-issue":"7753583","articleId":"7753598","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7753605,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jun Li","id":"38008056000"},{"name":"Miaowen Wen","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Miaowen Wen","id":"37720016500"},{"name":"Xueqin Jiang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Donghua University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Xueqin Jiang","id":"37086163223"},{"name":"Yier Yan","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Yier Yan","id":"37400765300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2708-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2709-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7753605","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"abstract":"The control signal (CS) is an integral essential part for the transmission of uplink and downlink channels in long-term evolution (LTE) systems. Hence, an inaccurate detection method for the CS leads to a severe performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel CS detection method for LTE-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The proposed method dispenses with the channel estimation compared with the conventional maximum-likelihood (ML) detection, which avoid intersecting the pilots in the transmitted signals. Duo to this fact, our proposed detection method can increase the system transmission rate without any additional expense. Monte-Carlo simulations are performed. The simulation results show that the proposed detection outperforms the ML detection when transmitting a large length of control signals.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference

The HetNet is affected by base station (BS) densities, transmission powers, beam gains, beamwidths, path loss exponents and cell association bias factors. We derive the association probability, average number of users in a layer and the PDF of the distance to the serving BS for the proposed beamforming HetNet. Then the SINR (Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio) function is formulated. Moreover, we derive the outage probability of the network and use stochastic geometry to simulate the system performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7753609/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16499112","htmlLink":"/document/7753609/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Outage analysis for 5G beamforming heterogeneous networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage analysis for 5G beamforming heterogeneous networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"com03-11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070378S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7744430","isNumber":"7753583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7744430","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7753583","articleId":"7753609","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7753622,"authors":[{"name":"Ankit Rajpal","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Ankit","lastName":"Rajpal","id":"37085652756"},{"name":"Anurag Mishra","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Anurag","lastName":"Mishra","id":"37595168100"},{"name":"Rajni Bala","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Rajni","lastName":"Bala","id":"37651734500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2708-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2709-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7753622","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7753622","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Mathematical model","Training data","Training","Gray-scale","Visualization","Discrete wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image watermarking","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple scaling factor based semiblind grayscale image watermarking","OS-ELM neural network","online sequential extreme learning machine","four-level DWT","LL4 subband coefficients","watermark embedding","multiple scaling factor scheme","MSF scheme","signed image visual quality","PSNR","BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Semi-Blind Watermarking","Neural Networks","Extreme Learning Machine","OS-ELM","PSNR","BER"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2016.7753622","pdfPath":"/iel7/7744430/7753583/07753622.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753583","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2016.7753622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple scaling factors based Semi-Blind watermarking of grayscale images using OS-ELM neural network","abstract":"In this paper, a multiple scaling factor based Semi-Blind watermarking scheme for grayscale image watermarking using Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) is proposed. Four-level DWT is applied on three standard test images of size 512 \u00d7 512. LL4 sub-band coefficients are chosen for watermark embedding. OS-ELM is initially tuned with a fixed number of training data used in its initial phase and size of data block learned in each iteration. The training set is developed by combining the quantized and desired LL4 sub-band coefficients. This training set is fed to OS-ELM for training. The output of OS-ELM is a sequence of predicted coefficients which is sorted and divided into three equal parts. Multiple Scaling Factor (MSF) scheme is used for embedding a binary watermark in a Semi-Blind manner. Results show good visual quality of signed images and good similarity between the extracted and original watermarks from signed and attacked images. The PSNR and BER are found to be well optimized both in case of signed and attacked images. The time for embedding and extraction is in milliseconds, which makes the proposed technique effective for developing real time watermarking applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7753622/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16499122","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7753622/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multiple scaling factors based Semi-Blind watermarking of grayscale images using OS-ELM neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple scaling factors based Semi-Blind watermarking of grayscale images using OS-ELM neural network","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"cpt02-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073265S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7744430","isNumber":"7753583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7744430","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7753583","articleId":"7753622","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7753647,"authors":[{"name":"Cui Lin","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information, Xi'an Polytechnic University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Cui Lin","id":"37086209333"},{"name":"Jiao Yameng","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information, Xi'an Polytechnic University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Jiao Yameng","id":"37086206723"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2708-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2709-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7753647","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Array signal processing","Interference","Robustness","Signal processing algorithms","Support vector machines","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","regression analysis","risk analysis","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beamforming algorithm","pointing error","direction-of-arrival mismatch","linear constrained minimum variance beamformer","support vector regression algorithm","structural risk minimization","SVR-based beamforming method","signal array manifold vector errors","DOA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["beamforming","linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV)","support vector regression (SVR)","robustness"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7753647","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2016.7753647","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","abstract":"In this paper a robust beamforming method is proposed, which can effectively overcome the influence of DOA(direction of arrival) mismatch.

Under the maximizing the output signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR) criterion, the waveform optimization problem for improving the detection performance of STAP is derived, which is subjected to the constant modulus constraint. To tackle the resultant nonlinear and complicated optimization issue, a novel diagonal loading (DL) based method is proposed to reformulate it as a semidefinite programming (SDP) one, and then this problem can be solved very efficiently. In what follows, the optimized waveform covariance matrix (WCM) can be obtained to maximize the output SINR of MIMO-OFDM such that the detection performance of STAP can be improved. The simulation results show that the proposed method can improve the output SINR detection performance considerably, as compared to that of uncorrelated waveforms.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2016.7753664","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7744430/7753583/07753664.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2016.7753664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753583","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO-OFDM radar waveform design for improving the detection performance of STAP","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7753664","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7753664/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO-OFDM radar waveform design for improving the detection performance of STAP","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16499100","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7753664/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO-OFDM radar waveform design for improving the detection performance of STAP","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"spg02-09.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052637S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7744430","isNumber":"7753583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7744430","xplore-issue":"7753583","articleId":"7753664","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7753672,"authors":[{"name":"Yuping Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, People's Republic of China"],"firstName":"Yuping","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085527101"},{"name":"Wenjing Li","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, People's Republic of China"],"lastName":"Wenjing Li","id":"37087989717"},{"name":"Qiang Chen","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, People's Republic of China"],"lastName":"Qiang Chen","id":"37087260379"},{"name":"Cheng Jin","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, People's Republic of China"],"lastName":"Cheng Jin","id":"37596563000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2708-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2709-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7753672","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":196},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrices","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Robustness","Array signal processing","Estimation","Taylor series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","array signal processing","covariance matrices","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust adaptive beamformer","desired signal covariance matrix estimation","desired signal component removal","desired signal direction","first-order Taylor series approximation","signal steering vector","signal steering power","iterative robust minimum variance beamforming","interference-plus-noise covariance matrix","gain perturbation","phase perturbation"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust adaptive beamformer based on desired signal covariance matrix estimation","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2016.7753672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753583","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7744430/7753583/07753672.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2016.7753672","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7753672","abstract":"In order to remove desired signal component from the sample covariance matrix, a novel robust adaptive beamformer is proposed based on desired signal covariance matrix estimation.

However, in the case of low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), the biases of the estimates of the direction of the signals and clutter are relatively large. And the biases could not be calibrated by the conventional Particle Filter (PF) algorithm. Therefore, in this paper, a direction tracking algorithm based on the repulsive force model with low SNR in MIMO HF sky-wave radar is proposed to improve the accuracy of the direction tracking. Firstly, the MUSIC algorithm based on the Toeplitz approximation is used to obtain the directions of the signals, which are most often taken as the coherent sources for better resolution performance. Secondly, we develop the repulsive force model with Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE), and add it to the Markov Chain Monte Carlo Particle Filter (MCMC-PF) algorithm. We compare the azimuth estimates obtained by the MUSIC algorithm based on the Toeplitz approximation method using the PF algorithm with the repulsive force model and the PF algorithm without the repulsive force model. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm. The algorithm can be applied to DOD and DOA estimates of the azimuth and the elevation with the proper antenna array.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2016.7753689","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7744430/7753583/07753689.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2016.7753689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753583","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A direction tracking algorithm based on the repulsive force model with low SNR in MIMO HF sky-wave radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7753689","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A direction tracking algorithm based on the repulsive force model with low SNR in MIMO HF sky-wave radar","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7753689/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16499048","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7753689/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A direction tracking algorithm based on the repulsive force model with low SNR in MIMO HF sky-wave radar","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"SPG04-08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063543S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7744430","isNumber":"7753583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7744430","xplore-issue":"7753583","articleId":"7753689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7753692,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Qingli","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shanxi, P.

We believe that improving the spectral-efficiency is a decent approach to increase the capacity of UWA systems. In this paper, we introduce a highly spectrum-efficient MIMO-OFDM system under UWA channel that uses blind channel estimation and elimination of phase ambiguity induced in equalization. We employ classic subspace algorithm (SPA) as the blind channel estimation method without the training sequences and pilot tones. To maximize the performance of SPA, a resampling-based solution to mitigate the channel Doppler shift is applied at the receiver. Considering the phase ambiguity introduced inherently in SPA, we use an interleaved symbol mapping schemes to eliminate the ambiguity, which achieves no rotational symmetry in the combined signal constellation. Numerical simulations verified that the phase error could be corrected without any data aiding and the spectrum efficiency of MIMO-OFDM UWA communications is greatly improved compared with pilot-based method.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2016.7753711","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7744430/7753583/07753711.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2016.7753711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753583","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind channel estimation and phase ambiguity elimination in MIMO-OFDM UWA communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7753711","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Blind channel estimation and phase ambiguity elimination in MIMO-OFDM UWA communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7753711/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16499023","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7753711/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind channel estimation and phase ambiguity elimination in MIMO-OFDM UWA communications","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"spx1-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052008S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7744430","isNumber":"7753583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7744430","xplore-issue":"7753583","articleId":"7753711","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7753719,"authors":[{"name":"Lanjun Liu","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Lanjun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085785204"},{"name":"Yonglei Zhang","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Yonglei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088818439"},{"name":"Pengcheng Zhang","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Pengcheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085817318"},{"name":"Lin Zhou","affiliation":["Ocean University of China, Qingdao, Shandong, CN"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086209312"},{"name":"Jianfen Li","affiliation":["State Oceanic Administration, The First Institute of Oceanography, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Jianfen","lastName":"Li","id":"37088818265"},{"name":"Jiucai Jin","affiliation":["State Oceanic Administration, The First Institute of Oceanography, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Jiucai","lastName":"Jin","id":"37085782516"},{"name":"Jie Zhang","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37540286300"},{"name":"Zhichao Lv","affiliation":["College of Underwater Acoustic Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Zhichao","lastName":"Lv","id":"37085820430"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2708-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2709-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7753719","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":439},"abstract":"Aiming at the requirement of Doppler and channel estimation which applied to underwater mobile communication with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology, a PN sequence based method for Doppler and channel estimation is proposed, an underwater acoustic OFDM communication system structure is given and a block data frame based on PN sequence is designed.

While in the aspect of channel estimation, decision feedback channel estimation method based on PN sequence is used.

Actually, image blocks belong to salient region need more measurements while less measurements can meet the need of image blocks that are not salient when considering about observation in BCS. In this paper, an adaptive image compression based on compressed sensing is proposed. The observation matrix is designed according to the image saliency. The more important image block is, the more measurements this block will get. The saliency will be measured according to spatial domain (Image Activity Measure) and frequency domain (bispectrum).

Due to the complex sea clutter and m-D of marine target, traditional detection methods using time-frequency analysis have great limitations on accuracy and computational cost. In this paper, the micromotion signal model of sea surface target is firstly established according to the length of observation time. Then a novel detection and m-D extraction method is established via sparse time-frequency analysis, i.e., short-time fractional Fourier transform in sparse domain (SSTFRFT). The definition and calculation are described in detail. Finally, experimental results using real radar data, i.e., S-band searching radar (SSR) data, indicate that the proposed method can achieve excellent detection performance and lower computational cost with higher accuracy compared with the traditional methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing

The overall system is divided into the SVC-DCs and the external system for studies. Theoretical analysis indicates that the increase of the gain of a SVC-DC may cause an unstable control mode oscillation, and installation of another SVC-DC may cause destabilizing interactions between them. To solve this problem, a feedback controller is proposed and added on the SVC-DC. Case study is undertaken based on a 10-machine 39-bus system with two SVC devices. Simulation results verify that destabilizing interactions will appear when feedback gains of the external system between SVC-DCs are positive. Otherwise, the destabilizing interactions will disappear. In addition, nonlinear time domain simulation results also validate the proposed feedback controller added on the SVC-DC can suppress the control mode oscillation caused by interactions effectively to maintain the system stable.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753843","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/POWERCON.2016.7753861","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Power System Technology (POWERCON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Power System Technology (POWERCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7735973/7753843/07753861.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/POWERCON.2016.7753861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interaction analysis and oscillation mitigation among multiple SVC-based damping controllers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2016-Oct. 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"Interaction analysis and oscillation mitigation among multiple SVC-based damping controllers","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-1 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7753861/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16488043","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7753861/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interaction analysis and oscillation mitigation among multiple SVC-based damping controllers","confLoc":"Wollongong, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"03POWERCON2016paper118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053522S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2016-Oct. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7735973","isNumber":"7753843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7735973","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7753843","articleId":"7753861","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7753874,"authors":[{"name":"Mayuko Sato","affiliation":["School of Interdisciplinary Mathematical Sciences, Meiji University Nakano-ku, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Mayuko","lastName":"Sato","id":"37086090855"},{"name":"Yoshilazu Fukuyama","affiliation":["School of Interdisciplinary Mathematical Sciences, Meiji University Nakano-ku, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshilazu","lastName":"Fukuyama","id":"37086210018"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8848-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8849-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7753874","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Total optimization of smart community by particle swarm optimization considering reduction of search space","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Power System Technology (POWERCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7735973/7753843/07753874.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Power System Technology (POWERCON)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/POWERCON.2016.7753874","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753843","doi":"10.1109/POWERCON.2016.7753874","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","public administration","search problems","smart cities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["total smart community optimization","particle swarm optimization","search space","SC","PSO","energy flow models","energy supply models","electric power utility","natural gas utility","drinking water","waste water treatment models","energy consumption models","facility characteristics","energy load characteristics","weekday facility operation","Toyama city","Japan"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","smart community","total optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7753874","abstract":"This paper presents a total optimization method of a smart community (SC) by particle swarm optimizati s on (PSO) considering reduction of search space.

In this paper a hybrid Priority List and Particle Swarm Optimization (PL-PSO) approach to solve Unit Commitment (UC) and Economic Load Dispatch (ELD) of thermal units integrated with renewable sources like wind and solar power plant is presented. The on/off decision of thermal units is handled by PL technique, while Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) solves ELD. Both programs are run simultaneously, fine tuning their solutions in search of a better solution. Wind and solar power output is modeled using MATLAB Simulink tool and coding respectively. Wind and Solar uncertainties are handled using scheduling of operating reserve Ancillary service. The problem formulation considers minimum up and down time, start up cost and spinning reserve constraints. The objective is to minimize the fuel cost associated with thermal units while satisfying constraints. Case studies are performed on 10 and 54 thermal unit systems including solar and wind generation and the results are encouraging.","doi":"10.1109/POWERCON.2016.7753989","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Power System Technology (POWERCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7735973/7753843/07753989.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Power System Technology (POWERCON)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/POWERCON.2016.7753989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753843","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Priority list and particle swarm optimization based unit commitment of thermal units including renewable uncertainties","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power generation","Particle swarm optimization","Thermal loading","Uncertainty","Mathematical model","Production","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air pollution control","particle swarm optimisation","power generation dispatch","power generation economics","power generation scheduling","renewable energy sources","thermal power stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unit commitment","thermal units","renewable uncertainties","environmental pollution minimization","hybrid priority list and particle swarm optimization","solar power plant","economic load dispatch","fuel cost minimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Unit Commitment(UC)","Economic Load Dispatch(ELD)","particle swarm optimization(PSO)","Priority List method (PL)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7753989/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2016-Oct. 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"Priority list and particle swarm optimization based unit commitment of thermal units including renewable uncertainties","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7753989/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-1 Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16487988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Priority list and particle swarm optimization based unit commitment of thermal units including renewable uncertainties","confLoc":"Wollongong, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"03POWERCON2016paper303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078213S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2016-Oct. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7735973","isNumber":"7753843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7735973","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7753843","articleId":"7753989","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7754007,"authors":[{"name":"Ugonna R.

The present paper demonstrates a practical solution obtaining satisfactory performance in damping power system oscillations utilizing the flexible Voltage Source Converter-High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC-VSC) transmission technology in an optimal combination with a Power Oscillation Damping (POD) controller such as Nonlinear Autoregressive Moving Average (NARMA-L2), utilizing active power modulation technique. The primary focus of the control scheme is to improve the damping of lightly damped or even unstable modes of the interconnected AC/DC power system through modal identification and estimation techniques. The performance of aforesaid control technique is compared with that of conventionally tuned PI control scheme. The designed control scheme guarantees stability margins through eigenvalue analysis and non-linear time domain simulations during symmetrical and asymmetrical faults.

In this paper, a simulated design of power amplifier (PA) is introduced to improve the transmitter side of the WPT system (from input to transmitter coil). Optimum setting of Class E power amplifier that can be applied to portable power chargers available in the market is studied. GaN transistor with shunt capacitor is used due to its high efficiency and low resistance between drain and source.

The FFT based frequency estimation is adaptive, requires no prior information and is also capable to diagnose all the PQ disturbances. The improved spectral segmentation followed by an adaptive filter design accurately extracts the fundamental frequency component, thereby enabling the extraction of informative features. Thus, the proposed approach combines the GEWT and a simple rule based decision tree (DT) for accurate recognition of most significant PQ disturbances. The DT classifier with five features extracted from the GEWT is refined and finally tested on 1200 simulated as well as three real disturbance signals.

Hence, optimizing any Wi-Fi campus area network by characterizing the propagation channels becomes necessary. Even though accurate evaluation of onsite performance is possible with direct measurements, it requires considerable amount of time and efforts. Therefore, modeling the electromagnetic wave propagation using a computer tool and characterizing the wireless channel from the building plans and material properties would be a good solution. This paper considers an approach for developing such a simulation tool for propagation prediction of electromagnetic waves in a Wi-Fi network of 2.4 GHz and to predict the path loss characteristics. Assuming that the scattering objects are much larger than their wavelength, the electromagnetic waves are modeled as rays. In addition, as most of the college campuses are covered with trees in India, the signal variation due to tree canopy has also been studied.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754099","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754099","startPage":"2273","endPage":"2277","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736795/7754082/07754099.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of Wi-Fi signal propagation under tree canopy in a college campus","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 April 2016","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of Wi-Fi signal propagation under tree canopy in a college campus","conferenceDate":"6-8 April 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7754099/","accessionNumber":"16498286","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7754099/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of Wi-Fi signal propagation under tree canopy in a college campus","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"ICCSP1039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064357S","chronDate":"6-8 April 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736795","isNumber":"7754082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736795","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7754082","articleId":"7754099","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7754105,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The principal task of a CR system is to sense the holes (spaces) effectively and efficiently in the designated frequency spectrum. Here in this work spectrum sensing is carried out by Cyclostationary detector. A random signal is generated and it is modulated either by Binary shift phase keying (BPSK) or Quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK). The Modulated random signal is added with Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and passed through Cyclostationary spectrum detector to check whether it crosses the threshold level to for the presence of primary user. The threshold of a signal is calculated by cyclic cross-periodogram matrix of the corresponding signal to determine the presence of signal or noise. The impediment in evaluating the targeted threshold is prevailed by training an artificial neural network by extracted cyclostationary feature vectors which are obtained by FFT accumulation method.

Information hiding techniques have recently become important in a number of application areas.

One approach is to introduce an invisible image known as digital watermark, into an image sequence. This paper presents secured algorithms for embedding digital watermarks into images. The proposed method performs imperceptible watermarking of images in frequency domain. The watermark is embedded in the DWT and DCT domain of an image in a multi-resolution way. In the decoding phase, once the watermark is extracted from the watermarked image, certain performance measures such as peak signal to mean noise ratio (PSNR) and correlation are calculated. Different types of attacks have been applied to the watermarked image to test the robustness of the applied technique and for each case, PSNR and correlation are calculated. Even though DWT method gives better results when compared to DCT, performances of both methods are good.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754123","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736795/7754082/07754123.pdf","startPage":"0208","endPage":"0211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital image watermarking in frequency domain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Digital image watermarking in frequency domain","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16488716","publicationDate":"April 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7754123/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7754123/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 April 2016","conferenceDate":"6-8 April 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital image watermarking in frequency domain","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"ICCSP128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030911S","chronDate":"6-8 April 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736795","isNumber":"7754082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736795","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7754082","articleId":"7754123","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7754125,"authors":[{"name":"Monirul Islam","affiliation":["University Malaysia, Perlis, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Monirul","lastName":"Islam","id":"37085392102"},{"name":"N.

Further, the unique signature sequence is considered to support more user population. In particular, the performance of MMSE-MUTP assisted CDMA system is investigated for realistic channel specifications based on Stanford University Interim (SUI) channel model.

Hence, image restoration is necessary in the image processing domain to extract all the information present in the images. The low contrast satellite image restoration based on adaptive histogram equalization combined with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is proposed in this paper. The proposed technique is experimented on three different satellite images. The effectiveness of the method introduced in this paper is shown by comparing it against the existing techniques based on gamma correction and histogram equalization combined with DCT and DWT. The comparison is done based on the standard parameters called Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Standard Deviation.

Opportunistic routing (OR) aims at improving the former and coping with the latter. Due to the unreliable characteristics of such channels, traditional routing achieves poor throughput. Since traditional routing arbitrarily selects high lossy links among diverse paths of same minimum length. This paper focuses on designing a multipath, multichannel opportunistic ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing protocol that uses shortest distance as well as expected transmissions count (ETX) as a parameter to choose the next forwarding node and the most reliable link respectively. The conventional AODV uses hop count for the selection of route in the network. In this paper it is proposed to harvest the advantage of OR with AODV for cognitive radio wireless sensor networks (CRWSN) to improve its efficiency. The ETX is computed based on the quantized value of RSSI of the links. Using ETX the reliable link is computed and stored in routing table. The packets are forwarded to the destination using the next hop and channel details available in the routing table. The routing parameters such as capacity, spectrum occupancy, throughput, and packet delivery ratio (PDR) are evaluated. Simulation result shows that opportunistic AODV protocol yields increased PDR (7%) than traditional AODV in the presence of two interferers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7754168/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 April 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 April 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7754168/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"16498027","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic AODV routing protocol for cognitive radio wireless sensor networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic AODV routing protocol for cognitive radio wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"ICCSP223.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04689S","chronDate":"6-8 April 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736795","isNumber":"7754082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736795","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7754082","articleId":"7754168","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-25"},{"_id":7754174,"authors":[{"name":"Kalpesh Hiray","affiliation":["Communication Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India"],"firstName":"Kalpesh","lastName":"Hiray","id":"37086204842"},{"name":"K.

In practice, opportunistic relaying often experiences Rician fading channel, however, there is a very limited contribution on opportunistic AF OFDMA system over this fading channel. In this paper, we adopt Rician fading environment for closed-form outage probability analysis of opportunistic AF OFDMA relaying. The opportunistic AF OFDMA relaying is a relay selection process where the best relay nodes are selected based on maximum SNR per subcarrier per relay node. The opportunistic AF OFDMA relaying obtains diversity over both subcarriers and relay nodes where opportunistic AF over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) relaying gets diversity only over relay nodes. Thus opportunistic AF OFDMA provides better outage performance over opportunistic AF OFDM and opportunistic AF single carrier relaying. The analytical outage probability is validated through Monte-Carlo simulations at high SNR regime and compared with existing relaying techniques.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754175","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736795/7754082/07754175.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754082","startPage":"0442","endPage":"0447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A closed-form outage probability of opportunistic AF OFDMA relaying over Rician fading channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7754175","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A closed-form outage probability of opportunistic AF OFDMA relaying over Rician fading channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 April 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7754175/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 April 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"16497999","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7754175/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A closed-form outage probability of opportunistic AF OFDMA relaying over Rician fading channel","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"ICCSP235.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099921S","chronDate":"6-8 April 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736795","isNumber":"7754082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736795","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7754082","articleId":"7754175","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7754181,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In this paper, we present a robust estimation of adaptive deblurring using simulated annealing algorithm. The proposed algorithm provides efficient fitness for the estimation process, even in the presence of noise as well as large blurs. The experimental result shows that, the problems of low deblurring efficiency and low PSNR ratios have been efficiently overcome by using this algorithm of adaptive deblurring using simulated annealing algorithm.

The signals are measured by placing electrodes on the scalp. The major sources of baseline wander in EEG signals are because of the poor contact of the electrodes and change in impedance of the electrode which can be attributed to perspiration. For effective analysis of such signals, denoising methods have to be developed. This paper proposes a low complexity method to remove baseline wander and detrend EEG signals. Dedicated handheld devices require a computationally simpler algorithm to pre-process EEG signals. This paper proposes a cascaded moving average filter as a simple and computationally efficient methodology for detrending of EEG signals. To indicate the simplicity, this work has concentrated on real-time implementation by implementing it on Xilinx XC7Z020-CLG484-1. Parameters have been derived indicating the efficiency of the proposed methodology for detrending of EEG signals. The filter discussed in this work has its uses in preprocessing of EEG signals for applications such as Brain-Computer Interface and epileptic seizure detection.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754244","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736795/7754082/07754244.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754082","startPage":"0745","endPage":"0750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real time cascaded moving average filter for detrending of electroencephalogram signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7754244","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real time cascaded moving average filter for detrending of electroencephalogram signals","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 April 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7754244/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 April 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"16488816","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7754244/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real time cascaded moving average filter for detrending of electroencephalogram signals","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"ICCSP384.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056475S","chronDate":"6-8 April 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736795","isNumber":"7754082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736795","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7754082","articleId":"7754244","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7754249,"authors":[{"name":"Reena Choudhary","affiliation":["Yeshwantrao Chavan College of Engineering, Nagpur, India"],"firstName":"Reena","lastName":"Choudhary","id":"37086202311"},{"name":"Somulu Gugulothu","affiliation":["Yeshwantrao Chavan College of Engineering, Nagpur, India"],"firstName":"Somulu","lastName":"Gugulothu","id":"37085355501"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0396-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-0395-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8549-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7754249","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":432},"abstract":"Neural recording is a way to learn, figure out and reserve the neural activities.

In this paper, it's the first time we are presenting ASR designs based on two important machine learning paradigms Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for an rare and geographically important Indian dialect `Chhattisgarhi'. The conventional feed-forward ANN and SVM have been applied on the dataset of maximum 50 isolated words of 15 speakers. The performance of these machine learning paradigms is compared with state of art Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The tendency of ASR to be speaker dependent and independent has been extensively investigated with speaker variation experiments. Furthermore the reliability and stability of ASR has been confirmed with numerical validation. The exhaustive review of ASR techniques from the literature along with the ASR systems designed on Indian languages is presented.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754251","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736795/7754082/07754251.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754082","startPage":"0780","endPage":"0786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Machine learning paradigms for speech recognition of an Indian dialect","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7754251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Machine learning paradigms for speech recognition of an Indian dialect","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 April 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7754251/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 April 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"16488807","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7754251/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Machine learning paradigms for speech recognition of an Indian dialect","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"ICCSP393.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065909S","chronDate":"6-8 April 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736795","isNumber":"7754082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736795","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7754082","articleId":"7754251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7754263,"authors":[{"name":"Rashmi S.

Many techniques are proposed to lower down the test power. In scan based design, rippling transition created by test patterns shifting along the scan chain not only rises power loss but also offers spurious switching activities in the combinational circuits or logic. This paper propose a novel scan cell architecture for low power scan based technique with power-efficiency that provides combined solution for reducing total average power in both combinational part and scan cell during capture mode and shift mode. The proposed scan cell reduces the number of transitions during shift and capture mode. The proposed method is implemented on the different combinational Tanner circuits and the experimental results were observed. Simulation results have shown that the proposed gating scan cell save 20~25% total average power in shift and capture mode as compared to conventional scan cell.","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736795/7754082/07754270.pdf","startPage":"0866","endPage":"0870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI implementation of low power scan based testing","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754270","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7754270","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7754270/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 April 2016","displayDocTitle":"VLSI implementation of low power scan based testing","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"16498124","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 April 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7754270/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI implementation of low power scan based testing","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"ICCSP425.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051178S","chronDate":"6-8 April 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736795","isNumber":"7754082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736795","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7754082","articleId":"7754270","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7754281,"authors":[{"name":"M Suganya","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham University, India"],"firstName":"M","lastName":"Suganya","id":"37086208882"},{"name":"R Gandhiraj","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham University, India"],"firstName":"R","lastName":"Gandhiraj","id":"37085356718"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0396-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-0395-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8549-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7754281","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":376},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","OFDM","Satellites","Satellite broadcasting","Encoding","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","satellite antennas","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM technology","SATCOM","MIMO technology","multicarrier systems","satellite communication","multiple antenna","terrestrial communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple Input and Multiple Output (MIMO)","Satellite Communication","Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)","Diversity","Multiplexing gain","Data rate"]}],"abstract":"This paper provides a comprehensive survey focused on applicability of MIMO and Multicarrier systems to satellite communication.

In complex DSP processors each and every operation has to access the off chip even though it has certain amount of on chip memory for random access purpose (RAM), but in all the time RAM will not be fully utilized for random access. The usage of that memory will depends upon the operation takes place in processor. So by adding an extra word line to change the random access memory to read only memory is proposed. Here 8T transmission gate based design is used to create an array 4\u00d74 configurable random access memory and it has an extra word line to configure the certain part of RAM to ROM to act as cache memory. By using this on chip catch memory the propagation delay occurs while accessing off chip memory will be reduced, this will reduce the bottle neck to increase the speed of the processor. Due to extra word line separate address decoder logic was designed, decoder will decide which is to be consider as RAM and which is to be consider as ROM. Transmission gate based SRAM is used to avoid the weak logic occurred while using pass transistor logic.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754282","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736795/7754082/07754282.pdf","startPage":"0921","endPage":"0925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754282","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7754282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of 8T ROM embedded SRAM using double wordline for low power high speed application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7754282/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 April 2016","displayDocTitle":"Design of 8T ROM embedded SRAM using double wordline for low power high speed application","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16498071","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"April 2016","conferenceDate":"6-8 April 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7754282/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of 8T ROM embedded SRAM using double wordline for low power high speed application","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"ICCSP446.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048399S","chronDate":"6-8 April 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736795","isNumber":"7754082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736795","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7754082","articleId":"7754282","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7754290,"authors":[{"name":"Ganesh Prasad","affiliation":["Electronics & Communication Engineering Department, NIT Silchar, Assam, India"],"firstName":"Ganesh","lastName":"Prasad","id":"37086206326"},{"name":"Vishal Kumar","affiliation":["Electronics & Communication Engineering Department, NIT Silchar, Assam, India"],"firstName":"Vishal","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37086202339"},{"name":"Ashraf Hossain","affiliation":["Electronics & Communication Engineering Department, NIT Silchar, Assam, India"],"firstName":"Ashraf","lastName":"Hossain","id":"37690915600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0396-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-0395-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8549-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7754290","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":213},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","Wireless sensor networks","Routing protocols","Network coding","Energy efficiency","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy consumption","stochastic processes","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensor nodes deployment","event driven wireless sensor network","lifetime enhancement","optimal deployment","sensor nodes","inter-node distance","multi hop mode","Poisson distribution","energy consumption","single hop mode"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Event driven wireless sensor network","Proper deployment","Lifetime of event driven network","Inter-node distance","Multi-hop mode","Residual energy","Single-hop mode"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deployment of sensor nodes for enhancement of lifetime in event driven wireless sensor network","abstract":"This paper focuses on enhancement of lifetime in an event driven wireless sensor network (WSN). The network lifetime is enhanced by optimal deployment of sensor nodes in a given region as premature shortening of life takes place leading to uneven consumption of energy. In the proposed scheme, the senor nodes are linearly deployed over the sub-regions and the inter-node distance between the sensor nodes depends on the statistics of events sensed by the sensor nodes in multi hop mode of communication. The performance is measured with respect to the residual energy at each sensor node and total number of days spent by sensor nodes. The lifetime of the sensor network is defined as the survival of some fraction of nodes. For an approximate Poisson distribution for occurrence of events in different sub-regions, the variation of energy consumption in sensor nodes is negligibly small. Further if some nodes are having finite residual energy even after failure of some nodes, then those nodes can continue their communication in single hop mode and hence the lifetime of the network is further extended.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7754290","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736795/7754082/07754290.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754290","startPage":"0961","endPage":"0966","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754290","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7754290/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 April 2016","displayDocTitle":"Deployment of sensor nodes for enhancement of lifetime in event driven wireless sensor network","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"6-8 April 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7754290/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"16498084","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deployment of sensor nodes for enhancement of lifetime in event driven wireless sensor network","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"ICCSP456.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053215S","chronDate":"6-8 April 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736795","isNumber":"7754082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736795","xplore-issue":"7754082","articleId":"7754290","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7754298,"authors":[{"name":"Dhaval Shah","affiliation":["Institute of Technology, Nirma University, Ahmedabad, India"],"firstName":"Dhaval","lastName":"Shah","id":"37085446563"},{"name":"D.

The information signal was transmitted onto the three wavelength channels 1550 nm, 1310 nm, and 850 nm. At the receiver end, Optimal Combining (OC) and Selection Combining (SC) diversity schemes have been deployed to combine multiple carriers. Mathematical analysis is carried out to calculate the outage probability for both the schemes. The simulations are done for the link distances of 2.5 km and 3 km for both the schemes. The achieved results demonstrate that the wavelength diversity improve the performance of the FSO communication link, but at a significant escalation of the system's complication and budget.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736795/7754082/07754298.pdf","startPage":"0999","endPage":"1003","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754082","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7754298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of free space optical link using wavelength diversity over K turbulence channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diversity reception","Receivers","Signal to noise ratio","Optical fiber communication","Optical transmitters","Channel models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric turbulence","diversity reception","free-space optical communication","mathematical analysis","optical links","probability","telecommunication network reliability","wavelength division multiplexing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["free space optical link performance","wavelength diversity techniques","K turbulence channels","atmospheric turbulence outcome reduction","wavelength channels","optimal combining diversity scheme","selection combining diversity scheme","OC diversity scheme","SC diversity scheme","mathematical analysis","outage probability calculation","FSO communication link"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["K turbulence channel","Outage probability","Optimal Combining","Selection Combining","Wavelength diversity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7754298/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 April 2016","displayDocTitle":"Performance of free space optical link using wavelength diversity over K turbulence channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7754298/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"16498284","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"6-8 April 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of free space optical link using wavelength diversity over K turbulence channels","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"ICCSP469.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061726S","chronDate":"6-8 April 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736795","isNumber":"7754082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736795","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7754082","articleId":"7754298","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7754302,"authors":[{"name":"Bhavini J.

The utilization of image processing procedures is of outstanding implication for the analysis of agro based applications. In any case, detection of infections in the fruit products utilizing images is still risky because of the regular changes of skin color in distinctive sorts of fruit products. In this paper three normal infections of apple fruit are considered i.e. Apple scab, apple rot and apple blotch. The image processing based proposed methodology is made out of the accompanying some state of the art color and texture features are extracted from the test image, then color and texture features are fused together and random forest classifier is used for diseases classification and if the fruit is infected by any of the one disease then the infected part is segmented using k-means clustering technique.

However, designing a receiver for quasi-asynchronous MC-CDMA and corresponding code still dates a challenging task. We show that fractional-delay uplink channels, suffer while complete complementary code (CCC) and Walsh-Hadamard (WH) code are used. Thus quasi-asynchronous MC-CDMA system introduces a very high multiple access interference (MAI) at the receiver's output, due to which the system performance may degrade. In this paper we have designed a transceiver for quasi-asynchronous MC-CDMA by using a quasi-complementary sequence sets (QCSS) refer to a set of two-dimensional matrices which have non-zero (low) aperiodic auto - and cross - correlation sums. The proposed transceiver based on QCSS is an interference-free for quasi asynchronous MC-CDMA system and provides better performance than that of CCC and WH based quasi asynchronous MC-CDMA.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754334","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736795/7754082/07754334.pdf","startPage":"1159","endPage":"1163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Receiver design for quasi-asynchronous MC-CDMA by using QCSS code","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7754334/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 April 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Receiver design for quasi-asynchronous MC-CDMA by using QCSS code","conferenceDate":"6-8 April 2016","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"16498069","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7754334/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Receiver design for quasi-asynchronous MC-CDMA by using QCSS code","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"ICCSP536.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094961S","chronDate":"6-8 April 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736795","isNumber":"7754082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736795","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7754082","articleId":"7754334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7754360,"authors":[{"name":"Naginder Singh","affiliation":["School of VLSI Design and Embedded Systems Department, National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra, Haryana, India."],"firstName":"Naginder","lastName":"Singh","id":"37086208775"},{"name":"Trailokya Nath Sasamal","affiliation":["Electronics and Communications Engineering Department, National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra, Haryana, India."],"firstName":"Trailokya Nath","lastName":"Sasamal","id":"37085482960"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0396-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-0395-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8549-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7754360","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":578},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and synthesis of goldschmidt algorithm based floating point divider on FPGA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7754360","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic engineering computing","field programmable gate arrays","floating point arithmetic","hardware description languages","matrix multiplication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["floating point DAF architecture","floating point divide - add fused architecture","HDL","Verilog hardware description language","Urdhva-triyakbhyam-sutra technique","24-bit Vedic multiplication","mantissa computing","floating point subtractor","32-bit floating point multiplier","Goldschmidt computational division algorithm","single precision floating point division","FPGA","Goldschmidt algorithm based floating point divider"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Floating point Divider","FPGA","Goldschmidt Computational algorithm","Urdhva Tiryagbhyam sutra"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a single precision floating point division based on Goldschmidt computational division algorithm.

The most important challenge in wireless sensor networks is to design energy-efficient data gathering network which increases the life time of wireless sensor networks. In various studies, it is observed that processed data requires less power as compared to transmitting data in the wireless medium. Hence, it is more significant to apply compressed sensing algorithm at sensing node. Also, if Compressed Sensing (CS) is used with clustering method it will give significant power saving in wireless sensor networks (WSN). In this paper, we addressed comparison between energy saving obtained by changing random compressive sensing samples and without compressive sensing.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International

communication system, which require effective transmission with resource access for providing diverse Quality of Services (QoS) to accommodate variety of services like multimedia and bursty traffic. MCCDMA-MIMO, Multi Carrier Code Division Multiple Access (MC-CDMA) technique with spatial diversity and spatial multiplexing scheme of multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) has drawn significant interest for the future generation networks due to its ability of multiple access and spectral efficiency. The adaptive modulation is a promising concept to provide a wide variety of communication services such as video, teleconferencing, internet access and real time multimedia services. However, the network of adaptive modulation based MCCDMA-MIMO system has limited throughput performance due to the simultaneous transmissions over sub carriers and non identical fading nature. The power control, sub carrier grouping and adaptive transmission technique is one of the open solutions for QoS enhancement in MCCDMA-MIMO system. In this paper, the water filling game theory is adopted to allocate proper power for every sub-channel and subcarrier group assignment strategy for mitigating interference noise and M-QAM based adaptive modulation is followed for transmission scheme to attain users QoS demands.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754388","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736795/7754082/07754388.pdf","startPage":"1415","endPage":"1419","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power control through water filling game theory in adaptive modulation based MCCDMA-MIMO system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7754388","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 April 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7754388/","displayDocTitle":"Power control through water filling game theory in adaptive modulation based MCCDMA-MIMO system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"16498246","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7754388/","conferenceDate":"6-8 April 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power control through water filling game theory in adaptive modulation based MCCDMA-MIMO system","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"ICCSP655.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06235S","chronDate":"6-8 April 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736795","isNumber":"7754082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736795","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7754082","articleId":"7754388","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7754391,"authors":[{"name":"Pralhad M.

Traditionally licensed spectrum is used only by licensees over relatively long time period with the help of FSA (fixed spectrum allocation) which guarantees the licensed authorized party without interference. According to FCC records, utilization efficiency varies between 15% to 85%, for spectrum allocated in the bands below 3GHz. Due to shortage of frequencies the BW becomes expensive. Cognitive radio (CR) play an important role between scarcity of spectrum and underutilization of the available spectrum. In CR one of the most important technique is spectrum sensing. Spectrum sensing helps to detect the spectrum holes. Energy detection method is one of the simplest spectrum sensing method. But it is particularly challenging for small sample size, low SNR (due to noise uncertainty) and fixing the threshold in conventional energy detection. OFDM-FFT and DWT are the multi carrier modulations used in CR to encounter with high data rates and give high spectral efficiency. In this paper we proposed a volume detection algorithm which using random matrix theory (RMT), provide an efficient spectrum sensing algorithm for OFDM modulated signals implement in CR. It is applied when the PU uses OFDM modulation. With the help of SMT (sample covariance matrix) the theoretical decision threshold accurately produce under the Gaussian noise assumption.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754403","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736795/7754082/07754403.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754082","startPage":"1476","endPage":"1480","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Volume-based spectrum sensing for OFDM based cognitive radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7754403","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Volume-based spectrum sensing for OFDM based cognitive radio","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 April 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7754403/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 April 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"16498075","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7754403/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Volume-based spectrum sensing for OFDM based cognitive radio","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"ICCSP673.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065984S","chronDate":"6-8 April 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736795","isNumber":"7754082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736795","xplore-issue":"7754082","articleId":"7754403","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7754428,"authors":[{"name":"S.

An evolutionary optimization technique called Opposition based Harmony Search Algorithm (OHS) is employed to minimize the total MOSFET area of the designed circuit. The novel Harmony Search (HS) algorithm is selected as the parent and the opposition based approach is employed to it with an intention to exhibit accelerated near-global convergence profile. At the initialization stage, for choosing the randomly generated population/solutions, opposite solutions are also considered and the fitter one is selected as apriori guess. This causes faster convergence profile. Each solution in Harmony Memory (HM) is generated on the basis of memory consideration rule, a pitch adjustment rule and a re-initialization process which gives the optimum result corresponding to the least error fitness in multidimensional search space. Differential Evolution (DE), Harmony Search (HS), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) have an inbuilt disadvantage of early convergence and stagnation problem. But in OHS optimization technique has overcome these shortcomings. The optimally designed differential amplifier circuit occupies the least total MOS area, and shows the best design conditions like gain, power dissipation etc., in comparison with the formerly reported literature.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754428","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754428","startPage":"1589","endPage":"1593","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736795/7754082/07754428.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CMOS analog amplifier circuit sizing using opposition based harmony search algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 April 2016","displayDocTitle":"CMOS analog amplifier circuit sizing using opposition based harmony search algorithm","conferenceDate":"6-8 April 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7754428/","accessionNumber":"16498261","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7754428/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CMOS analog amplifier circuit sizing using opposition based harmony search algorithm","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"ICCSP714.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053704S","chronDate":"6-8 April 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736795","isNumber":"7754082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736795","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7754082","articleId":"7754428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7754431,"authors":[{"name":"P.

However, an OFDM system has the main drawback of having high Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of the transmitted signals. High PAPR causes distortions in the signal when the signals that are modulated are passed through a high power amplifier (HPA). PAPR, if high, increases the hardware complexity and also brings down the power amplifier efficiency. Many techniques are practiced to reduce PAPR. In this article, a novel and effective technique of PAPR reduction is described in which Hierarchical Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (HQAM) scheme is employed. It is found that by increasing the ratio of distances between constellation points, PAPR can be reduced significantly.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754443","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736795/7754082/07754443.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754082","startPage":"1650","endPage":"1653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A PAPR reduction technique in OFDM transmissions using hierarchical QAM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7754443","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A PAPR reduction technique in OFDM transmissions using hierarchical QAM","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 April 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7754443/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 April 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"16498226","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7754443/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A PAPR reduction technique in OFDM transmissions using hierarchical QAM","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"ICCSP744.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052112S","chronDate":"6-8 April 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736795","isNumber":"7754082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736795","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7754082","articleId":"7754443","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7754445,"authors":[{"name":"Rajesh Bera","affiliation":["ECE Department, NIT, Durgapur, India"],"firstName":"Rajesh","lastName":"Bera","id":"38547218400"},{"name":"Durbadal Mandal","affiliation":["ECE Department, NIT, Durgapur, India"],"firstName":"Durbadal","lastName":"Mandal","id":"37408356700"},{"name":"Sakti Prasad Ghoshal","affiliation":["EE Department, NIT, Durgapur, India"],"firstName":"Sakti Prasad","lastName":"Ghoshal","id":"37408158500"},{"name":"Rajib Kar","affiliation":["ECE Department, NIT, Durgapur, India"],"firstName":"Rajib","lastName":"Kar","id":"37411564000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0396-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-0395-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8549-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7754445","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7754445","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Particle swarm optimization","Phased arrays","Geometry","Directive antennas","Antenna radiation patterns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","planar antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet mutation based novel particle swarm optimization technique","single ring planar antenna arrays","NPSOWM technique","circular array","hexagonal array","elliptical array","isotropic antenna elements","EA","CA","HA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Circular Array","Directivity","Elliptical Array","Hexagonal Array","Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)","Wavelet Mutation (WM)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754445","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736795/7754082/07754445.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","startPage":"1659","endPage":"1663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754445","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet Mutation based Novel Particle Swarm Optimization technique for comparison of the performance of single ring planar antenna arrays","abstract":"Wavelet Mutation based Novel Particle Swarm Optimization (NPSOWM) technique is applied for the comparison of the performances of Circular array (CA), Hexagonal Array (HA) and Elliptical Array (EA) of isotropic antenna elements which can produce array pattern with maximum reduced Side-Lobe Level (SLL).

It is highly challenging job to findout an accurate model with minimum prior knowledge in the system that are highly nonlinear and dynamic such as robotics and autonomous system. Fuzzy neural networks are highly used to deal with the real world identification and classification issue. But if the system carries nonlinear behavior then the FNN fails to provide an accurate solution. The rate of learning speed and computational efficiency are the most essential parameter for identification point of view. In this paper a novel method for nonlinear dynamic plant identification is proposed i.e. Pseudo inverse Legendre neural network (with tanh functions in the hidden layer matrix) optimized by using firefly algorithm (LNNT-FF). The proposed model LNN deals with the chaotic variation of the plant by expanding the input pattern. For better performance the firefly optimization technique is used. The firefly algorithm is inspired by the motion and metaheuristic behavior of the fireflies. Light intensity and the attractiveness variation are the two major issues related in FF algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754453","startPage":"1689","endPage":"1693","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754082","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736795/7754082/07754453.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non linear dynamic system identification using Legendre neural network and firefly algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7754453/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Non linear dynamic system identification using Legendre neural network and firefly algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7754453/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16498297","publicationDate":"April 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"6-8 April 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 April 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non linear dynamic system identification using Legendre neural network and firefly algorithm","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"ICCSP760.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048775S","chronDate":"6-8 April 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736795","isNumber":"7754082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736795","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7754082","articleId":"7754453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7754457,"authors":[{"name":"B.

JPEG image compression makes use of quantization table to control the compression ratio and quality of compressed image. Hence, generation of quantization table for the JPEG baseline algorithm is viewed as an optimization problem. For the past few decades, methods used for determining the quantization table have been based on Rate-distortion approach, Human Visual System approach and Meta-Heuristics approach. Even though recent reports suggest that Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a promising algorithm to generate the optimal quantization table, it often gets stuck in local minima.

This paper introduces a recently developed metaheuristic algorithm, known as ALC-PSO, to the pattern synthesis of recently proposed configured planar array, CEA, with desired SLL by amplitude-only optimization. To overcome the problem of premature convergence characteristic of PSO, ALC-PSO is designed without significantly impairing the fast converging property of PSO. To improve the radiation pattern in terms of minimum relative SLL, a set of antenna designed parameters as excitation weights of the elements and eccentricity of the elliptical shaped rings are to be developed. The variation of SLL with eccentricity of synthesized array is also reported. Compare with conventional PSO method, ALC-PSO outperform with the goal of maximum SLL suppression.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754482","startPage":"1817","endPage":"1821","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736795/7754082/07754482.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal design of concentric elliptical array antenna for maximum side-lobe level reduction using particle swarm optimization with aging leader and challengers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Optimization","Antenna radiation patterns","Particle swarm optimization","Aging","Mathematical model","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concentric elliptical array antenna","side-lobe level reduction","particle swarm optimization with aging leader and challengers method","ALC-PSO method","CEA","SLL","amplitude-only optimization","radiation pattern"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization","Leader","Challengers","Concentric Elliptical Array","Side lobe level"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7754482/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 April 2016","displayDocTitle":"Optimal design of concentric elliptical array antenna for maximum side-lobe level reduction using particle swarm optimization with aging leader and challengers","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7754482/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"6-8 April 2016","accessionNumber":"16498021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal design of concentric elliptical array antenna for maximum side-lobe level reduction using particle swarm optimization with aging leader and challengers","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"ICCSP811.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067453S","chronDate":"6-8 April 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736795","isNumber":"7754082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736795","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7754082","articleId":"7754482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7754489,"authors":[{"name":"Amiya Halder","affiliation":["Dept. of CSE, St. Thomas' College of Engg. and Tech., Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Amiya","lastName":"Halder","id":"37410820700"},{"name":"Anuva Pradhan","affiliation":["Dept. of CSE, St. Thomas' College of Engg. and Tech., Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Anuva","lastName":"Pradhan","id":"37086207836"},{"name":"Sourjya Kumar Dutta","affiliation":["Dept. of IT, St. Thomas' College of Engg and Tech., Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Sourjya Kumar","lastName":"Dutta","id":"37089138290"},{"name":"Pritam Bhattacharya","affiliation":["Dept. of CSE, St. Thomas' College of Engg. and Tech., Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Pritam","lastName":"Bhattacharya","id":"37085741519"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0396-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-0395-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8549-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7754489","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":224},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tumors","Image segmentation","Genetic algorithms","Biological cells","Magnetic resonance imaging","Morphological operations","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","brain","fuzzy set theory","genetic algorithms","image segmentation","medical image processing","pattern clustering","tumours"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tumor extraction","MRI images","dynamic genetic algorithm based image segmentation","morphological operation","brain tumor","magnetic resonance imaging","tumor detection","fuzzy C-means clustering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FCM","Genetic Algorithm","Image Segmentation","Morphological operation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7754489","abstract":"Tumor is swelling of the body part, generally without any inflammation that happens due to abnormal growth of cells in that place of the body.

The other popular approach for feature compression is K-means which is complex and time-consuming. The experiments were performed on the proposed noise-robust ASR system for recognizing 65 different words with very low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of -5 dB. The Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCCs) were used as features for speech recognition. Back propagation Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was used to design the ASR system.

OFDM technology possesses various advantages like high spectral efficiency, Immunity against multipath fading and negligible intersymbol interference. However, despite these advantages, OFDM performance has been limited by high Peak Power to Average Power Ratio (PAPR). In this paper, we propose a combined algorithm of Independent Component Analysis (ICA)/Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Clipping method for reducing the PAPR of OFDM System. Firstly, OFDM signal is processed using ICA or PCA to reduce PAPR, and then further reduction is done by using clipping and filtering method. This constitutes a significant reduction in PAPR without the degradation of bit error rate (BER).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel approach for reduction of PAPR in OFDM communication","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754519","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736795/7754082/07754519.pdf","startPage":"1978","endPage":"1981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754082","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7754519","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7754519/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 April 2016","displayDocTitle":"A novel approach for reduction of PAPR in OFDM communication","conferenceDate":"6-8 April 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7754519/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"16498045","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel approach for reduction of PAPR in OFDM communication","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"ICCSP890.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036519S","chronDate":"6-8 April 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736795","isNumber":"7754082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736795","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7754082","articleId":"7754519","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7754544,"authors":[{"name":"Alka Singh","affiliation":["Y C College of Engineering, Nagpur, India"],"firstName":"Alka","lastName":"Singh","id":"37086204045"},{"name":"Shubhangi Rathkanthiwar","affiliation":["Y C College of Engineering, Nagpur, India"],"firstName":"Shubhangi","lastName":"Rathkanthiwar","id":"37891788500"},{"name":"Sandeep Kakde","affiliation":["Y C College of Engineering, Nagpur, India"],"firstName":"Sandeep","lastName":"Kakde","id":"37085361391"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0396-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-0395-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8549-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7754544","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":509},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7754544","abstract":"In this paper, cluster head and vice cluster head selection is discussed and a method of energy efficient routing is presented based on both particle swarm optimisation technique and V-LEACH protocol.

Blind adaptation techniques shows very poor convergence property in contrast to the supervised techniques which uses training sequences e.g. least mean square algorithm. Gradient descent based algorithm is one of the widely used blind adaptation schemes for equalization purpose. The most commonly and widely used gradient descent based blind adaptation algorithm is the Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA) which suffers from the same poor convergence property. Also constant modulus algorithm is phase blind. In this work, authors have presented a new modified CMA Algorithm for blind equalization. The modified update equation is based on logarithmic cost function.

Automatic detection of soil macronutrients is beneficial in recording soil nutrient variability for soil reports. The data obtained from the system is printed in these reports along with soil sample number. Ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) are a favorable approach due to their small size, quick response, and ability to directly measure the analytic solution. These sensors provide the conversion of chemical information into an electrical signal. The control unit consisting of Arduino Uno converts this analog information and provides suitable data to the output unit consisting of LCD and printer. With the increased capability of modern automatic titrations it is possible to measure ion content in minutes using an ion-selective electrode (ISE).","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Soil","Soil measurements","Ions","Sensors","Electrodes","Temperature measurement","Potassium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrodes","geophysical techniques","sensors","soil"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic soil sample testing","ion selective electrode","soil properties","sensor","automatic soil macronutrient detection","soil nutrient variability","Arduino Uno","LCD","printer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Arduino","Electroconductivity","Ion-selective electrode (ISE)","LabVIEW"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754567","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7736795/7754082/07754567.pdf","startPage":"2176","endPage":"2179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754567","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic testing of soil samples using ion selective electrodes (ISEs)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7754567","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automatic testing of soil samples using ion selective electrodes (ISEs)","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7754567/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7754567/","accessionNumber":"16488785","conferenceDate":"6-8 April 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 April 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic testing of soil samples using ion selective electrodes (ISEs)","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"ICCSP986.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050847S","chronDate":"6-8 April 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7736795","isNumber":"7754082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7736795","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7754082","articleId":"7754567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7754573,"authors":[{"name":"Neha Sadhvi","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunication Department, Sathyabama University, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Neha","lastName":"Sadhvi","id":"37086206181"},{"name":"Astha Kumari","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunication Department, Sathyabama University, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Astha","lastName":"Kumari","id":"37085667054"},{"name":"T.

Before optimization, the technique of screening was applied to determine the most influent geometrical parameters on the static force characteristic. For this purpose, the response function was chosen to be the root square of the average of squares of the relative force for five values of the air gap, uniformly distributed on the range. From three parameters taken into account, the coil shape ratio and the support thickness ratio were found having the best influence as well as their interaction. The optimization problem is the maximization of static force characteristic maintaining the global dimensions of electromagnet (external radius, height of carcass, height of plunger with support) and the cross-section of the coil. To solve the optimization problem, the method by zooms without computation of models was used. The optimal solution brings a gain of 3.00% in static force for air-gap of 36 mm and an average gain of 1.12% in static force related to the whole range of the air-gap. These values were strongly limited by the equality constraints. The numerical experiments were performed using FEMM software and the magnetic force was computed using the Maxwell Stress Tensor approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICATE.2016.7754609","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Applied and Theoretical Electricity (ICATE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Applied and Theoretical Electricity (ICATE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7738604/7754593/07754609.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICATE.2016.7754609","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754593","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of DC electromagnet using design of experiments and FEM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7754609","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of DC electromagnet using design of experiments and FEM","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7754609/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16498378","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7754609/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of DC electromagnet using design of experiments and FEM","confLoc":"Craiova, Romania","sourcePdf":"0205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07641S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7738604","isNumber":"7754593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7738604","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7754593","articleId":"7754609","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7754749,"authors":[{"name":"Aytha Ramesh Kumar","affiliation":["Department of ECE, VNR VJIET, Hyderabad, India"],"bio":{"p":["A Ramesh Kumar received the M.Tech degree in VLSI Design from BIHER, Chennai, India, and pursuing Ph.D. from Osmania University, Hyderabad, India.

Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is a type of leukemia which is more common in children. The term `Acute' means that leukemia can progress quickly and if not treated may lead to fatal death within few months. Due to its non specific nature of the symptoms and signs of ALL leads wrong diagnosis. Even hematologist finds it difficult to classify the leukemia cells, there manual classification of blood cells is not only time consuming but also inaccurate. Therefore, early identification of leukemia yields in providing the appropriate treatment to the patient. As a solution to this problem the system propose individuates in the blood image the leucocytes from the blood cells, and then it selects the lymphocyte cells. It evaluates morphological index from those cells and finally it classifies the presence of leukemia. In this paper a literature review is been conducted on various techniques used for detecting cancer cells.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7754751","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7731602/7754737/07754751.pdf","startPage":"596","endPage":"600","doi":"10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7754751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of blood cancer in microscopic images of human blood samples: A review","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 March 2016","displayDocTitle":"Detection of blood cancer in microscopic images of human blood samples: A review","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7754751/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"16487247","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7754751/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of blood cancer in microscopic images of human blood samples: A review","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046979S","chronDate":"3-5 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7731602","isNumber":"7754737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7731602","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7754737","articleId":"7754751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7754760,"authors":[{"name":"Farhana Kausar","affiliation":["Atria Institute of Technology, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Farhana","lastName":"Kausar","id":"37086209996"},{"name":"P.

At present it's very uncommon to see a person without using mobile phones. Due to Increasing mobile users across globe, rising trend of multifloor and intricate designed apartments in inner-city area, poor coverage found as a key issue. To surmount this femtocell allows service providers to extend service coverage inside of home - especially where access would otherwise be limited or unavailable. It also decreases backhaul costs since it routes cellular phone traffic through the IP network. A femtocell is a miniature cellular primary station intended for use in inhabited or small industry environments. A femtocell is sometimes referred to as a residential base station, way in point base station, 3G way in point, miniature cellular primary station and private 2G-3G base station. WIMAX STD IEEE 802.16 and Long Term Evolution (LTE) femtocells provide a variety of high data rate service to the end users .LTE femtocell is being considered as the future equipment at the indoor environment[2]. Interfering alleviation between neighbouring femtocells and between the femtocell and macrocell is taken as one of the major challenges in femtocell networks because femtocells allocate the same accredited frequency spectrum with macrocell. This report provides a analysis on the different state-of-the-art methodology for noiseless and resource management in Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) based femtocell networks and offers an optimal solution[13]. One of the most crucial issues is the design of a very capable scheduling algorithm which synchronizes all other QoS-related well-designed entity.","doi":"10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7754774","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7731602/7754737/07754774.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7754774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754737","startPage":"705","endPage":"708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study on resource management system for interference mitigation in femtocell networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7754774","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Study on resource management system for interference mitigation in femtocell networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 March 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7754774/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 March 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"16487553","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7754774/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study on resource management system for interference mitigation in femtocell networks","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107136S","chronDate":"3-5 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7731602","isNumber":"7754737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7731602","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7754737","articleId":"7754774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7754798,"authors":[{"name":"Haradhan Chel","affiliation":["BTAD, Central Institute of Technology Kokrajhar, Kokrajhar, Assam, India"],"firstName":"Haradhan","lastName":"Chel","id":"37085687545"},{"name":"Deepak Mylavarapu","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Guwahati, Assam, India"],"firstName":"Deepak","lastName":"Mylavarapu","id":"37086202578"},{"name":"Deepak Sharma","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Guwahati, Assam, India"],"firstName":"Deepak","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37086131702"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9939-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-9936-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9937-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9938-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9940-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7754798","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7754798","abstract":"Sudoku is a NP complete combinatorial number placement puzzle which has been solved using various algorithms including evolutionary algorithms.

In every cycle GA works for finding better solution. The each elements of the best solution in any particular cycle undergo through a multidirectional crosscheck validation process and finally selected subject to a probability. After each cycle, group table is updated depending on the chosen elements of the best solution in the previous cycle.

neural network based method for cryptographic substitution box","abstract":"The cryptographic substitution boxes are the substantive constituent of most modern day block cryptosystems. Here, we proposed a novel method to generate cryptographically potent S-boxes by exploring the blended strength of chaos and neural network in its design. The designed chaos-based neural network, engaged to yield S-boxes, consists of four layers each of which have eight, four, two and one neuron(s), respectively. The excogitation and cognitive operation of chaotic neural network is couched to sample the random elements which eventually render infrangible configuration of S-box. By utilizing the features of chaos and neural network efficiently, we explicate cryptographically strong S-boxes that have the desired potentiality and practicability. The statistical scrutiny of proposed method against widely accepted performance measures suggest that the method is amicable to contrive dynamical S-boxes for strong block cryptosystem with respectable cryptographic features.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 March 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7754809/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16487028","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7754809/","publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"3-5 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design of chaotic neural network based method for cryptographic substitution box","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of chaotic neural network based method for cryptographic substitution box","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071743S","chronDate":"3-5 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7731602","isNumber":"7754737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7731602","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7754737","articleId":"7754809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7754817,"authors":[{"name":"Chandrashekhar Kamargaonkar","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Telecommunication, FET, Bhilai, Chhattisgarh, India"],"firstName":"Chandrashekhar","lastName":"Kamargaonkar","id":"37085872819"},{"name":"Monisha Sharma","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, FET, Bhilai, Chhattisgarh, India"],"firstName":"Monisha","lastName":"Sharma","id":"38667526600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9939-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-9936-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9937-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9938-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9940-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7754817","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":278},"abstract":"CT or MRI Medical imaging produces a digital form of human body pictures. There exists a need for compression of these images for storage and communication purposes. Current compression schemes provide a very high compression rate with a considerable loss of quality. In medicine, it is necessary to have high image quality in the region of interest, i.e. diagnostically important regions. So, ROI part can be compressed with the help of the Lossless compression, whereas the Non Region of interest part can be compressed with the help of Lossy compression as it is of lesser importance for diagnosis. In this paper Region of interest part is extracted with the help of thresholding method of segmentation and compressed with the help of SPIHT Algorithm thus producing a good quality image and NROI part is compressed with the help of Haar wavelet transform. Our algorithm provides better PSNR values for medical images.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7731602/7754737/07754817.pdf","startPage":"897","endPage":"900","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","doi":"10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7754817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7754817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754737","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7754817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid medical image compression method using SPIHT algorithm and Haar wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Wavelet transforms","Tumors","Image segmentation","Image reconstruction","Partitioning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Haar transforms","medical image processing","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid medical image compression method","SPIHT algorithm","Haar wavelet transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SPIHT(Set Partitioning In Hierarchical Tree)","Haar wavelet transform","Binary Thresholding","median filter","PSNR(Peak signal to noise ratio)","ROI","NROI"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7754817/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 March 2016","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid medical image compression method using SPIHT algorithm and Haar wavelet transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7754817/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"16487765","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"3-5 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid medical image compression method using SPIHT algorithm and Haar wavelet transform","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05573S","chronDate":"3-5 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7731602","isNumber":"7754737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7731602","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7754737","articleId":"7754817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7754820,"authors":[{"name":"Shaik Shafee","affiliation":["Dept.of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sri Venkateswara University College of Engineering, Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Shaik","lastName":"Shafee","id":"37086198614"},{"name":"B.

So fulfilling the objective to make an efficient Image Denoising technique we have proposed an Image denoising technique which is based on squared error-Stein's unbiased risk estimate linear expansion of thresholds (SURE-LET). This technique is a combination of SURE-LET and Wavelet Transform. This hybrid approach gives good result because the sparsity and multi-resonate properties of wavelet will fetch linear noise less relation matrix as well as related matrix. The SURE-LET can able to transform the unknown weight as well as the quadratic estimation with peak boundary values. The results are calculated and compared with the help of peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and mean square error (MSE). The comparative study suggests that our hybrid approach has outperformed from the previous approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7731602/7754737/07754821.pdf","startPage":"918","endPage":"923","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","doi":"10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7754821","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7754821","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754737","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7754821","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient denoising method based on SURE-LET and Wavelet Transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Image denoising","PSNR","Wavelet transforms","Encoding","Computed tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image denoising","matrix algebra","mean square error methods","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transform","SURE-LET transform","multiresonate structure","image denoising technique efficiency","squared error-Stein's unbiased risk estimate linear expansion of thresholds","linear noise less relation matrix","quadratic estimation","peak boundary values","peak signal to noise ratio","PSNR","mean square error","MSE","hybrid approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image Denoising","SURE-LET","PSNR","MSE"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7754821/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 March 2016","displayDocTitle":"An efficient denoising method based on SURE-LET and Wavelet Transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7754821/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"16497461","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"3-5 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient denoising method based on SURE-LET and Wavelet Transform","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095493S","chronDate":"3-5 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7731602","isNumber":"7754737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7731602","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7754737","articleId":"7754821","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7754828,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Workflow scheduling is the most important task in cloud computing field and users have to pay for resources that were used based in a pay-per-usage scheme. Hence Workflow scheduling plays a vital role in getting maximum benefit from the resources that are provided. Another important element to be considered about cloud computing is Load balancing. This controlling of fill assures that every exclusive machine does the very same amount of labour at any immediate of time. To make sure this, we want to recommend on using the idea of fill controlling. Here in this document, we recommend heuristic criteria known as Firefly criteria for effective fill controlling in reasoning processing. This criterion is based on the travel behaviour of the fireflies which go looking for the closest possible maximum alternatives. We employ Firefly algorithm to schedule the jobs and thereby evenly distribute the load and in turn reduce the overall completion time (makespan).","doi":"10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7754828","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7731602/7754737/07754828.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7754828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754737","startPage":"955","endPage":"960","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Workflow scheduling in cloud computing environment using firefly algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7754828","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Workflow scheduling in cloud computing environment using firefly algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 March 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7754828/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 March 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"16487241","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7754828/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Workflow scheduling in cloud computing environment using firefly algorithm","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"180.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085867S","chronDate":"3-5 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7731602","isNumber":"7754737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7731602","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7754737","articleId":"7754828","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7754872,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Reliability and Availability are most important between cloud provider and user. Fault tolerance plays a major role for using cloud services for industry and scientific specific purposes. In the present work, we focus on fault tolerance and resource allocation policies for cloud environments. In the existing system, Primary Backup (PB) model is used, but it does not contain any dynamic resource allocating mechanism. We propose a dynamic resource allocating mechanism with fault tolerance to improve resource utilization. We incorporate a backup overlapping mechanism and efficient VM migration strategy for designing novel Dynamic Fault Tolerant Scheduling Mechanism for Real Time Tasks in cloud computing. Our proposed model aims at achieving both fault tolerance and high resource utilization in the cloud.

Yang, and Yang Xiang<br> in IEEE Transactions on Computers, December 2015, pp. 3389-3403<br><br>  <br/> The cloud computing has become an efficient paradigm to run real-time and complex applications to store and manage the voluminous amount of data. Scheduling plays a major role in managing the execution of real-time applications in cloud computing environment. Cloud provider provides services to run the tasks in cloud and maintain the quality of service for its customers. To ensure the cloud provider's QoS, we propose a novel agent-based scheduling mechanism to run the customers' tasks in cloud and provide dynamic resources. In agent-based scheduling, we introduce a bidirectional announcement based bidding mechanism to allocate tasks and resources dynamically. In addition, it consists of three phases, i.e., basic matching phase, forward announcement-bidding phase and backward announcement-bidding phase. However, the scalability is necessary when scheduling is performed in dynamically adding virtual machines which gives elasticity. We have designed calculation rules for both forward and backward announcement bidding mechanism which helps for selecting contractors. The experiments are evaluated for both random synthetic workload and Google cloud tracelogs. The experiment results show that our agent-based scheduling mechanism gives better performance compared to existing methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7754883/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"16487212","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"3-5 March 2016","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: Agent based bidirectional bidding mechanism for efficient scheduling of real time tasks in cloud computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: Agent based bidirectional bidding mechanism for efficient scheduling of real time tasks in cloud computing","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09682S","chronDate":"3-5 March 2016","isNumber":"7754737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7731602","citationCount":"3","articleId":"7754883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7754884,"authors":[{"name":"Rakhi Mahanta","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, ITER, Siksha \u2018O\u2019 Anusandhan University, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India"],"firstName":"Rakhi","lastName":"Mahanta","id":"37086203864"},{"name":"Trilok Nath Pandey","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, ITER, Siksha \u2018O\u2019 Anusandhan University, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India"],"firstName":"Trilok Nath","lastName":"Pandey","id":"37086199021"},{"name":"Alok Kumar Jagadev","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, KIIT University, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India"],"firstName":"Alok Kumar","lastName":"Jagadev","id":"37658699500"},{"name":"Satchidananda Dehuri","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Technology, Fakir Mohan University, Balasore, Odisha, India"],"firstName":"Satchidananda","lastName":"Dehuri","id":"37658700600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9939-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-9936-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9937-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9938-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9940-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7754884","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":293},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stock markets","Training","Indexes","Optimization","Computational modeling","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","multilayer perceptrons","radial basis function networks","stock markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimized radial basis functional neural network","stock market index prediction","financial data mining","ANN","multilayer perceptron model","MLP","particle swarm algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MLP","RBF","PSO","Prediction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7754884","abstract":"Prediction of stock market indices is an interesting and challenging research problem in financial data mining area because movement of stock indices are nonlinear and they are dependent upon different constitutional and extraneous aspects.

Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless technology seems to meet these demands by offering increased spectral efficiency through spatial multiplexing gain, and improved link reliability due to antenna diversity gain. OFDM may be combined with antenna arrays at the transmitter and receiver to increase bandwidth efficiency and robustness using multipath signal propagation, resulting in a MIMO-OFDM configuration. The forward error correction (FEC) along with powerful interleaving algorithms plays an important role in the improvement of the performance of the MIMO-OFDM systems. In this paper we have designed a simple MIMO OFDM system with convolutional coding with code rate 1/2 and analysed the performance of the system using different antenna configuration in AWGN channel.

This paper presents the hardware implementation of AES Rijndael Encryption and Decryption Algorithm by using Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA. The hardware design approach is entirely based on pre-calculated look-up tables (LUTs) which results in less complex architecture, thereby providing high throughput and low latency. There are basically three different formats in AES. They are AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256. The encryption and decryption blocks of all the three formats are efficiently designed by using Verilog-HDL and are synthesized on Virtex-7 XC7VX690T chip (Target Device) with the help of Xilinx ISE Design Suite-14.7 Tool. The synthesis tool was set to optimize speed, area and power. The power analysis is made by using Xilinx XPower Analyzer.

But the major challenge is to address the issue of high peak to average power ratio (PAPR) in OFDM systems. To reduce the PAPR in OFDM systems, various techniques are proposed by the researchers in the literature. In this paper, a method based on companding transform technique is proposed to accomplish this challenging task. The proposed modified exponential companding transform (MECT) method is attractive for its simplicity and effectiveness for reduction of PAPR in OFDM systems. The performance of the proposed one is evaluated using computational measure, bit error rate (BER). MECT method offers an improved BER and minimized out-of-band interference (OBI) while reducing PAPR effectively when compared to the existing PAPR reduction methods. Simulation results revealed the efficacy of the proposed MECT method in PAPR reduction of OFDM systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and

resolve power quality aberrations. Investigation for an optimal controller in switching the DC capacitor in APF had been incessant. To achieve the required level of total harmonic distortion (THD), the conventional PI Controller was improved with Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC). Fuzzy logic can be termed as universilization of classical data. In fuzzy logic, also called as diffuse logic, just two alternatives will not be considered but truth values for propositions of complete content. However, tuning the fuzzy membership functions proved to be an obscure and extensive process. This paper presents a Genetic Algorithm optimized Fuzzy Logic Controller (GA-FLC) ameliorating the memberships of the heuristic controller giving impetus to the creditable shunt active power filter. This paper presents the importance of fuzzy controller to reduce total harmonic distortions in the system with shunt active filter. Total harmonic content in source current was shown when the shunt active filter was implemented with fuzzy controller. THD was limited with the use of fuzzy controller than compared to PI controller.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 March 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755017/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16487796","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7755017/","publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"3-5 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm optimized fuzzy logic controller for Shunt Active Power Filter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Genetic Algorithm optimized fuzzy logic controller for Shunt Active Power Filter","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"350.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050731S","chronDate":"3-5 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7731602","isNumber":"7754737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7731602","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7754737","articleId":"7755017","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7755030,"authors":[{"name":"Mike Trent","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Technology, Central Michigan University, Mount Pleasant, Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"Trent","id":"37086156221"},{"name":"Kevin Laubhan","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Technology, Central Michigan University, Mount Pleasant, Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Laubhan","id":"37085355710"},{"name":"Ahmed Abdelgawad","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Technology, Central Michigan University, Mount Pleasant, Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Abdelgawad","id":"37085456912"},{"name":"Kumar Yelamarthi","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Technology, Central Michigan University, Mount Pleasant, Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Kumar","lastName":"Yelamarthi","id":"37299380000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9939-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-9936-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9937-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9938-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9940-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7755030","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustics","Field programmable gate arrays","Navigation","Ultrasonic variables measurement","Robots","Sensor arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","field programmable gate arrays","object detection","sensor arrays","ultrasonic transducer arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based portable real-time obstacle detection system","FPGA-based portable real-time obstacle notification system","vision sensors","ultrasonic sensor array","data processing","vibration motors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","obstacle detection","embedded system","sensor fusion"]}],"abstract":"There are abundant accounts of research relating to obstacle detection using vision sensors.

The architecture consists of an array of ultrasonic sensors to survey the scene, FPGA chip for data processing, and, in this scenario, vibration motors to indicate the obstacle direction. The system will be attached to a belt that can be used by a user. The FPGA is used to process the data coming from the ultrasonic sensors to detect the surrounding obstacles' distances. Accordingly, the FPGA will send the signal to the corresponding vibration motors to indicate the direction of the nearby obstacles.

In order to optimize hardware requirement of digital combinational circuits, evolutionary and innovative techniques need to be enforced at various levels such as gate level and device level. This paper presents the use of one of the evolutionary techniques, i.e., Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. It is motivated by the social behaviour of organisms for the optimal design of combinational logic circuit with a reduced gate count in MATLAB platform. Results are presented to confirm that the PSO based algorithm is superior to Human Design Method in terms of time, effort and especially the gate count required to design the digital combinational circuits. The paper shows that PSO based algorithm converges faster than other algorithms such as genetic algorithm and also reduces the computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755043","startPage":"2023","endPage":"2028","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754737","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7731602/7754737/07755043.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal design of full adder circuit using Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755043/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal design of full adder circuit using Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7755043/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16487631","publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"3-5 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 March 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal design of full adder circuit using Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"374.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068794S","chronDate":"3-5 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7731602","isNumber":"7754737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7731602","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7754737","articleId":"7755043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7755044,"authors":[{"name":"Shalini Karn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, Ranchi"],"firstName":"Shalini","lastName":"Karn","id":"37086206437"},{"name":"Arpan Malkhandi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, Ranchi"],"firstName":"Arpan","lastName":"Malkhandi","id":"37085886691"},{"name":"T.

However, High PAPR is one of the major challenging issues in the OFDM system which leads to power inefficiency and signal distortion. To solve this problem, various PAPR reduction techniques exist like SLM, PTS, PRC, Envelope Scaling, etc. The performance of selected mapping (SLM) techniques is good in case of PAPR reduction, but it requires a large number of inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) for generating the transmitting signal and due to this computational complexity of the system increases. So, we analyse here the computational complexity of various SLM PAPR reduction techniques. It is noticed that SLM with additive mapping approach reduces the computational complexity without BER degradation as compared with the conventional SLM. Also, computational complexity for M-QAM modulation is less as compared to M-PSK modulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7731602/7754737/07755055.pdf","startPage":"2082","endPage":"2087","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","doi":"10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755055","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754737","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7755055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complexity analysis of SLM PAPR reduction schemes in wireless OFDM system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Additives","Computational complexity","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","fading channels","fast Fourier transforms","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complexity analysis","SLM PAPR reduction schemes","wireless OFDM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multicarrier modulation technique","multipath fading","inverse fast Fourier transform","computational complexity","additive mapping approach","M-QAM modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","IFFT","PTS","PRC","PAPR","SLM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755055/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 March 2016","displayDocTitle":"Complexity analysis of SLM PAPR reduction schemes in wireless OFDM system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7755055/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"16487056","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"3-5 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complexity analysis of SLM PAPR reduction schemes in wireless OFDM system","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"385.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068008S","chronDate":"3-5 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7731602","isNumber":"7754737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7731602","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7754737","articleId":"7755055","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7755058,"authors":[{"name":"Kantipudi M V V Prasad","affiliation":["Visvesvaraya Technological University, Belgaum, India"],"firstName":"Kantipudi M V V","lastName":"Prasad","id":"37087820532"},{"name":"H.N.

Most of the recent communication signals such as (OFDM signals, RF signals) usually have large peak-to-average power ratio. Therefore, it has an impact on enhancing non-linearity of signals with orthonormality. Also, it maximizes the in-band distortion and out band spectral re growth. This paper aims to develop a novel adaptive approach to formulating orthonormal basis functions, which have been further carried out to enhance the numerical instability during evaluation of coefficients. The experimental prototype based proposed framework also focuses on exhibiting computational complexities associated with least square methods. Also, it keeps maintaining the convergence speed of Recursive Least Squares Algorithms (RLS). A comparative analysis in between the proposed framework and conventional systems (RLS, LMS) has been performed by obtaining the experimental and simulation results which further exhibits and validates the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755058/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 March 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7755058/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"16487378","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An efficient adaptive digital predistortion framework to achieve optimal linearization of power amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient adaptive digital predistortion framework to achieve optimal linearization of power amplifier","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"388.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060917S","chronDate":"3-5 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7731602","isNumber":"7754737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7731602","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7754737","articleId":"7755058","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":7755080,"authors":[{"name":"Khushbeen Kaur Sidhu","affiliation":["Yadavindra college of Engineering"],"firstName":"Khushbeen Kaur","lastName":"Sidhu","id":"37086211886"},{"name":"Gagandeep Kaur","affiliation":["Yadavindra college of Engineering"],"firstName":"Gagandeep","lastName":"Kaur","id":"37089119662"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9939-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-9936-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9937-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9938-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9940-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7755080","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"abstract":"The performance of multilevel linear block codes is evaluated on Rayleigh fading channel, where the frames are independent from each other and consists of fading coefficients which are constant in a particular frame.

By nature, classification is multi-objective problem, as it required optimization of multiple objectives simultaneously like accuracy, sensitivity, squared error, precision etc. Traditionally, evolutionary algorithms were used to solve multi-objective classification problem by considering it as single-objective problem, but this approach gives single solution to problem. Therefore, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are used to solve classification problem. In this paper, we have used Pareto approach to optimize neural network to solve classification problem. Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm is used to simultaneously optimize accuracy and mean squared error objectives of neural network along with local search. As slow convergence to optimal solutions is major disadvantage of evolutionary algorithm. To speed up convergence to optimal solutions hybrid technique is adopted by augmenting evolutionary technique with local search algorithm. This proposed approach gives set of Pareto optimal solutions which represent different solutions for given classification problem.","doi":"10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755105","pdfPath":"/iel7/7731602/7754737/07755105.pdf","startPage":"243","endPage":"247","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754737","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification problem solving using multi-objective optimization approach and local search","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755105/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 March 2016","displayDocTitle":"Classification problem solving using multi-objective optimization approach and local search","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16487427","publicationDate":"March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7755105/","conferenceDate":"3-5 March 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification problem solving using multi-objective optimization approach and local search","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"43.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123064S","chronDate":"3-5 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7731602","isNumber":"7754737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7731602","xplore-issue":"7754737","articleId":"7755105","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7755117,"authors":[{"name":"CharanArur Panem","affiliation":["Depaprtment Of Electronics, Goa University, Goa, India"],"firstName":"CharanArur","lastName":"Panem","id":"37086210926"},{"name":"A.

MIMO channels provide a number of advantages over conventional Single Input Single Output (SISO) channels such as the array gain, the diversity gain, and the multiplexing gain. In this paper we have introduce sensor level Data Fusion for 2\u00d72 MIMO system. We have discussed generalized MIMO systems wherein the signals on the transmitting (Tx) antennas and the receiving (Rx) antennas for the quality (bit-error rate or BER) or the data rate (bits/sec) of the channel for each MIMO. We focus on the Spatial Multiplexing technique of MIMO systems. Here different fading channels like AWGN are used for analysis purpose. The 2\u00d72 MIMO system performance is analyzed in terms of BER (bit error rate) v/s SNR (signal to noise ratio). The system is customized for the Quadcopter for the sensors, like gyrometer, accelerometer and temperature to transmit them over the wireless channel for optimum bandwidth utilization. The said system is demonstrated for the proper BER over RC-channel at bandwidth of 2.4GHz over RF frequency of 3-30MHz.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7731602/7754737/07755117.pdf","startPage":"2361","endPage":"2365","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","doi":"10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754737","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7755117","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensors data fusion architecture over MIMO: Case study of quad copter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Data integration","Receiving antennas","Sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerometers","aircraft antennas","aircraft communication","antenna arrays","AWGN channels","error statistics","fading channels","helicopters","MIMO communication","receiving antennas","sensor fusion","space division multiplexing","temperature sensors","transmitting antennas","UHF detectors","UHF measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadcopter","wireless communication system","multiple receiving antenna","multiple transmitting antenna","single antenna system","multipath channel","single input single output channel","multiplexing gain","array gain","diversity gain","sensor level data fusion architecture","generalized MIMO channel system","SISO channel","bit-error rate","BER","spatial multiplexing technique","fading channel","AWGN channel","SNR","signal to noise ratio","gyrometer","accelerometer","temperature sensor","wireless channel","optimum bandwidth utilization","RC-channel","bandwidth 2.4 GHz","frequency 3 MHz to 30 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","DtataRate","Capacity","SNR","BER","Kalman filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755117/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 March 2016","displayDocTitle":"Sensors data fusion architecture over MIMO: Case study of quad copter","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7755117/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"16497440","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"3-5 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensors data fusion architecture over MIMO: Case study of quad copter","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"440.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085558S","chronDate":"3-5 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7731602","isNumber":"7754737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7731602","xplore-issue":"7754737","articleId":"7755117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7755130,"authors":[{"name":"S.

We are comparing the conventional PWM scheme to the proposed Artificial neural network. Here simulation results reveal that the ANN controllers are very effective and efficient compared to the PI and Fuzzy controllers, because the steady state error in case of ANN control is less and the stabilization if the system is better in it. Also in the ANN methodology the time taken for computation is less since there is no mathematical model.

To traverse a particular environment a device needs to know its destination and also avoid dangerous situations like obstacles and collisions. The purpose of this paper is to design an FPGA based navigation platform using a rotation encoder to guide any navigation device through set distances in both forward and reverse directions and to control the directions. The device should utilize the parameters from the rotation encoder and effectively traverse a given location by following predetermined paths loaded in the controller. The rotation encoder calculates number of pulses per rotation which can be used to calculate distance travelled in a given time, provided speed is known. To design a rotation encoder we have used an optical detector IC MOC7811. This helps to move the device forward and backward according to the number of pulses which gets translated into distance. In case of directions during the course of the project it was found that the same properties of the rotation encoder which enables a device to move forward and backward can also be used to make turns. With continuous trials recorded accuracy was also fairly high.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA based navigation platform for fixed path navigation with distance estimation using rotation encoder","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","doi":"10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755279","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7731602/7754737/07755279.pdf","startPage":"3134","endPage":"3138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754737","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7755279","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755279/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 March 2016","displayDocTitle":"FPGA based navigation platform for fixed path navigation with distance estimation using rotation encoder","conferenceDate":"3-5 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7755279/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"16487493","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA based navigation platform for fixed path navigation with distance estimation using rotation encoder","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"587.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081863S","chronDate":"3-5 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7731602","isNumber":"7754737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7731602","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7754737","articleId":"7755279","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7755295,"authors":[{"name":"B.

State estimation can be done using stochastic estimators. Kalman filter is one of the linear stochastic estimators. Kalman filtering technique is used to track the target in several applications like radar applications, navigation systems, surveillance systems, communication systems, embedded applications etc. In this paper, we study about Kalman filter, Particle Swarm Optimization and fuzzy logic. In the presence of noise, the performance of Kalman filter is altered. Hence the noise power spectral densities are optimized using PSO and then filtering technique is used. For further improvement in the reduction of error in estimation, we analyze the incorporation of fuzzy logic to Kalman filter. The performance of Kalman filter and its combination with PSO and fuzzy logic is compared for tracking a maneuvering target.","doi":"10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755295","startPage":"3204","endPage":"3208","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7731602/7754737/07755295.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754737","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of Kalman filter with Particle Swarm Optimization and fuzzy logic","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kalman filters","Fuzzy logic","Target tracking","Noise measurement","Covariance matrices","State estimation","Particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy logic","Kalman filters","particle swarm optimisation","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PSO","noise power spectral densities","target tracking","linear stochastic estimators","state estimation","system characteristics","fuzzy logic","particle swarm optimization","Kalman filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fuzzy logic","Kalman filter","PSO","target tracking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755295/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 March 2016","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of Kalman filter with Particle Swarm Optimization and fuzzy logic","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7755295/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"3-5 March 2016","accessionNumber":"16497446","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of Kalman filter with Particle Swarm Optimization and fuzzy logic","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"600.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074908S","chronDate":"3-5 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7731602","isNumber":"7754737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7731602","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7754737","articleId":"7755295","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7755301,"authors":[{"name":"Niranjan Muchandi","affiliation":["Dept. of E & C Engg., Jain College of Engineering, Belagavi, India"],"firstName":"Niranjan","lastName":"Muchandi","id":"37086211629"},{"name":"Rajashri Khanai","affiliation":["Dept. of E & C Engg., KLE Dr.M S Sheshgiri College of Engineering and Technology, Belagavi, India"],"firstName":"Rajashri","lastName":"Khanai","id":"37085557640"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9939-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-9936-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9937-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9938-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9940-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7755301","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2752},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Cognitive radio","Interference","Wireless sensor networks","FCC","Matched filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio spectrum sensing scheme","wireless communication","CR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","spectrum sensing","cognitive cycle","cooperative sensing","signal processing sensing technique"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive radio spectrum sensing: A survey","doi":"10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754737","endPage":"3237","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7731602/7754737/07755301.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755301","startPage":"3233","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7755301","abstract":"Cognitive Radio (CR) is a promising technology to improve the spectrum utilization efficiency.

The envelope of complex background noise is modelled as Nakagami-m distribution. However, the phase of the complex background noise is assumed to follow two different distributions, 1) Uniform distribution and 2) Hoyt distribution.

The binary watermark is then embedded into the DCT coefficients of another set of selected blocks (8\u00d78) using Spread Spectrum (SS) modulation. The block-based watermarking is semi-fragile in nature, which in turn leads to tamper detection for the content of the host data. The percentage matching between the extracted and the generated watermark at the watermark decoding end indicates the amount of tempering made on the host data (authentication of content). On the other hand removal of watermark signal from the watermarked image by reversible process leads to quality access control by authentic used. Experimental results show that the proposed hardware based watermarking system features low power consumption, low cost implementation, high processing speed, and reliability.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7731602/7754737/07755321.pdf","startPage":"3324","endPage":"3329","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","doi":"10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755321","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754737","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7755321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reversable data hiding for content verification and quality access control of image and its hardware implementaion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Discrete cosine transforms","Hardware","Decoding","Generators","Signal processing algorithms","Read only memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","data encapsulation","discrete cosine transforms","set theory","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reversable data hiding","content verification","image quality access control","hardware implementaion","reversible watermarking system","semi-fragile watermark information","digital image","content dependent binary watermark","discrete cosine transform","binary watermark","DCT coefficients","spread spectrum modulation","SS","block-based watermarking","tamper detection","host data","percentage matching","watermark decoding","watermarked image","power consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Content Dependent Watermarking","DCT","VHDL","FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755321/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 March 2016","displayDocTitle":"Reversable data hiding for content verification and quality access control of image and its hardware implementaion","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7755321/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"16497418","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"3-5 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reversable data hiding for content verification and quality access control of image and its hardware implementaion","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"624.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04899S","chronDate":"3-5 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7731602","isNumber":"7754737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7731602","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7754737","articleId":"7755321","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7755335,"authors":[{"name":"Ch.

The facecan be recognized by 2-D and 3-D face recognition techniques. Face recognition has various challenges such as, occlusion, pose variations, illumination variations, and expression variations in probe and gallery faces. In this paper challenges due to illumination variations are addressed using shearlet based face recognition method. Illumination invariant face recognition is achieved with the use of logarithmic transformation and is followed by forward shearlet transform. The 2-D discrete shearlet transform provides high performance and computational efficiency than the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), in multi-directional transform domain. In order to remove illumination variations, low frequency approximate component of shearlet coefficients have made null. Subsequently the inverse shearlet transform is computed which results in a spatial domain image. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) feature extraction technique has used to extract features. The proposed technique is experimented on the Extended Yale B face database.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A shearlet transform based illumination invariant 2-D face recognition","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","doi":"10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755336","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7731602/7754737/07755336.pdf","startPage":"3407","endPage":"3412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755336","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754737","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7755336","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755336/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 March 2016","displayDocTitle":"A shearlet transform based illumination invariant 2-D face recognition","conferenceDate":"3-5 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7755336/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"16487732","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A shearlet transform based illumination invariant 2-D face recognition","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"638.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082942S","chronDate":"3-5 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7731602","isNumber":"7754737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7731602","xplore-issue":"7754737","articleId":"7755336","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7755364,"authors":[{"name":"Ipsita Kar","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, KIIT University, Bhubaneswar, India"],"firstName":"Ipsita","lastName":"Kar","id":"37086198336"},{"name":"R.N.

However, energy consumption is one of the important concerns in cloud environment as large amount of energy is wasted by the data centers, hosting cloud applications and the carbon dioxide gas is released into the atmosphere polluting the environment. So pollution needs to be reduced by lowering the energy usage. Therefore, we'd prefer to propose a green computing solution which is not only able to minimize makespan and operational costs however in addition to minimize the environmental pollution. In this paper, we tend to stipulate a framework that specifies energy minimization is a generalization of makespan minimized by using the Energy-Aware Task Scheduler using Genetic Algorithm. We tried to conduct a survey on different scheduling methods of energy minimization in cloud data centers and their limitations and at the end of this paper, we render a green optimized energy-aware task scheduling algorithm for Cloud data centers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 March 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755364/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16497413","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7755364/","publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"3-5 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Energy aware scheduling using genetic algorithm in cloud data centers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy aware scheduling using genetic algorithm in cloud data centers","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"663.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0891S","chronDate":"3-5 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7731602","isNumber":"7754737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7731602","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7754737","articleId":"7755364","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7755376,"authors":[{"name":"Shiv Prakash","affiliation":["Division of ICE, NSIT, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Shiv","lastName":"Prakash","id":"37086204405"},{"name":"Ankur Bansal","affiliation":["Division of ECE, NSIT, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Ankur","lastName":"Bansal","id":"37528658300"},{"name":"Shyama Kant Jha","affiliation":["Division of ICE, NSIT, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Shyama Kant","lastName":"Jha","id":"37857267700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9939-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-9936-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9937-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9938-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9940-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7755376","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise measurement","Laplace equations","Signal to noise ratio","Binary phase shift keying","Probability density function","Mathematical model","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","Gaussian noise","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["narrowband PLC system","Gaussian Laplacian noise model","power line communication system","Gaussian distributed background noise","nonGaussian impulsive noise","binary phase shift keying","BPSK modulation scheme","Laplace distribution","Bernoulli sequence","error rate analysis","outage analysis","probability density function","PDF","bit error rate","BER","outage probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power line communications (PLC)","binary phase shift keying (BPSK)","bit error rate (BER)","background noise","Impulsive noise","Gaussian noise","Laplacian noise","probability density function (PDF)","signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)"]}],"abstract":"This paper focuses on the performance of power line communication (PLC) system in the presence of a Gaussian distributed background noise and a non-Gaussian impulsive noise, using binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation scheme.

The main aim of 4G wireless systems is to provide users with high speed and high performance in different channel conditions. 4G systems support interactive multimedia, voice, streaming video, internet and other broad band services. 4G is a IP based mobile system with high speed, high capacity and low cost per bit. Orthogonal Frequency Division multiplexing (OFDM) is one of the most promising techniques to meet the challenges. A Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) system utilizes multiple number of antennas both at transmitter and receiver. This paper presents the performance of OFDM-OSTBC system under various fading channels using different Doppler spectra. Simulation results shows that for two transmitting antennas and one receiving antenna the Bit Error Rate (BER) for OFDM-OSTBC system is observed to be 0.03919 at SNR 6dB and for three transmitting antennas and two receiving antennas the Bit Error Rate (BER) for OFDM-OSTBC system is observed to be 0.0013 at same SNR. It has been observed that BER is low for flat Doppler spectrum. Hence by using MIMO system ie., by implementing both transmit and receive diversity bit error rate (BER) is reduced. With reduced Bit Error Rate (BER), it is possible to achieve high bit rate.","doi":"10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755438","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7731602/7754737/07755438.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754737","startPage":"396","endPage":"399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of OFDM-OSTBC system under various fading channels using different Doppler spectra","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7755438","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of OFDM-OSTBC system under various fading channels using different Doppler spectra","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 March 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755438/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 March 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"16487748","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7755438/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of OFDM-OSTBC system under various fading channels using different Doppler spectra","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"73.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083122S","chronDate":"3-5 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7731602","isNumber":"7754737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7731602","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7754737","articleId":"7755438","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7755470,"authors":[{"name":"Mandakini Gupta","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE, VITM, Gwalior, India"],"firstName":"Mandakini","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37086199547"},{"name":"Abhishek Jain","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE, VITM, Gwalior, India"],"firstName":"Abhishek","lastName":"Jain","id":"37086206187"},{"name":"Ankur Soni","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE, VITM, Gwalior, India"],"firstName":"Ankur","lastName":"Soni","id":"37086209776"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9939-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-9936-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9937-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9938-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9940-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7755470","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7755470","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Sensors","Software radio","Software","Hardware","Radio transmitters","TV"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","multi-access systems","radio spectrum management","signal detection","software radio","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software defined radio","primary user emulsion attack","PUE attack","spectrum sensing","wireless cognitive radio network","wireless signal","secondary users","emission characteristics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","PU Emulsion Attack (PUE)","Fallow Licensed Spectrum Band","Software Defined Radio"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755470","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7731602/7754737/07755470.pdf","startPage":"4029","endPage":"4034","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754737","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A survey: Render of PUE attack in cognitive radio compressed by software defined radio","abstract":"PU Emulsion attack is one of the most important Threats of Spectrum sensing for wireless Cognitive Radio Network.

Most of the existing models for forecasting are linear in nature. As a result these models fail to predict correctly when the input attributes are nonlinear. To overcome this limitation this study develops a Functional Link Artificial Neural Network (FLANN) and Non-liner Regression (NLR) for identifying new product growth rate for three different industries from manufacturing sectors such as Electronic, Construction, Auto and Auto component. The desire nonlinearity to the FLANN model is introduced by trigonometric expansion of the input features.

Also, a wireless communication is demanding multi-band transmitter and receiver, so the design to get optimum efficiency and linearity in power amplifiers in multi-band applications becomes more and more challenging day by day. As such, a lot of work has been performed to design highly efficient and linear power amplifiers. The basic class E power amplifier and the cascode circuit of the class E power amplifier has been implemented and operated at two different frequencies (1.7GHz and 2.4GHz) to see the effect on the linearity parameter of PA. The voltage supply of 2.5V has been used and the input power of 12dBm.

The electrical length of the microstrip circular patch is increased by incorporating slots as fractals, achieving area reduction and better isolation in comparison with parent crossover. For the enhancement of isolation and transmission fractals is implemented by means of Sierpinski method and three iterations are done.

The procedure involves capturing images using various cell phones like Samsung, Nokia and Lenova having resolution of 2 mega pixels, 3 mega pixels and 5 mega pixels respectively. The scope of the work includes image acquisition using cell phones of various resolutions. The captured images are subjected to histogram analysis as an indication of preprocessing. The histogram equalization and clipping is done to increase the global contrast and reduce the dynamic range. Then Transportation Map Registration (TMR) filter is used for removing any artifacts present in the extracted images. Feed Forward Neural Network (FNN) trained with Back Propagation Algorithm (BPA) is used for efficient retrieval of the images based on its content. The wavelet transform is used to estimate the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), Resolution Synthesis Color Correction (RSCC) and Generalized Gaussian mixture model (GGMM). The output of this enhancement algorithm is used to get an optimized result. The performance of the proposed method to other existing color correction algorithms on cell phone camera (various resolution) images obtained from different sources are compared. The subjective and objective quality analysis is carried out to substantiate the improved quality of the proposed algorithm over the existing methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7731602/7754737/07755561.pdf","startPage":"4451","endPage":"4457","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","doi":"10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755561","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754737","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7755561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image enhancement in cell phone cameras using wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Histograms","Cameras","Cellular phones","Image resolution","Digital filters","Wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","Gaussian processes","image capture","image colour analysis","image enhancement","image filtering","image registration","image resolution","mixture models","neural nets","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image enhancement","wavelet transform","color correction algorithm","digital images","low resolution cell phone cameras","Samsung","Nokia","Lenovo","image acquisition","histogram analysis","histogram equalization","global contrast","transportation map registration","TMR filter","feed forward neural network","FNN","back propagation algorithm","BPA","resolution synthesis color correction","RSCC","generalized Gaussian mixture model","GGMM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Color Enhancement","cell phone camera","resolution synthesis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755561/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 March 2016","displayDocTitle":"Image enhancement in cell phone cameras using wavelet transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7755561/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"16487585","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","conferenceDate":"3-5 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image enhancement in cell phone cameras using wavelet transform","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"840.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064253S","chronDate":"3-5 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7731602","isNumber":"7754737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7731602","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7754737","articleId":"7755561","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7755580,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The transformer less dc-dc converters are used to achieve high step up voltage gain without an extremely large duty ratio. In this paper, the closed loop control of dual switch converter with passive lossless clamping for high step up voltage gain has been investigated. The improved dual switch converter can achieve high voltage gain with a condition that the parameters are inconsistent. It has advantages of low voltage and current stress on the switches compared to the transformer less dc-dc converters. The proposed converter also provides the solution to balance the voltage on the switches and to suppress the resonance. This is possible due to the presence of passive lossless clamping. With the passive lossless clamping circuits, low voltage switches with small Rds (on) can be utilized, and hence the efficiency of the converter can be increased. The simulation of the circuit with 30 V input, 100V/1A output is done using MATLAB. The simulation results indicate an improved voltage waveform with high step up voltage gain.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755582","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7731602/7754737/07755582.pdf","startPage":"460","endPage":"464","doi":"10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755582","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closed loop control of an improved dual switch converter with passive lossless clamping for high step-up voltage gain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 March 2016","displayDocTitle":"Closed loop control of an improved dual switch converter with passive lossless clamping for high step-up voltage gain","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7755582/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"16487690","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755582/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed loop control of an improved dual switch converter with passive lossless clamping for high step-up voltage gain","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"86.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056022S","chronDate":"3-5 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7731602","isNumber":"7754737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7731602","xplore-issue":"7754737","articleId":"7755582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7755586,"authors":[{"name":"Rohan Srivastava","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Gautam Buddha University, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Rohan","lastName":"Srivastava","id":"37086204610"},{"name":"Yogesh K.

nearly equal to that of a two stage op-amp. The proposed design is implemented in GPDK 0.18\u03bcm CMOS technology. This op-amp uses a folded cascode structure in the output stage combined with the differential amplifier having PMOS input transistors to achieve good input common mode range and lower flicker noise. It has an important feature that it allows the input common mode level close to supply voltage. The proposed topology improves the PSRR of op-amp which can be used for LDO applications. Simulations using Cadence under 1.8 V show a DC gain of 72.0404 dB and a phase margin of 62.4636 degree at a unity gain bandwidth of 13.33 MHz with the power consumption smaller than 0.13 mW along with a PSRR of 72.0966 dB.

The effects on channel capacity of Single-User MIMO (SU-MIMO) systems in urban scenarios have been previously studied [3]. It has been clarified that the larger number of antennas cannot contribute the improvement on the channel capacity in urban SU-MIMO scenarios due to very high spatial correlation. In this paper, we focus on the MU-MIMO transmission because it can discriminate multiple users by the difference of Angle of Arrival (AoA). We compare the Multi Access Channel (MAC) capacity in uplink with the channel capacity in SU-MIMO by setting the total numbers of transmitting and receiving antennas of SU-MIMO and MU-MIMO to be the same. When the same numbers of antenna elements are used, the better performance is obtained with MU-MIMO in urban scenarios, unlike identical independent distributed (I.I.D.) channels which are generally assumed in MIMO transmission. We also clarify an interesting relationship between the channel capacity improvement of MU-MIMO compared with SU-MIMO and a path visibility.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel capacity characteristics of multi-user MIMO systems in urban area","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","doi":"10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755654","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7731602/7754737/07755654.pdf","startPage":"4907","endPage":"4911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7754737","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7755654","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755654/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 March 2016","displayDocTitle":"Channel capacity characteristics of multi-user MIMO systems in urban area","conferenceDate":"3-5 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7755654/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"16497411","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel capacity characteristics of multi-user MIMO systems in urban area","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"924.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094043S","chronDate":"3-5 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7731602","isNumber":"7754737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7731602","xplore-issue":"7754737","articleId":"7755654","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7755655,"authors":[{"name":"P.

These data can be used by companies for marketing surveys or decision making. However, collecting sensing data from other users may violate their privacy. Moreover, the data aggregator and/or the participants of crowdsensing may be untrusted entities. Recent studies have proposed randomized response schemes for anonymized data collection. This kind of data collection can analyze the sensing data of users statistically without precise information about other users' sensing results. However, traditional randomized response schemes and their extensions require a large number of samples to achieve proper estimation. In this paper, we propose a new anonymized data-collection scheme that can estimate data distributions more accurately. Using simulations with synthetic and real datasets, we prove that our proposed method can reduce the mean squared error and the JS divergence by more than 85% as compared with other existing studies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755727/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7755727/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16636484","volume":"12","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Differential Private Data Collection and Analysis Based on Randomized Multiple Dummies for Untrusted Mobile Crowdsensing","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"JSPS KAKENHI","grantNumber":"26330081, 26870201 and 16K12411"},{"fundingName":"Telecommunications Advancement Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential Private Data Collection and Analysis Based on Randomized Multiple Dummies for Untrusted Mobile Crowdsensing","sourcePdf":"tifs-sei-2632069-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106648S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7831515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7831515","articleId":"7755727","onlineDate":"23 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7755728,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Yazdanbakhsh","affiliation":["Alternative Computing Technologies (ACT) Lab, School of Computer Science, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Amir Yazdanbakhsh is currently working toward a PhD in the School of Computer Science, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA, where he works as a Research Assistant in the Alternative Computing Technologies (ACT) Lab.

However, cloud data disclosure happens more and more frequently, which makes cloud data security and privacy protection impact wide adoption of cloud storage. Control cloud data access based on reputation by introducing a Reputation Center (RC) was proposed and demonstrated to secure cloud data effectively in [9] . But the acceptance of such a system by cloud users and Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) is crucial for its practical deployment and final success. In this paper, we investigate the acceptance of a cloud data access control system based on reputation using Game Theory. Due to the existence of dishonest CSPs, there exists a social reputation dilemma among CSPs, which seriously impedes the popularity of cloud storage. To encourage users to use cloud storage and suppress collusion between CSPs and data requesters, a repeated public-goods game is built up by applying a compensation mechanism to improve the utilities of cloud users and a punishment mechanism based on reputation to incent honest behaviors. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show the effectiveness of the compensation and punishment mechanisms to increase cloud storage rate and restrain dishonest system entities.","doi":"10.1109/TCC.2016.2632110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9280471","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCC.2016.2632110","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245519/9280471/07755733.pdf","startPage":"1003","endPage":"1017","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Game Theoretical Analysis on Acceptance of a Cloud Data Access Control System Based on Reputation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Game Theoretical Analysis on Acceptance of a Cloud Data Access Control System Based on Reputation","volume":"8","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2020","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2020","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7755733/","publicationDate":"1 Oct.-Dec. 2020","accessionNumber":"20261865","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755733/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFB0800704"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61672410 and U1536202"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China","grantNumber":"2016ZDJC-06"},{"fundingName":"Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China","grantNumber":"JY0300130104"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013314","fundingName":"Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project","grantNumber":"B08038 and B16037"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002666","fundingName":"Aalto-Yliopisto"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Game Theoretical Analysis on Acceptance of a Cloud Data Access Control System Based on Reputation","sourcePdf":"tcc-yan-2632110-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.193142S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"6245519","isNumber":"9280471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245519","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"9280471","articleId":"7755733","onlineDate":"23 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7755740,"authors":[{"name":"Kenneth Ray Ball","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA","Human Research and Engineering Directorate, U.S.\u00a0Army Research Laboratory, Aberdeen, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/8013177/7755740/ball-2632119-small.gif","p":["Kenneth R.

Methods: The method, band limited atomic sampling with spectral tuning (BLASST), is an iterative approach that is designed to 1) fit nonstationarities in line noise by searching for best-fit Gabor atoms at predetermined time points, 2) self-modulate its fit by leveraging information from frequencies surrounding the target frequency, and 3) terminate based on a convergence criterion obtained from the same surrounding frequencies. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we generate several simulated and real instances of nonstationary line noise and test BLASST along with alternative filtering approaches. Results: We find that BLASST is capable of fitting line noise well and/or preserving local signal features relative to tested alternative filtering techniques. Conclusion: BLASST may present a useful alternative to bandpass, notch, or other filtering methods when experimentally relevant features have significant power in a spectrum that is contaminated by utility line noise, or when the line noise in question is highly nonstationary. Significance: This is of particular significance in electroencephalography experiments, where line noise may be present in the frequency bands of neurological interest and measurements are typically of low enough strength that induced line noise can dominate the recorded signals. In conjunction with this paper, the authors have released a MATLAB toolbox that performs BLASST on real, vector-valued signals (available at https://github.com/VisLab/blasst).","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2016.2632119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2016.2632119","startPage":"2276","endPage":"2287","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/8013177/07755740.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8013177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BLASST: Band Limited Atomic Sampling With Spectral Tuning With Applications to Utility Line Noise Filtering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","displayDocTitle":"BLASST: Band Limited Atomic Sampling With Spectral Tuning With Applications to Utility Line Noise Filtering","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2017","volume":"64","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7755740/","accessionNumber":"17135450","pubMedId":"27893379","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755740/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Army Research Laboratory and was accomplished under Cooperative Agreement Number","grantNumber":"W911NF-10-2-0022"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BLASST: Band Limited Atomic Sampling With Spectral Tuning With Applications to Utility Line Noise Filtering","sourcePdf":"tbme-ball-2632119-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079795S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"8013177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","xplore-issue":"8013177","articleId":"7755740","onlineDate":"23 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7755741,"authors":[{"name":"Sayeed Shafayet Chowdhury","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Sayeed Shafayet","lastName":"Chowdhury","id":"37086003579"},{"name":"Rakib Hyder","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Rakib","lastName":"Hyder","id":"37089042999"},{"name":"Md.

However, placing PPG sensors in wrist causes much stronger and complicated motion artifacts (MA) due to loose interface between sensors and skin. Therefore, developing robust HR estimation algorithms for wrist-type PPG signals has significant commercial values. In this paper, we propose a robust HR estimation algorithm for wrist-type PPG signals using multiple reference adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) technique-termed here as \u201cMURAD.\u201d The main challenge of using ANC for MA reduction is to devise a qualified reference noise signal (RNS) to the adaptive filter. We propose a novel solution by using four RNSs, namely, the three-axis accelerometer data and the difference signal between the two PPG signals. For each RNS, we get a different version of the cleaned PPG signal. Then, a set of probable HR values is estimated using all of the cleaned PPG signals, and then, the value that is closest to the estimated HR of the previous time window is chosen to be the HR estimate of the current window. Then, some peak verification techniques are employed to ensure accurate HR estimations. The proposed technique gives lower average absolute error compared to state-of-the art methods. So, MURAD method provides a promising solution to the challenge of HR monitoring using PPG in wearable devices during severe MA conditions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heart rate","Estimation","Accelerometers","Robustness","Acceleration","Noise cancellation","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerometers","adaptive filters","cardiology","medical signal processing","patient monitoring","photoplethysmography","signal denoising"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cleaned PPG signal","wrist-type PPG signals","photoplethysmographic signals","PPG sensors","multiple reference adaptive noise cancellation technique","qualified reference noise signal","real-time robust heart rate estimation","heart rate monitoring","wearable devices","motion artifacts","HR estimation algorithm","MURAD","adaptive filter","three-axis accelerometer data","peak verification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive noise cancellation (ANC)","heart rate (HR) monitoring","motion artifact (MA)","periodogram","photoplethysmography (PPG)","recursive least-squares (RLS) adaptive filter"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Artifacts","Female","Heart Rate","Humans","Least-Squares Analysis","Middle Aged","Models, Cardiovascular","Photoplethysmography","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Wrist"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2016.2632201","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221020/8306527/07755741.pdf","startPage":"450","endPage":"459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8306527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2016.2632201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Robust Heart Rate Estimation From Wrist-Type PPG Signals Using Multiple Reference Adaptive Noise Cancellation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7755741","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Robust Heart Rate Estimation From Wrist-Type PPG Signals Using Multiple Reference Adaptive Noise Cancellation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755741/","volume":"22","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7755741/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17600130","pubMedId":"27893403","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Robust Heart Rate Estimation From Wrist-Type PPG Signals Using Multiple Reference Adaptive Noise Cancellation","sourcePdf":"jbhi-haque-2632201-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077392S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"8306527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8306527","articleId":"7755741","onlineDate":"23 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7755742,"authors":[{"name":"Yancong Lin","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/7852546/7755742/lin-2632422-small.gif","p":["Yancong\u00a0Lin received the M.S. degree from the School of\n Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China.

In this paper, we propose a full reference stereo image quality assessment (SIQA) framework which focuses on the innovation of binocular visual properties and applications of low-level features. On one hand, based on the fact that human visual system understands an image mainly according to its low-level features, local phase and local amplitude extracted from phase congruency measurement are employed as primary features. Considering the less prominent performance of amplitude in IQA, visual saliency is applied into the modification on amplitude. On the other hand, by fully considering binocular rivalry phenomena, we create the cyclopean amplitude map and cyclopean phase map. With this method, both image features and binocular visual properties are mutually combined with each other. Meanwhile, a novel binocular modulation function in spatial domain is also adopted into the overall quality prediction of amplitude and phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves higher consistency with subjective tests than relevant SIQA metrics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755742/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7755742/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16669213","volume":"11","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Quality Index for Stereoscopic Images by Jointly Evaluating Cyclopean Amplitude and Cyclopean Phase","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471260 and 61271324"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006606","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin","grantNumber":"16JCYBJC16000"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quality Index for Stereoscopic Images by Jointly Evaluating Cyclopean Amplitude and Cyclopean Phase","sourcePdf":"jstsp-yang-2632422-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130388S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"7852546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7852546","articleId":"7755742","onlineDate":"23 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7755745,"authors":[{"name":"Shan Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Urban Studies and Planning, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687317/7935479/7755745/jiang-2631141-small.gif","p":["Shan Jiang received the dual bachelor's degree in urban planning\n and economics from Peking University, in 2006, the dual master's degree in city planning and transportation from\n MIT, in 2009, and the PhD degree in urban and regional planning from MIT, in 2015.

Such an approach is widely used in the transportation planning practice to develop urban micro simulations of individual daily activities and travel; yet it depends highly on detailed travel survey data to capture individual activity-based behavior. We provide an innovative data mining framework that synthesizes the state-of-the-art techniques in extracting mobility patterns from raw mobile phone CDR data, and design a pipeline that can translate the massive and passive mobile phone records to meaningful spatial human mobility patterns readily interpretable for urban and transportation planning purposes. With growing ubiquitous mobile sensing, and shrinking labor and fiscal resources in the public sector globally, the method presented in this research can be used as a low-cost alternative for transportation and planning agencies to understand the human activity patterns in cities, and provide targeted plans for future sustainable development.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755745/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 May 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1 2017","volume":"3","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"16970205","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2017","publicationDate":"1 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7755745/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Activity-Based Human Mobility Patterns Inferred from Mobile Phone Data: A Case Study of Singapore","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001321","fundingName":"National Research Foundation (NRF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001474","fundingName":"Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART)"},{"fundingName":"Center for Future Urban Mobility (FM)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003070","fundingName":"Center for Complex Engineering Systems (CCES)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004919","fundingName":"KACST"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Activity-Based Human Mobility Patterns Inferred from Mobile Phone Data: A Case Study of Singapore","sourcePdf":"tbdata-jiang-2631141-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10299S","chronDate":"June 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"6687317","isNumber":"7935479","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687317","citationCount":"164","xplore-issue":"7935479","articleId":"7755745","onlineDate":"23 May 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7755750,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Cui","affiliation":["Advanced Launching Co-innovation Center, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Cui","id":"37561701100"},{"name":"Zhongjie Ren","affiliation":["Advanced Launching Co-innovation Center, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Zhongjie","lastName":"Ren","id":"37086030919"},{"name":"Xiangyu Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Xiangyu","lastName":"Li","id":"37086122881"},{"name":"Zongkai Liu","affiliation":["Advanced Launching Co-innovation Center, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Zongkai","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086121149"},{"name":"Rihong Zhu","affiliation":["Advanced Launching Co-innovation Center, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Rihong","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086030242"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1578"}],"articleNumber":"7755750","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1206},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7755750","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Delay lines","Clocks","Radiation detectors","Ring oscillators","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay lines","field programmable gate arrays","nuclear electronics","time-digital conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","Vernier time-to-digital converter","ring-oscillator-based converter","field programmable gate array","differential nonlinearity method","long-standing problem","ring-oscillator-based Vernier style fine time interpolation","basic delay cell","Stratix III FPGA","TDC design flow","TDC channel","time 31 ps"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carry chain","field programmable gate array","high linearity","ring oscillator","time-to-digital converter","Vernier delay line"]}],"abstract":"Time-to-digital converters (TDCs) using dedicated carry chains of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are usually organized in tapped-delay-line type which are intensively researched in recent years. However this method incurs poor differential nonlinearity (DNL) which arises from the inherent uneven bin granularity. This paper proposes a TDC architecture which utilizes the carry chains in a quite different manner in order to alleviate this long-standing problem. Two independent carry chains working as the delay lines for the fine time interpolation are organized in a ring-oscillator-based Vernier style and the time difference between them is finely adjusted by assigning different number of basic delay cells. A specific design flow is described to obtain the desired delay difference. The TDC was implemented on a Stratix III FPGA. Test results show that the obtained resolution is 31 ps and the DNL\\INL is in the range of (-0.080 LSB, 0.073 LSB)\\(-0.087 LSB, 0.091 LSB). This demonstrates that the proposed architecture greatly improves linearity compared to previous techniques. Additionally the resource cost is rather low which uses only 319 LUTs and 104 registers per TDC channel.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2016.2632168","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/23/7869242/07755750.pdf","startPage":"697","endPage":"704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2016.2632168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7869242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Linearity, Ring-Oscillator-Based, Vernier Time-to-Digital Converter Utilizing Carry Chains in FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755750/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"A High-Linearity, Ring-Oscillator-Based, Vernier Time-to-Digital Converter Utilizing Carry Chains in FPGAs","dateOfInsertion":"02 March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7755750/","accessionNumber":"16721604","volume":"64","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"30916014112-019 and 30916011349"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Linearity, Ring-Oscillator-Based, Vernier Time-to-Digital Converter Utilizing Carry Chains in FPGAs","sourcePdf":"tns-cui-2632168-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070712S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"7869242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7869242","articleId":"7755750","onlineDate":"23 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7755757,"authors":[{"name":"Sajid Javed","affiliation":["Virtual Reality Laboratory, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/8372808/7755757/javed-2632302-small.gif","p":["Sajid Javed received the B.Sc.

Traditional schemes model the background as a low rank matrix with corrupted entries. These schemes operate in batch mode and do not scale well with the data size. Moreover, without enforcing spatiotemporal information in the low-rank component, and because of occlusions by foreground objects and redundancy in video data, the design of a background initialization method robust against outliers is very challenging. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a spatiotemporal low-rank modeling method on dynamic video clips for estimating the robust background model. The proposed method encodes spatiotemporal constraints by regularizing spectral graphs. Initially, a motion-compensated binary matrix is generated using optical flow information to remove redundant data and to create a set of dynamic frames from the input video sequence. Then two graphs are constructed, one between frames for temporal consistency and the other between features for spatial consistency, to encode the local structure for continuously promoting the intrinsic behavior of the low-rank model against outliers. These two terms are then incorporated in the iterative Matrix Completion framework for improved segmentation of background. Rigorous evaluation on severely occluded and dynamic background sequences demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed method over state-of-the-art approaches.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/8372808/07755757.pdf","startPage":"1315","endPage":"1329","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2016.2632302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2016.2632302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8372808","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7755757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatiotemporal Low-Rank Modeling for Complex Scene Background Initialization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Heuristic algorithms","Dynamics","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Robustness","Solid modeling","Principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","graph theory","image motion analysis","image segmentation","image sequences","iterative methods","matrix algebra","object detection","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatiotemporal low-rank modeling","background modeling","computer-vision tasks","foreground objects","video data","outliers","low-rank modeling method","dynamic video clips","robust background model","optical flow information","input video sequence","dynamic background sequences","complex scene background initialization method","iterative matrix completion framework","spectral graphs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Background modeling","Matrix Completion (MC)","Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA)","spatiotemporal graph regularizations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755757/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Spatiotemporal Low-Rank Modeling for Complex Scene Background Initialization","volume":"28","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7755757/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17822392","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, South Korea, under the Information Technology Research Center","grantNumber":"IITP-2016-H8601-16-1002"},{"fundingName":"Institute for Information & Communications Technology Promotion"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatiotemporal Low-Rank Modeling for Complex Scene Background Initialization","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-jung-2632302-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.193213S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"8372808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"8372808","articleId":"7755757","onlineDate":"23 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7755758,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Feng Chou","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7776993/7755758/chou-2623781-small.gif","p":["Cheng-Feng Chou was born in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1990.

It is important to understand the challenges involved in GSEE for improving the quality and experience of educators and students. This paper reports the findings of an empirical study on the socio-cultural aspects of GSEE. A case study was conducted involving 14 participants from ten different universities in eight countries. The data was analyzed using grounded theory's open coding procedure. The key contributions of this paper are the identification and description of seven dimensions of socio-cultural distance that caused several significant challenges in the courses: 1) language differences; 2) concept of time; 3) attitude toward grades; 4) assumptions about national culture; 5) differences in autonomy; 6) influence of the course lecturer; and 7) work habits. Recommendations from this paper that are expected to benefit GSEE educators and students include: cross-cultural orientation of students prior to the course; use of various strategies to support better comprehension of different English accents (e.g., speaking slowly, replaying recorded video messages, and text chatting); and educators familiarizing themselves and their students with the relevant GSE and GSEE literature.","doi":"10.1109/TE.2016.2624742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TE.2016.2624742","startPage":"173","endPage":"182","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

A multirate optical transponder is enabled by only a single-encoder/decoder structure. The scheme is resilient to cycle-slip events due to its 90\u00b0 phase rotation invariant property. In addition, the performance of 4-D turbo TCM (TTCM) is investigated. The superior performance of TTCM over TCM is experimentally validated. Furthermore, the performance of 4-D TCM/TTCM is compared with standard PDM-mQAM formats combined with the soft-decision (SD) forward error correction (FEC) codes. It is shown that 4-D TCM concatenated with a low-complexity hard-decision FEC could be an interesting candidate for complexity-performance tradeoff with SD-FEC.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15, 15 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755767/","volume":"35","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7755767/","accessionNumber":"16669256","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"15 Jan.15, 2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Four-Dimensional Trellis Coded Modulation for Flexible Optical Communications","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001659","fundingName":"German Research Foundation","grantNumber":"GR 3774/2-2"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Four-Dimensional Trellis Coded Modulation for Flexible Optical Communications","sourcePdf":"jlt-alreesh-2632305-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061042S","chronDate":"Jan.15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7852551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7852551","articleId":"7755767","onlineDate":"23 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7755768,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7924296/7755768/wei-2632442-small.gif","p":["Qiang Wei received the B.Sc. degree from Henan University of Science\n and Technology, Luoyang, China, in 2008, and the M.A.Sc. degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an,\n China, in 2012, both in electrical engineering, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical\n engineering at Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada.","From 2012 to 2014, he was with the Delta Power Electronics, Nanjing, China, as an R&D Engineer.

Conventional SVM contains high-magnitude low-order harmonics, particularly the fifth and seventh harmonics, that are lying closely to the resonance frequency (4.5-5.5 p.u.) of the LC filter of the converter, thus, introducing resonance as the grid-side damping is small. Recently, a natural sampling SVM (NS-SVM) with superior low-order harmonics performance has been proposed for MV CSR. On this basis, a NS-SVM-based CMV reduction method is proposed for MV CSR in this paper. The proposed scheme achieves both good CMV reduction and superior low-order harmonics performance simultaneously. Additionally, effort to lower computational burden on calculating dwell times is made. Experiments are finally provided.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Support vector machines","Power harmonic filters","Resonant frequency","Rectifiers","Inductors","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rectifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural sampling SVM-based common-mode voltage reduction","medium-voltage current source rectifier","space vector modulation","LC filter","natural sampling SVM","grid-side damping","NS-SVM-based CMV reduction method","low-order harmonics performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Common-mode voltage (CMV)","current source rectifier (CSR)","low-order harmonics","medium voltage (MV)","natural sampling space vector modulation (SVM) (NS-SVM)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2016.2632442","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7924296/07755768.pdf","startPage":"7553","endPage":"7560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7924296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2016.2632442","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Natural Sampling SVM-Based Common-Mode Voltage Reduction in Medium-Voltage Current Source Rectifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7755768","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Natural Sampling SVM-Based Common-Mode Voltage Reduction in Medium-Voltage Current Source Rectifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755768/","volume":"32","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7755768/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16880364","dateOfInsertion":"10 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Natural Sampling SVM-Based Common-Mode Voltage Reduction in Medium-Voltage Current Source Rectifier","sourcePdf":"tpel-wei-2632442-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069311S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7924296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7924296","articleId":"7755768","onlineDate":"23 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7755770,"authors":[{"name":"Mario Christian Falconi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, Politecnico di Bari, Bari, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Mario Christian Falconi (S\u201914) was born in Italy, in 1989.

vertically stacked nanowire (VS-NW) memory device, which is based on the silicon-oxide-nitride-oxide-silicon (SONOS) configuration is characterized in two different operational modes, an inversion-mode and a junctionless-mode (JM). The LF noise showed 1/f -shape behavior regardless of the operational mode and followed the carrier number fluctuation model. With regard to the device-to-device variation and quality degradation of the LF noise after iterative program/erase operations, the five-story JM SONOS memory showed comparatively high immunity arising from its inherent bulk conduction and no-junction feature. Despite the harsh fabrication condition used to construct five-story VS-NW, even the five-story JM SONOS memory exhibited LF noise characteristics comparable to those of one-story JM SONOS memory. Thus, the five-story JM SONOS memory is attractive due to its high-performance capabilities and good scalability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755771/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","volume":"38","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"16581329","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2016","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7755771/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Low-Frequency Noise Characteristics in SONOS Flash Memory With Vertically Stacked Nanowire FETs","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Pioneer Research Center Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea within the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning","grantNumber":"2012-0009600"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Center for Integrated Smart Sensors within MSIP through the Global Frontier Project","grantNumber":"CISS-2011-0031848"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004358","fundingName":"Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd."},{"fundingName":"IDEC (EDA Tool, MPW)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Frequency Noise Characteristics in SONOS Flash Memory With Vertically Stacked Nanowire FETs","sourcePdf":"led-choi-2632182-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095523S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"7802592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7802592","articleId":"7755771","onlineDate":"23 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7755774,"authors":[{"name":"Noemi G.

Within the context of unit-commitment-based day-ahead energy and reserve electricity markets, this paper proposes a novel approach for network-constrained energy and reserve scheduling based on adjustable robust optimization (ARO). Unlike previously reported generation scheduling models using ARO, offers for up- and down-spinning reserves and on/off generation statuses are explicitly considered in the problem formulation to jointly cope with uncertain nodal net injections and system component outages in a multiperiod setting. Moreover, the feasibility of the deployment of awarded reserve offers across the network is guaranteed at minimum offer cost. In other words, in contrast to current industry practice relying on deterministic models, the optimal scheduling of energy and reserve offers ensures power balance for all possible uncertainty realizations and credible contingencies. The proposed model is formulated as an instance of mixed-integer trilevel programming. The robust counterpart is effectively solved by a modified column-and-constraint generation algorithm featuring two novel acceleration strategies that improve the overall computational performance. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its operational advantages over the conventional model relying on pre-specified reserve requirements.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388565","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2016.2632622","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/8388565/07755774.pdf","startPage":"3430","endPage":"3442","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2016.2632622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Least-Cost Reserve Offer Deliverability in Day-Ahead Generation Scheduling Under Wind Uncertainty and Generation and Network Outages","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","displayDocTitle":"Least-Cost Reserve Offer Deliverability in Day-Ahead Generation Scheduling Under Wind Uncertainty and Generation and Network Outages","volume":"9","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7755774/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"17857440","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755774/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003329","fundingName":"Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain","grantNumber":"ENE2015-63879-R and FPU13/03725"},{"fundingName":"Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha","grantNumber":"POII-2014-012-P"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003593","fundingName":"CNPq-Brazil"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Least-Cost Reserve Offer Deliverability in Day-Ahead Generation Scheduling Under Wind Uncertainty and Generation and Network Outages","sourcePdf":"tsg-arroyo-2632622-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136364S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8388565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8388565","articleId":"7755774","onlineDate":"23 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7755779,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed Hirzallah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7815452/7755779/hirza-2632598-small.gif","p":["Mohammed Hirzallah (S\u201915) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan, in 2011, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA, in 2015, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

This caught the interest of 4G/LTE providers, who wish to extend their LTE-A services to the unlicensed spectrum (LTE-U). In LTE-U, small-cell base stations aggregate unlicensed and licensed bands to increase the throughput. Wi-Fi/LTE-U coexistence is a challenging issue due to the different access mechanisms of these two systems, which may cause high collision rates and delays. By leveraging self-interference-suppression techniques, we propose joint mode/rate adaptation strategies for Wi-Fi/LTE-U coexistence. Specifically, a full-duplex enabled Wi-Fi station can transmit and receive data simultaneously to increase the throughput, or transmit and sense (TS mode) simultaneously to monitor the LTE-U activity. We model the LTE-U interference as a hidden Markov process, and solve the problem of jointly adapting Wi-Fi rates/modes using a framework of partially observable Markov decision process. A detection approach based on the sliding window correlator is analyzed for the TS mode, which can differentiate between Wi-Fi and LTE-U signals. Our results indicate that our scheme provides 1.5x (1.9x) average throughput gain for Wi-Fi system in the low (high) signal-to-interference-and-noise regime relative to a half-duplex-based scheme.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2016.2632598","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7815452/07755779.pdf","startPage":"20","endPage":"29","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2016.2632598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7815452","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full-Duplex-Based Rate/Mode Adaptation Strategies for Wi-Fi/LTE-U Coexistence: A POMDP Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7755779","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/49/7815452/7755779-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755779/","displayDocTitle":"Full-Duplex-Based Rate/Mode Adaptation Strategies for Wi-Fi/LTE-U Coexistence: A POMDP Approach","volume":"35","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16598344","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7755779/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"IIP-1535573, IIP-1265960 and CNS-1563655"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Full-Duplex-Based Rate/Mode Adaptation Strategies for Wi-Fi/LTE-U Coexistence: A POMDP Approach","sourcePdf":"jsac-hirzallah-2632598-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072739S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7815452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7815452","articleId":"7755779","onlineDate":"23 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7755782,"authors":[{"name":"Weike Feng","affiliation":["Air Force Engineering University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Weike","lastName":"Feng","orcid":"0000-0002-4205-538X","id":"37086200740"},{"name":"Yongshun Zhang","affiliation":["Air Force Engineering University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Yongshun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086199804"},{"name":"Xingyu He","affiliation":["Air Force Engineering University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Xingyu","lastName":"He","id":"37085841784"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-437X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1748"},{"format":"CD","value":"2379-9153"}],"articleNumber":"7755782","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":486},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Sensors Council","url":"http://www.ieee-sensors.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clutter","Estimation","MIMO","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","MIMO radar","Airborne radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","MIMO radar","radar clutter","space-time adaptive processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple input multiple output radar","RD STAP algorithm","reduce-dimension space-time adaptive processing MIMO radar","clutter rank estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clutter rank","MIMO","STAP","reduce-dimension"]}],"abstract":"Estimation of clutter rank in the reduce-dimension (RD) domain has great importance for RD space-time adaptive processing (STAP) algorithms.

Hence, computer-based systems providing quantitative wound assessment may be valuable for accurately monitoring wound healing status, with the wound area the best suited for automated analysis. Here, we present a novel approach, using support vector machines (SVM) to determine the wound boundaries on foot ulcer images captured with an image capture box, which provides controlled lighting and range. After superpixel segmentation, a cascaded two-stage classifier operates as follows: in the first stage, a set of k binary SVM classifiers are trained and applied to different subsets of the entire training images dataset, and incorrectly classified instances are collected. In the second stage, another binary SVM classifier is trained on the incorrectly classified set. We extracted various color and texture descriptors from superpixels that are used as input for each stage in the classifier training. Specifically, color and bag-of-word representations of local dense scale invariant feature transformation features are descriptors for ruling out irrelevant regions, and color and wavelet-based features are descriptors for distinguishing healthy tissue from wound regions. Finally, the detected wound boundary is refined by applying the conditional random field method. We have implemented the wound classification on a Nexus 5 smartphone platform, except for training which was done offline. Results are compared with other classifiers and show that our approach provides high global performance rates (average sensitivity = 73.3%, specificity = 94.6%) and is sufficiently efficient for a smartphone-based image analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2016.2632522","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/8013177/07755785.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2016.2632522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8013177","startPage":"2098","endPage":"2109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Area Determination of Diabetic Foot Ulcer Images Using a Cascaded Two-Stage SVM-Based Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7755785","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/10/8013177/7755785-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Area Determination of Diabetic Foot Ulcer Images Using a Cascaded Two-Stage SVM-Based Classification","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755785/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17135444","pubMedId":"27893380","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7755785/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"IIS-1065298"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Area Determination of Diabetic Foot Ulcer Images Using a Cascaded Two-Stage SVM-Based Classification","sourcePdf":"tbme-wang-2632522-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128113S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"8013177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8013177","articleId":"7755785","onlineDate":"23 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7755786,"authors":[{"name":"Ju Sun","affiliation":["Columbia University, New York, NY, USA","Mathematics Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ju Sun (S\u2019) is a postdoctoral scholar in the Mathematics Department at Stanford University.

Our algorithmic pipeline centers around solving a certain nonconvex optimization problem with a spherical constraint. In this paper, we provide a geometric characterization of the objective landscape. In particular, we show that the problem is highly structured with high probability: 1) there are no \u201cspurious\u201d local minimizers and 2) around all saddle points the objective has a negative directional curvature. This distinctive structure makes the problem amenable to efficient optimization algorithms. In a companion paper, we design a second-order trust-region algorithm over the sphere that provably converges to a local minimizer from arbitrary initializations, despite the presence of saddle points.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/18/7823065/7755794-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755794/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","volume":"63","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"16598401","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7755794/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Complete Dictionary Recovery Over the Sphere I: Overview and the Geometric Picture","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"ONR","grantNumber":"N00014-13-1-0492"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"1343282, CCF 1527809 and IIS 1546411"},{"fundingName":"Moore and Sloan Foundations"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Complete Dictionary Recovery Over the Sphere I: Overview and the Geometric Picture","sourcePdf":"tit-sun-2632162-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.234285S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7823065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"7823065","articleId":"7755794","onlineDate":"23 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7755797,"authors":[{"name":"Zhouhua Peng","affiliation":["School of Marine Engineering, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China","Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/7900484/7755797/peng-2632304-small.gif","p":["Zhouhua Peng (M\u201913) received the B.E. degree in electrical\n engineering and automation, the M.E. degree in power electronics and power drives, and the Ph.D. degree in control\n theory and control engineering from Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China, in 2005, 2008, and 2011, respectively.\n","He is an Associate Professor in the School of Marine Engineering, Dalian Maritime University, China.

The first one is to force the marine vehicles to follow a convex hull spanned by multiple parameterized paths. The second one is to meet the requirement of a desired dynamic behavior along multiple paths during containment. A modular design approach to the containment maneuvering of marine surface vehicles is presented. At first, an estimator module using a recurrent neural network is proposed to estimate the unknown kinetics induced by model uncertainty, unmodeled dynamics, and environmental disturbances. Next, a controller module is developed based on a distributed path maneuvering design and a linear tracking differentiator. Finally, two path update laws based on a maneuvering error feedback and a filtering update scheme, respectively, are constructed. The estimator-controller pair forms a cascade system, which is proved to be input-to-state stable. The developed controller has a desirable spatial-temporal decoupling property, and geometric and dynamic objectives can be achieved separately. Results of comparative studies are provided to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2016.2632304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7900484","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2016.2632304","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/3516/7900484/07755797.pdf","startPage":"1026","endPage":"1036","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Containment Maneuvering of Marine Surface Vehicles With Multiple Parameterized Paths via Spatial-Temporal Decoupling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Containment Maneuvering of Marine Surface Vehicles With Multiple Parameterized Paths via Spatial-Temporal Decoupling","volume":"22","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7755797/","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16808488","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755797/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China","grantNumber":"14207614"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61273307, 61673330, 51579023, 61673081 and 61273137"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"3132016313 and 3132016201"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2015M570247 and XJ2015009"},{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFC0301500"},{"fundingName":"High Level Talent Innovation and Entrepreneurship Program of Dalian","grantNumber":"2016RQ036"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Containment Maneuvering of Marine Surface Vehicles With Multiple Parameterized Paths via Spatial-Temporal Decoupling","sourcePdf":"tmech-wang-2632304-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097517S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"7900484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"7900484","articleId":"7755797","onlineDate":"23 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7755799,"authors":[{"name":"Yoonchang Han","affiliation":["Music and Audio Research Group, Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570655/7756694/7755799/han-2632307-small.gif","p":["Yoonchang Han was born in Seoul, South Korea, in 1986.

It enables music search by instrument, helps recognize musical genres, or can make music transcription easier and more accurate. In this paper, we present a convolutional neural network framework for predominant instrument recognition in real-world polyphonic music. We train our network from fixed-length music excerpts with a single-labeled predominant instrument and estimate an arbitrary number of predominant instruments from an audio signal with a variable length. To obtain the audio-excerpt-wise result, we aggregate multiple outputs from sliding windows over the test audio. In doing so, we investigated two different aggregation methods: one takes the class-wise average followed by normalization, and the other perform temporally local class-wise max-pooling on the output probability prior to averaging and normalization steps to minimize the effect of averaging process suppresses the activation of sporadically appearing instruments. In addition, we conducted extensive experiments on several important factors that affect the performance, including analysis window size, identification threshold, and activation functions for neural networks to find the optimal set of parameters. Our analysis on the instrument-wise performance found that the onset type is a critical factor for recall and precision of each instrument. Using a dataset of 10k audio excerpts from 11 instruments for evaluation, we found that convolutional neural networks are more robust than conventional methods that exploit spectral features and source separation with support vector machines. Experimental results showed that the proposed convolutional network architecture obtained an F1 measure of 0.619 for micro and 0.513 for macro, respectively, achieving 23.1% and 18.8% in performance improvement compared with the state-of-the-art algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2016.2632307","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language

The conventional factor graph representation for the system involves observation factors, which are functions of a number of variables in the form of multiplication and summation.

It turns out that our approach is much more efficient than the existing approaches, leading to remarkable performance improvement as shown by simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2016.2632180","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/7784861/07755802.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2016.2632180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7784861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Auxiliary Variable-Aided Hybrid Message Passing Approach to Joint Channel Estimation and Decoding for MIMO-OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7755802","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755802/","displayDocTitle":"An Auxiliary Variable-Aided Hybrid Message Passing Approach to Joint Channel Estimation and Decoding for MIMO-OFDM","volume":"24","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16561131","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7755802/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"NSFC 61571402, NSFC 61201251 and NSFC U1204607"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council's DECRA","grantNumber":"DE120101266"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Auxiliary Variable-Aided Hybrid Message Passing Approach to Joint Channel Estimation and Decoding for MIMO-OFDM","sourcePdf":"lsp-wang-2632180-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062669S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"7784861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7784861","articleId":"7755802","onlineDate":"23 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7755804,"authors":[{"name":"Qiangsong Zhao","affiliation":["College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7874245/7755804/zhao-2631516-small.gif","p":["Qiangsong Zhao was born in Kaifeng, China.

However, limited by digital sampling, conventional RC with integer phase lead compensation cannot exactly compensate the system phase lag, which may result in instability in the case of low sampling frequency. In this paper, a fractional phase lead compensation RC (FPLC-RC) scheme is proposed to enable the phase lead step to be fractional, which can enlarge the stability region and improve the tracking accuracy. A newly devised finite-impulse response fractional lead filter based on Lagrange interpolation is applied to approximate the fractional lead items.

Typical backscatter tags and computational radio frequency (RF) identification systems are unnecessarily limited to modulating data with \u201cON-OFF\u201d switching front-ends, which leads to extensive spectrum occupancy, due to the rectangular pulses. This paper sets the foundations to overcome these limitations and proposes designs of RF front-ends that are capable of varying the tag reflection coefficient in a continuous way over time. Arbitrary waveforms can be generated to perform pulse shaping on the backscattered signals, which require significantly reduced BW. The principles presented in this paper will enable sophisticated tags to perform complex modulation schemes under BW constraints, while maintaining a very low RF front-end complexity, using a single nonlinear component such as a p-i-n diode or field-effect transistor. Migrating the idea of pulse shaping from complex power-demanding active radios to such minimal RF front-ends will complete backscatter radio as a communication scheme for simple RF tags and sensors in large-scale deployments. Each tag becomes a miniature software-defined radio that implements diverse communication schemes with increased spectral efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2016.2623703","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7776993/07755817.pdf","startPage":"4774","endPage":"4788","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2016.2623703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7776993","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pulse Shaping: The Missing Piece of Backscatter Radio and RFID","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755817/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Pulse Shaping: The Missing Piece of Backscatter Radio and RFID","volume":"64","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16519027","htmlLink":"/document/7755817/","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation-EFRI"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000774","fundingName":"Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pulse Shaping: The Missing Piece of Backscatter Radio and RFID","sourcePdf":"tmtt-kimionis-2623703-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07026S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7776993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7776993","articleId":"7755817","onlineDate":"23 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7755818,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel C.

The proposed architecture excels the state of the art in terms of simplicity and flexibility. While its short critical path leverages the use of equivalent polyphase decomposition techniques to increase the global system's sampling frequency, the capability of changing the system's frequency response in real time enables its use in both single- and dual-band transmission scenarios. To mitigate a crosstalk in the dual-band scenario, a precompensation technique is also proposed. This novel concept has been successfully validated in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) based transmitter. To validate both the proposed transmitter as well as the precompensation mechanism, spectrum and error-vector magnitude (EVM) measurements were obtained for two scenarios with a carrier frequency of 2.5 GHz: 1) single-band, using quadrature phase-shifting keying (QPSK), 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and 64-QAM, with no intermediate frequency (IF), for different symbol rate (SR) values (from 3.125 up to 15.625 Msps) and 2) single- and dual-band, using QPSK and 16-QAM, with an SR of 3.125 Msps, for different IF values (from 2 up to 120 MHz). All the experimental results present EVM values below 2.6%, resulting in a well-defined constellation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Agile Single- and Dual-Band All-Digital Transmitter Based on a Precompensated Tunable Delta\u2013Sigma Modulator","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2016.2622696","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7776993/07755818.pdf","startPage":"4720","endPage":"4730","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2016.2622696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7776993","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7755818","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755818/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Agile Single- and Dual-Band All-Digital Transmitter Based on a Precompensated Tunable Delta\u2013Sigma Modulator","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7755818/","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2016","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16519038","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001871","fundingName":"National Funds through FCT-Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia","grantNumber":"PEst-OE/EEI/LA0008/2013, UID/EEA/50008/2013, EXCL/EEI-TEL/0067/2012 (CREaTION), PD/BD/105857/2014, SFRH/BD/91533/2012 and SFRH/BD/90103/2012"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Agile Single- and Dual-Band All-Digital Transmitter Based on a Precompensated Tunable Delta\u2013Sigma Modulator","sourcePdf":"tmtt-dinis-2622696-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080448S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7776993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7776993","articleId":"7755818","onlineDate":"23 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7755824,"authors":[{"name":"Ateeq Ur Rehman","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7755824/rehma-2632098-small.gif","p":["Ateeq Ur Rehman received the B.Eng. degree in computer science and information technology from the Islamic University of Technology (OIC), Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 2009.

In this paper, we propose a cognitive Go-Back-N Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (CGBN-HARQ) scheme that enables the cognitive user (CU) to opportunistically transmit data over a primary radio (PR) channel. Based on the sensing decisions by the CU, it decides about the availability of the PU's channel for its own transmission using the proposed CGBN-HARQ scheme. In addition, it enables the CR transmitter to receive feedback concerning the success/failure of its prior transmissions during the sensing and transmission phases of the time-slot (TS). A discrete time Markov chain model is invoked for the theoretical analysis of the proposed system, where we conceive an algorithm to generate all possible states of the CR transmitter. Both the throughput and delay of the CGBN-HARQ scheme is analyzed by deriving a range of closed-form formulas, which are validated by simulation results. The occupation of the channel by the PU and the reliability of the CU's channel significantly affect both the achievable throughput and the delay of the CGBN-HARQ scheme. Finally, our studies show that the number of packets transmitted within a TS should be adapted according to the communication channel for attaining the maximum throughput and the lowest average transmission delay.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput and Delay Analysis of Cognitive Go-Back-N Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest Using Discrete-Time Markov Modelling","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2632098","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07755824.pdf","startPage":"9659","endPage":"9680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2632098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7755824","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755824/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","displayDocTitle":"Throughput and Delay Analysis of Cognitive Go-Back-N Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest Using Discrete-Time Markov Modelling","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7755824/","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16606980","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/Noo4558/1 and EP/L018659/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council\u2019s Advanced Fellow Grant under the Beam-Me-Up Project"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000288","fundingName":"Royal Society\u2019s Wolfson Research Merit Award"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004684","fundingName":"Abdul Wali Khan University Mardan, Pakistan, under the Faculty Development Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Throughput and Delay Analysis of Cognitive Go-Back-N Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest Using Discrete-Time Markov Modelling","sourcePdf":"access-hanzo-2632098-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.228648S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7419931","articleId":"7755824","onlineDate":"23 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7755826,"authors":[{"name":"Saeed Peyghami","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7924296/7755826/peygh-2632441-small.gif","p":["Saeed Peyghami (S\u201914) was born in Tabriz, Iran, in 1988.

Like the frequency-droop method, a voltage-based droop approach has been employed to control the converters in low voltage direct current (LVDC) MGs. However, voltage variation due to the droop gains and line resistances causes poor power sharing and voltage regulation in dc MG, which in most cases are solved by a secondary controller by using a communication network. To avoid such an infrastructure and its accompanied complications, this paper proposes a new droop scheme to control dc sources by introducing a small ac voltage superimposed onto the output dc voltage of converters. Therefore, dc sources can be coordinated together with the frequency of the ac voltage, without any communication network like synchronous generators (SGs) in conventional power systems. Small signal stability analysis, as well as mathematical calculations, is presented to demonstrate the analogy between the proposed strategy and frequency-based droop approach of the SGs. The effectiveness of the proposed control system is evaluated by simulations and verified by experiments.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7924296/07755826.pdf","startPage":"8089","endPage":"8099","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2016.2632441","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2016.2632441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7924296","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7755826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronverter-Enabled DC Power Sharing Approach for LVDC Microgrids","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Frequency conversion","Microgrids","Power system stability","Communication networks","Reliability","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","power generation control","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronverter-enabled DC power sharing approach","LVDC microgrids","AC microgrid","coordinating active power sharing","droop-controlled sources","frequency-droop method","voltage-based droop approach","low-voltage direct current MG","voltage variation","droop gains","line resistances","voltage regulation","dc MG","secondary controller","communication network","small-AC voltage","output DC voltage","small-signal stability analysis","mathematical calculations","frequency-based droop approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC microgrid (MG)","droop method","power sharing","synchronverter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Synchronverter-Enabled DC Power Sharing Approach for LVDC Microgrids","volume":"32","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7755826/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"16880328","dateOfInsertion":"10 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronverter-Enabled DC Power Sharing Approach for LVDC Microgrids","sourcePdf":"tpel-peyghami-2632441-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.176937S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7924296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"7924296","articleId":"7755826","onlineDate":"23 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7755831,"authors":[{"name":"Xianglan Jin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea"],"bio":{"p":["Xianglan Jin (M\u201912) received her B.S. and M.S. degrees in telecommunications engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and her Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from Seoul National University, Korea, in 2008.

Unfortunately, the analysis of EDA signals is made difficult by the superposition of numerous components that can obscure the signal information related to a user's response to a stimulus. We show how simple preprocessing followed by a novel compressed sensing based decomposition can mitigate the effects of the undesired noise components and help reveal the underlying physiological signal. The proposed framework allows for decomposition of EDA signals with provable bounds on the recovery of user responses. We test our procedure on both synthetic and real-world EDA signals from wearable sensors and demonstrate that our approach allows for more accurate recovery of user responses as compared with the existing techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2016.2632523","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/8013177/07755834.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2016.2632523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8013177","startPage":"2142","endPage":"2151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Compressed Sensing Based Decomposition of Electrodermal Activity Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7755834","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Compressed Sensing Based Decomposition of Electrodermal Activity Signals","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755834/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17135461","pubMedId":"27893381","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7755834/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Compressed Sensing Based Decomposition of Electrodermal Activity Signals","sourcePdf":"tbme-jain-2632523-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074099S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"8013177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8013177","articleId":"7755834","onlineDate":"23 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7755836,"authors":[{"name":"Diksha Golait","affiliation":["IIT Indore, Indore, India","R&D, Microsoft India, City-Hyderabad, Telangana, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/7782442/7755836/golai-2632071-small.gif","p":["Diksha Golait was born in Bhopal, India.

SIP being a text-based protocol is vulnerable to a range of denial of service (DoS) attacks. These DoS attacks can render the SIP servers/SIP proxy servers unusable by depleting memory and CPU time. In this paper, we consider two types of DoS attacks, namely, flooding attacks and coordinated attacks for detection. Flooding attacks affect both stateless and stateful SIP servers while coordinated attacks affect stateful SIP servers. We model the SIP operation as discrete event system (DES) and design a new state transition machine, which we name as probabilistic counting deterministic timed automata (PCDTA) to describe the behavior of SIP operations. We also identify different types of anomalies that can occur in a DES model, which appear in the form of illegal transitions, violating timing constraints, and appear in number which is otherwise not seen. Subsequently, we map various DoS attacks in SIP to a type of anomaly in DES. PCDTA can learn probabilities of various transitions and timings delay from a set of nonmalicious training sequences. A trained PCDTA can detect anomalies, and hence various DoS attacks in SIP. We perform a thorough experiment with computer simulated SIP traffic and report the detection performance of PCDTA on various attacks generated through custom scripts.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2016.2632071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7782442","startPage":"730","endPage":"745","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7782442/07755836.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting Anomalous Behavior in VoIP Systems: A Discrete Event System Modeling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7755836/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Detecting Anomalous Behavior in VoIP Systems: A Discrete Event System Modeling","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16596033","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting Anomalous Behavior in VoIP Systems: A Discrete Event System Modeling","sourcePdf":"tifs-hubballi-2632071-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102012S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7782442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7782442","articleId":"7755836","onlineDate":"23 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7755839,"authors":[{"name":"Boris Bellalta","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Technologies, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Boris","lastName":"Bellalta","orcid":"0000-0002-7826-3703","id":"37330390400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7755839","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1031},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless LAN","Throughput","Computational modeling","IEEE 802.11 Standard","Analytical models","Markov processes","Nickel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["throughput analysis","high-density WLAN","inter-wireless local area network interaction","inter-WLAN interaction","continuous time Markov chain model","CTMC model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IEEE 802.11","WLANs","CSMA/CA","dense networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7755839","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7874222/07755839.pdf","startPage":"592","endPage":"595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2632109","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2632109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7874222","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput Analysis in High Density WLANs","abstract":"This letter proposes a simple but accurate approximation to analytically model both the inter-wireless local area networks (WLANs) interactions and the negative effect of collisions in the performance of high density WLAN scenarios.

R, G, B, and IR micro-LED arrays with a pixel pitch of 1 mm were demonstrated. Sequential row scanning and multiple columns programming is performed by two CMOS-based application specific integrated circuit chips providing constant-sinking current and forward voltage for each pixel of the micro-LED arrays. The uniformity of operating current and forward voltage of the micro-LED pixels was measured with 1.94% coefficient of variation. The micro-LED pixel has much shorter rising time and higher response frequency than those of regular packaged blue and white LEDs. The implemented R-G-B micro-LED arrays are the excellent candidate for high-definition fine-pitch LED displays and demonstrated its versatile functionalities such as visible light communications.

Recent research has explored the mimicking of this capability in hardware with the aim to make electronic circuits autonomous with self-detection and repair. The provision of hardware architectures and interconnectivity between the massive numbers of spiking neurons and astrocytes is a significant research challenge, as the neuron and astrocyte networks have different communication patterns. In particular they have large volumes of information exchanges. This paper presents a novel interconnected architecture for ANN hardware systems based on the hierarchical astrocyte network architecture (HANA). HANA supports the information exchanges between astrocyte cells and addresses the interconnection challenge by providing a novel hierarchical networks-on-chip (NoC) structure of neurons and astrocytes cells. The proposed HANA incorporates a priority scheduling mechanism to increase the information exchange rate for global astrocyte cells, thus reducing the global communication latency and providing a balance between the local and global astrocyte network traffic. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HANA architecture can provide efficient information exchange rates for ANN, while the hardware synthesis results demonstrates that it has a low area utilization and power consumption which supports scalability.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2016.2615051","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7755810/07755855.pdf","startPage":"2290","endPage":"2303","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2016.2615051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7755810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable Networks-on-Chip Interconnected Architecture for Astrocyte-Neuron Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7755855","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755855/","displayDocTitle":"Scalable Networks-on-Chip Interconnected Architecture for Astrocyte-Neuron Networks","volume":"63","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16486562","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7755855/","dateOfInsertion":"23 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable Networks-on-Chip Interconnected Architecture for Astrocyte-Neuron Networks","sourcePdf":"tcsi-liu-2615051-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168912S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7755810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7755810","articleId":"7755855","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7755884,"authors":[{"name":"Abhronil Sengupta","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7755810/7755884/sengu-2615312-small.gif","p":["Abhronil Sengupta (S\u201915) received the B.E. degree from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India, in 2013.

In this paper, we propose a novel, equalization-based soft-output data-detection algorithm and corresponding reference FPGA designs for wideband massive MU-MIMO systems that use orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). Our data-detection algorithm performs approximate minimum mean-square error (MMSE) or box-constrained equalization using coordinate descent. We deploy a variety of algorithm-level optimizations that enable near-optimal error-rate performance at low implementation complexity, even for systems with hundreds of base-station (BS) antennas and thousands of subcarriers. We design a parallel VLSI architecture that uses pipeline interleaving and can be parametrized at design time to support various antenna configurations. We develop reference FPGA designs for massive MU-MIMO-OFDM systems and provide an extensive comparison to existing designs in terms of implementation complexity, throughput, and error-rate performance. For a 128 BS antenna, 8-user massive MU-MIMO-OFDM system, our FPGA design outperforms the next-best implementation by more than $2.6 \\times $ in terms of throughput per FPGA look-up tables.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2016.2611645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7755810","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2016.2611645","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7755810/07755889.pdf","startPage":"2357","endPage":"2367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Throughput Data Detection for Massive MU-MIMO-OFDM Using Coordinate Descent","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/8919/7755810/7755889-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2016","displayDocTitle":"High-Throughput Data Detection for Massive MU-MIMO-OFDM Using Coordinate Descent","volume":"63","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7755889/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16486561","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7755889/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Xilinx Inc."},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)","grantNumber":"ECCS-1408370, CNS-1265332 and ECCS-1232274"},{"fundingName":"Xilinx Inc."},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. NSF","grantNumber":"ECCS-1408006 and CCF-1535897"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"High-Throughput Data Detection for Massive MU-MIMO-OFDM Using Coordinate Descent","sourcePdf":"tcsi-studer-2611645-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120164S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7755810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"7755810","articleId":"7755889","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7755945,"authors":[{"name":"Xue-Zhong Wang","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200433, P.R.C. 14130180001@fudan.edu.cn"],"firstName":"Xue-Zhong","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Yimin Wei","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Sciences and Key Laboratory of Mathematics for Nonlinear Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200433, P.R.C. ymwei@fudan.edu.cn"],"firstName":"Yimin","lastName":"Wei"},{"name":"Predrag S.

It is constructed based on a comprehensive geological information. A comprehensive numerical reservoir model has tens of millions of grid blocks. Therefore, it becomes computationally expensive and time consuming to run the model for different reservoir simulation scenarios. There are many efforts have been made to reduce the computational size using the proxy models. Proxy models are the substitute to the complex numerical simulation by producing a meaningful representation of the complex system in a very short time. The conventional proxy models are either statistical or mathematical approaches. These conventional approaches are still limited to the complexity of the reservoir and the number of the numerical simulation runs needed to build the proxy model. In this study, a smart proxy model that is based on artificial intelligence and data mining is presented. A grid based smart proxy model is developed to reproduce the dynamic reservoir properties of a full- field numerical simulation in few seconds. A comprehensive spatio-temporal database is built using the conducted numerical simulation run. The data from the database is trained, calibrated, and verified throughout the development of the smart proxy model. Smart proxy model is able to produce pressure and saturation at each reservoir grid block accurately and with a significantly less computational time compared to the numerical reservoir simulation model.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7756055","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/KACSTIT.2016.7756063","publicationTitle":"2016 4th Saudi International Conference on Information Technology (Big Data Analysis) (KACSTIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 4th Saudi International Conference on Information Technology (Big Data Analysis) (KACSTIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7751139/7756055/07756063.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/KACSTIT.2016.7756063","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A data-driven smart proxy model for a comprehensive reservoir simulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A data-driven smart proxy model for a comprehensive reservoir simulation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7756063/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16506327","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7756063/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A data-driven smart proxy model for a comprehensive reservoir simulation","confLoc":"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","sourcePdf":"008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055093S","chronDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7751139","isNumber":"7756055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7751139","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7756055","articleId":"7756063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7756134,"authors":[{"name":"Mingming Liu","affiliation":["State Key Lab for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, China PR"],"firstName":"Mingming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086201165"},{"name":"Yanwen Guo","affiliation":["State Key Lab for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, China PR"],"firstName":"Yanwen","lastName":"Guo","id":"37291112900"},{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China PR"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085357692"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2303-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2304-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7756134","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7756134","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Solid modeling","Cameras","Semantics","Image segmentation","Databases","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","graph theory","human computer interaction","image matching","image retrieval","indoor environment","interactive systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["normal guided data-driven semantic modeling","indoor image","interactive approach","indoor environment semantic modeling","depth estimation","scene geometry","normal-based graph","graph matching","sparse surface orientations","user interaction","image retrieval"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Indoor image modeling","orientation estimation","calibration"]}],"abstract":"We present in this paper an interactive approach for semantically modeling indoor environments given only a single indoor image as input, without requiring access to the scene or using any additional measurements like the RGBD cameras. Our key insight is that, although depth estimation from a single image is notoriously difficult, we can conveniently obtain a relatively accurate normal map, which essentially conveys a great deal of scene geometry. This enables us to model each object in a data-driven manner by representing the object as a normal-based graph and retrieving a similar model from the database by graph matching. We hypothesize a set of sparse surface orientations for the image, and further refine them in an intuitive and straightforward manner. With a small amount of simple user interaction, our approach is able to generate a plausible model of the scene. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we show the modeling results on a variety of indoor images.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7756110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CW.2016.23","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Cyberworlds (CW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Cyberworlds (CW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7746705/7756110/07756134.pdf","startPage":"111","endPage":"118","doi":"10.1109/CW.2016.23","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Normal Guided Data-Driven Semantic Modeling from a Single Indoor Image","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Normal Guided Data-Driven Semantic Modeling from a Single Indoor Image","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7756134/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16581009","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7756134/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Normal Guided Data-Driven Semantic Modeling from a Single Indoor Image","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"2303a111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092885S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7746705","isNumber":"7756110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7746705","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7756110","articleId":"7756134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7756144,"authors":[{"name":"Zhu Deli","affiliation":["College of Engineer China Agriculture University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":"Deli","id":"37086207405"},{"name":"Chen Bingqi","affiliation":["College of Engineer China Agriculture University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Bingqi","id":"37847589200"},{"name":"Yang Yunong","affiliation":["College of Engineer China Agriculture University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Yunong","id":"37086203927"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2303-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2304-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7756144","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":434},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7756144","abstract":"This paper proposed a farmland scene classification method based on CNN (Convolutional neural network).

The conventional memory system greatly impacts the system efficiency and can't be improved anymore because of the fabrication process. Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM) provides many benefits, such as non-volatility, low leakage, high-speed operation and unlimited endurance. Because of these attractive features, MRAM is regarded as one of the most promising technologies to incorporate into the memory hierarchy. Since the manufacturing cost of real MRAM device is high, the simulation tool is rather important. In this paper, We design and evaluate a trace-driven simulator for MRAM, called MRAMsim. We have proposed various Address Mapping Schemes to improve the efficiency of MRAM memory system. We show that MRAM is a promising candidate for main memory system. The experimental results reveal that MRAM-based main memory system is able to achieve fast response time and high bandwidth.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonvolatile memory","Magnetic tunneling","Memory management","Magnetoresistance","System-on-chip","Phase change random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetoresistive devices","MRAM devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MRAMsim","magnetoresistive RAM simulator","system efficiency","fabrication process","magnetoresistive random access memory","nonvolatility low leakage high-speed operation","MRAM device","simulation tool","trace-driven simulator","address mapping","MRAM-based main memory system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MRAM","simulator","main memory","address mapping","non-volatility"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7756215","doi":"10.1109/ICDCSW.2016.12","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 36th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7756174/7756178/07756215.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCSW.2016.12","startPage":"90","endPage":"97","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7756178","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 36th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MRAMsim: A Simulator for Magnetoresistive RAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MRAMsim: A Simulator for Magnetoresistive RAM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7756215/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2016","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7756215/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16499312","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MRAMsim: A Simulator for Magnetoresistive RAM","confLoc":"Nara, Japan","sourcePdf":"5878a090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049316S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7756174","isNumber":"7756178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7756174","xplore-issue":"7756178","articleId":"7756215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7756224,"authors":[{"name":"Dominik Sch\u00e4fer","affiliation":["University of Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany"],"firstName":"Dominik","lastName":"Sch\u00e4fer","id":"37061343400"},{"name":"Janick Edinger","affiliation":["University of Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany"],"firstName":"Janick","lastName":"Edinger","id":"37085848362"},{"name":"Sebastian VanSyckel","affiliation":["University of Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"VanSyckel","id":"37061233400"},{"name":"Justin Mazzola Paluska","affiliation":["University of Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany"],"firstName":"Justin Mazzola","lastName":"Paluska","id":"37394365700"},{"name":"Christian Becker","affiliation":["MIT, CSAIL, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Becker","id":"37270620000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3686-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3687-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5666"}],"articleNumber":"7756224","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":486},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tasklets: Overcoming Heterogeneity in Distributed Computing Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Cloud computing","Grid computing","Computer architecture","Operating systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grid computing","Internet","middleware","resource allocation","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed computing systems","remote computing","Internet","distributed environment","computation-intense applications","edge computing","tasklet system","fine-grained computation units","middleware","virtualization","host language concept"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed Computing","Edge-centric Computing","Heterogeneity","Resource Sharing","Grid Computing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7756224","abstract":"Distributed computing is a good alternative to expensive supercomputers. There are plenty of frameworks that enable programmers to harvest remote computing power. However, until today, much computation power in the edges of the Internet remains unused. While idle devices could contribute to a distributed environment as generic computation resources, computation-intense applications could use this pool of resources to enhance their execution quality. In this paper, we identify heterogeneity as a major burden for distributed and edge computing. Heterogeneity is present in multiple forms. We draw our vision of a comprehensive distributed computing system and show where existing frameworks fall short in dealing with the heterogeneity of distributed computing. Afterwards, we present the Tasklet system, our approach for a distributed computing framework. Tasklets are fine-grained computation units that can be issued for remote and local execution. We tackle the different dimensions of heterogeneity and show how to make use of available computation power in edge resources. In our prototype, we use middleware and virtualization technologies as well as a host language concept.","doi":"10.1109/ICDCSW.2016.22","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 36th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7756174/7756178/07756224.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCSW.2016.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7756178","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 36th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW)","startPage":"156","endPage":"161","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2016","displayDocTitle":"Tasklets: Overcoming Heterogeneity in Distributed Computing Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7756224/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16499329","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7756224/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tasklets: Overcoming Heterogeneity in Distributed Computing Systems","confLoc":"Nara, Japan","sourcePdf":"5878a156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041885S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7756174","isNumber":"7756178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7756174","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7756178","articleId":"7756224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":7756226,"authors":[{"name":"Kenji Saito","affiliation":["Sumitomo Bldg., Orb, Inc., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenji","lastName":"Saito","id":"37086204799"},{"name":"Hiroyuki Yamada","affiliation":["Sumitomo Bldg., Orb, Inc., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Yamada","id":"37086210860"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3686-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3687-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5666"}],"articleNumber":"7756226","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1946},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7756226","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probabilistic logic","Online banking","Protocols","Data structures","History","Servers","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","electronic money","finite state machines","network servers","peer-to-peer computing","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Blockchain","probabilistic state machine","distributed timestamp server technology","Bitcoin realization","digital cash system","legal applications","financial applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["blockchain","consensus","state machine","transaction","agreement","fault tolerance","Byzantine","BFT"]}],"abstract":"Blockchain is a distributed timestamp server technology introduced for realization of Bitcoin, a digital cash system.

However, conventional AdaBoost.RT algorithms suffer from the limitation that the threshold value must be manually specified rather than chosen through a self-adaptive mechanism, which cannot guarantee a result in an optimal model for general cases. In this paper, we present a generic AdaBoost framework with robust threshold mechanism and structural optimization on regression problems. The error statistics of each weak learner on one given problem dataset is utilized to automate the choice of the optimal cut-off threshold value. In addition, a special single-layer neural network is employed to provide a second opportunity to further adjust the structure and strength the adaption capability of the AdaBoost regression model. Moreover, to consolidate the theoretical foundation of AdaBoost algorithms, we are the first to conduct a rigorous and comprehensive theoretical analysis on the proposed approach. We prove that the general bound on the empirical error with a fraction of training examples is always within a limited soft margin, which indicates that our novel algorithm can avoid over-fitting. We further analyze the bounds on the generalization error directly under probably approximately correct learning. The extensive experimental verifications on the UCI benchmarks have demonstrated that the performance of the proposed method is superior to other state-of-the-art ensemble and single learning algorithms. Furthermore, a real-world indoor positioning application has also revealed that the proposed method has higher positioning accuracy and faster speed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Optimization","Training","Neural networks","Machine learning algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Approximation algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","optimisation","pattern classification","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["structural optimization","AdaBoost algorithm","popular ensemble method","weak learner","generalization performance","conventional AdaBoost.RT algorithms","threshold value","self-adaptive mechanism","optimal model","generic AdaBoost framework","robust threshold mechanism","regression problems","error statistics","given problem dataset","optimal cut-off","special single-layer neural network","AdaBoost regression model","rigorous analysis","comprehensive theoretical analysis","empirical error","generalization error","single learning algorithms","AdaBoost framework","adaption capability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AdaBoost algorithm","bounds of empirical error and generalization error","ensemble method","indoor positioning system","robust threshold","special single-layer neural network","structural optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2016.2623900","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/8207702/07756295.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"76","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8207702","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2016.2623900","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel AdaBoost Framework With Robust Threshold and Structural Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7756295","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel AdaBoost Framework With Robust Threshold and Structural Optimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7756295/","volume":"48","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7756295/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17447047","pubMedId":"27898387","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004733","fundingName":"University of Macau","grantNumber":"MYRG2015-00077-FST and MYRG2016-00160-FST"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel AdaBoost Framework With Robust Threshold and Structural Optimization","sourcePdf":"tcyb-yang-2623900-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091303S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"8207702","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8207702","articleId":"7756295","onlineDate":"24 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7756297,"authors":[{"name":"Arif Mahmood","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/7872536/7756297/mahmo-2632716-small.gif","p":["Arif Mahmood received the master's degree and the PhD degree in\n computer science from the Lahore University of Management Sciences, in 2003 and 2011, respectively, with distinction.\n Currently, he is a postdoc researcher in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Qatar University.

To enable data mining techniques to solve problems in the network domain, the nodes need to be mapped to a geometric space. We propose this mapping by representing each network node with its geodesic distances from all other nodes. The space spanned by the geodesic distance vectors is the geodesic space of that network. The position of different nodes in the geodesic space encode the network structure. In this space, considering a continuous density field induced by each node, density at a specific point is the summation of density fields induced by all nodes. We drift each node in the direction of positive density gradient using an iterative algorithm till each node reaches a local maximum. Due to the network structure captured by this space, the nodes that drift to the same region of space belong to the same communities in the original network. We use the direction of movement and final position of each node as important clues for community membership assignment. The proposed algorithm is compared with more than 10 state-of-the-art community detection techniques on two benchmark networks with known communities using Normalized Mutual Information criterion. The proposed algorithm outperformed these methods by a significant margin.

However, a major obstacle in the industrial implementation of such turbo-machinery is the lack of bearing technologies suited for high rotational speeds. Promising bearing candidates for long lifetime at high rotational speeds are contactless bearing types, such as gas bearings or active magnetic bearings. Gas bearings allow for compact system integration with high load capacity and stiffness; but their application at high rotational speeds is limited by their poor dynamic stability. Active magnetic bearings facilitate a precise control of the rotor dynamics; however, at the price of a substantially increased installation and system complexity. Aiming to combine the advantages of these two bearing technologies, a hybrid bearing approach is proposed using a self-acting gas bearing for providing the main load capacity in combination with a small-sized active magnetic damper to achieve stable operation at high operational speeds. In order not to impair the compactness of the resulting drive system, dedicated displacement sensors are avoided by employing an eddy-current-based self-sensing rotor displacement measurement method using high-frequency signal injection. A previously proposed eddy-current-based self-sensing method is refined and implemented; measurement results are presented for a prototype machine proving the feasibility of the proposed hybrid bearing approach.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7874245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2016.2632680","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7874245/07756302.pdf","startPage":"2982","endPage":"2991","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2016.2632680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active Magnetic Damper for Ultrahigh-Speed Permanent-Magnet Machines With Gas Bearings","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","displayDocTitle":"Active Magnetic Damper for Ultrahigh-Speed Permanent-Magnet Machines With Gas Bearings","volume":"64","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7756302/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16723149","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7756302/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Magnetic Damper for Ultrahigh-Speed Permanent-Magnet Machines With Gas Bearings","sourcePdf":"tie-tuysuz-2632680-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085128S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7874245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7874245","articleId":"7756302","onlineDate":"24 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7756303,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245517/7837735/7756303/chen-2632858-small.gif","p":["Yu Chen (S\u201909\u2013M\u201911) received the B.E. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and electronic engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2006 and 2011, respectively.","From 2008 to 2009, he was an Intern with the GE Global Research Center, Shanghai, China.

As the voltage level in MVDC is much lower than that in high-voltage direct current case, the number of submodules (SMs) of MMC in MVDC system is also much less. Therefore, the SM failure will have more significant effect on the safety operation. Since uninterrupted operation is one of the most important requirements in electric ship application, the special redundancy design for MMC is required. This paper thus proposes an MMC system with hierarchical redundancy ability, aiming to guarantee the ride-through operation under SM failure. The \u201chot-reserved\u201d and \u201ccold-reserved\u201d SMs are prepared in the MMC by compromising the faulty SM number, voltage and current stress of SMs, SM power loss, and so on, and the hierarchical redundancy strategy is divided into several progressive layers to ride through the SM failure in different cases. The pretreatment units are designed to realize the proposed hierarchical redundant strategy smoothly, and without changing the existent modulation and sort-and-selection strategies designed for normal condition. The proposed design is explained in this paper, and verified by a three-phase MMC simulation and a single-phase MMC prototype.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245517/7837735/07756303.pdf","startPage":"189","endPage":"202","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JESTPE.2016.2632858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JESTPE.2016.2632858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7837735","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7756303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of a Modular Multilevel Converter With Hierarchical Redundancy Ability for Electric Ship MVDC System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Redundancy","Marine vehicles","Capacitors","Circuit faults","Power system stability","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC power transmission","electric vehicles","electrical safety","HVDC power convertors","marine power systems","voltage-source convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cold-reserved SM","current stress","SM power loss","sort-and-selection strategies","three-phase MMC simulation","single-phase MMC prototype","hot-reserved SM","ride-through operation","SM failure","switching loss","high-voltage quality","electric ship MVDC system","medium-voltage direct current power system","hierarchical redundancy ability","modular multilevel converter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electric ship","fault redundancy","medium-voltage direct current (MVDC)","modular multilevel converter (MMC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7756303/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of a Modular Multilevel Converter With Hierarchical Redundancy Ability for Electric Ship MVDC System","volume":"5","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7756303/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16638919","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Funds of State Grid Preliminary Research for High Voltage DC/DC Converters Suitable for DC Grids"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of a Modular Multilevel Converter With Hierarchical Redundancy Ability for Electric Ship MVDC System","sourcePdf":"jestpe-chen-2632858-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13609S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6245517","isNumber":"7837735","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245517","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"7837735","articleId":"7756303","onlineDate":"24 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7756308,"authors":[{"name":"Gaurav Baranwal","affiliation":["MMMUT, Gorakhpur, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4629386/8928988/7756308/baran-2632719-small.gif","p":["Gaurav Baranwal received the MTech degree in computer science from Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India, in 2013.

Reverse auction is a mechanism in which a customer prepares call for proposal of resource requirement and publicizes it in order to get the attention of eligible service providers. This work proposes a multi-attribute combinatorial reverse auction for Cloud resource procurement which considers price as well as non-price attributes such as quality of service parameters, reputation etc. in the determination of winning service providers. For this, the problem is formulated using approximation algorithm and near optimal solution is obtained in polynomial time. Auction mechanism allows providers to reveal true information in order to maximize their profit. It also imposes a penalty on the providers who cheat i.e., do not offer the agreed upon services. This makes the system robust as it maintains the utility of the customer. It also maintains a healthy competition among the providers. Performance evaluation and a comparative study with some base line models exhibit that the proposed method performs better.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services

Fully digital architectures are not feasible due to hardware limitations, and thus, the design of signal processing techniques for hybrid analog-digital architectures is of paramount importance. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid iterative block space-time receiver structure for multiuser mmW massive MIMO systems. We consider low-complexity user terminals employing analog-only random precoding and a single RF chain. At the base station, a hybrid analog-digital equalizer/detector is designed to efficiently remove the multiuser interference. The analog and digital parts of the equalizer are jointly optimized using as a metric the average bit-error-rate. The specificities of the analog domain impose several constraints in the joint optimization. To efficiently handle these constraints, the analog part is selected from a dictionary based on the array response vectors. We also propose a simple, yet an accurate semi-analytical approach for obtaining the performance of the proposed hybrid receiver structure. The results show that the performance of the hybrid iterative equalizer is close to the fully digital counterpart after only a few iterations. Moreover, it clearly outperforms the linear receivers recently considered for hybrid mmW massive MIMO architectures.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2632732","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7855844/07756319.pdf","startPage":"608","endPage":"620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2632732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Iterative Space-Time Equalization for Multi-User mmW Massive MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7756319","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Iterative Space-Time Equalization for Multi-User mmW Massive MIMO Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7756319/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16669145","htmlLink":"/document/7756319/","volume":"65","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001871","fundingName":"National Funds through FCT\u2013Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia","grantNumber":"PURE-5GNET (UID/EEA/50008/2013)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001871","fundingName":"FCT under the postdoctoral","grantNumber":"SFRH/BPD/95375/2013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Iterative Space-Time Equalization for Multi-User mmW Massive MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-castanheira-2632732-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.183781S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7855844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7855844","articleId":"7756319","onlineDate":"24 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7756320,"authors":[{"name":"Sajjad Taravati","affiliation":["Poly-Grames Research Center, \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7839250/7756320/tarav-2632735-small.gif","p":["Sajjad Taravati received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST), Tehran, Iran, in 2011.

This system operates as a full transceiver, where the upconversion and downconversion mixing operations are accomplished via space-time transitions; the duplexing operation is induced by the nonreciprocal nature of the structure, and the radiation operation is provided by the leaky-wave nature of the wave. A rigorous electromagnetic solution is derived for the dispersion relation and field distributions. The system is implemented in the form of a spatio-temporally modulated microstrip leaky-wave structure incorporating an array of subwavelengthly spaced varactors modulated by a harmonic wave. In addition to the overall mixer-duplexer-antenna operation, frequency beam scanning at fixed input frequency is demonstrated as one of the interesting features of the system. A prototype is realized and demonstrated by full-wave and experimental results.","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7839250/07756320.pdf","startPage":"442","endPage":"452","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7839250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2016.2632735","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2016.2632735","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7756320","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency modulation","Dispersion","Mixers","Periodic structures","Uplink","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["leaky wave antennas","microstrip antennas","radio transceivers","varactors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mixer-duplexer-antenna","leaky-wave system","periodic space-time modulation","full transceiver","upconversion mixing operations","downconversion mixing operations","space-time transitions","nonreciprocal nature","radiation operation","rigorous electromagnetic solution","dispersion relation","field distributions","spatiotemporal modulation","microstrip leaky-wave structure","subwavelengthly spaced varactors","harmonic wave","frequency beam scanning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Duplexer","leaky-wave antenna","mixer","nonreciprocity","space-time modulation","transceiver"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7756320/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Mixer-Duplexer-Antenna Leaky-Wave System Based on Periodic Space-Time Modulation","accessionNumber":"16639056","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7756320/","volume":"65","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mixer-Duplexer-Antenna Leaky-Wave System Based on Periodic Space-Time Modulation","sourcePdf":"tap-taravati-2632735-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075213S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7839250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"7839250","articleId":"7756320","onlineDate":"24 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7756323,"authors":[{"name":"Chang Liu","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7894295/7756323/liu-2632711-small.gif","p":["Chang Liu received the B.S. degree in electronic information engineering from Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China, in 2012.

In this paper, we focus on all the eigenvalues of sample covariance matrix in multi-antenna cognitive radio networks and propose eigenvalue weighting-based detection schemes. According to the Neyman-Pearson criterion, the globally optimal weighting solution is the likelihood ratio test (LRT). Hence, we analyze and derive the eigenvalue-based LRT (E-LRT). Utilizing the random matrix theory, a simple closed-form expression for the E-LRT is obtained, which is exactly the optimal eigenvalue weighting scheme. Although the E-LRT is optimal, it is infeasible in practice due to its dependence on the knowledge of primary users and noise powers. Hence, we further analyze suboptimal methods and design maximum likelihood estimation-based approximation weighting approach. Under the approach, both semi-blind (only the noise power is known) and totally-blind methods are correspondingly proposed. In addition, the theoretical performance analysis of these proposed methods are provided. Simulation results are presented to verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2632711","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7894295/07756323.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2632711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7894295","startPage":"2083","endPage":"2096","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Eigenvalue Weighting Detection for Multi-Antenna Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7756323","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7693/7894295/7756323-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Eigenvalue Weighting Detection for Multi-Antenna Cognitive Radio Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7756323/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16807566","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7756323/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671102, 61301130 and 61401059"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"DUT16QY33"},{"fundingName":"Scientific Research Staring Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars"},{"fundingName":"Xinghai Scholars Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1407679, CNS-1525226, CNS-1525418, CNS-1543830 and CNS-1617394"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Optimal Eigenvalue Weighting Detection for Multi-Antenna Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-liu-2632711-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088554S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7894295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7894295","articleId":"7756323","onlineDate":"24 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7756324,"authors":[{"name":"Valerio Bioglio","affiliation":["Mathematical and Algorithmic Sciences Laboratory, France Research Center, Huawei Technologies Company, Ltd., Boulogne-Billancourt, France"],"firstName":"Valerio","lastName":"Bioglio","orcid":"0000-0001-8418-5986","id":"37680888900"},{"name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gabry","affiliation":["Mathematical and Algorithmic Sciences Laboratory, France Research Center, Huawei Technologies Company, Ltd., Boulogne-Billancourt, France"],"firstName":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric","lastName":"Gabry","id":"37714434700"},{"name":"Lo\u00efg Godard","affiliation":["Mathematical and Algorithmic Sciences Laboratory, France Research Center, Huawei Technologies Company, Ltd., Boulogne-Billancourt, France"],"firstName":"Lo\u00efg","lastName":"Godard","id":"37689785600"},{"name":"Ingmar Land","affiliation":["Mathematical and Algorithmic Sciences Laboratory, France Research Center, Huawei Technologies Company, Ltd., Boulogne-Billancourt, France"],"firstName":"Ingmar","lastName":"Land","id":"37283061600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7756324","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1283},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7756324","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Decoding","Sorting","Hardware","Complexity theory","Indexes","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","decoding","error correction codes","linear codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-step metric sorting","parallel successive cancellation list decoding","polar codes","SCL decoding","PPU","path pruning unit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Polar codes","hardware decoding","list decoding","successive cancellation","sorting"]}],"abstract":"In terms of overall latency, one of the main bottlenecks of successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding of polar codes is the path pruning unit (PPU), whose goal is to prune 2L paths to L paths.

This paper also investigates an underlay spectrum sharing between the 3-D DSCs network and traditional cellular networks modeled by 2-D Poisson point processes. We take advantage of the tractability of the Poisson point process to derive the explicit expressions for the DSCs coverage probability and achievable throughput. To maximize the DSCs network throughput while satisfying the cellular network efficiency constraint, we find the optimal density of DSCs aerial base stations. Furthermore, we explore the scaling behavior of the optimal DSCs density with respect to the DSCs outage probability constraint under different heights of DSCs. Our analytical and numerical results show that the maximum throughput of the DSCs user increases almost linearly with the increase of the DSCs outage constraint. In order to protect the cellular user, the throughput of the DSCs user stops increasing when it meets the cellular network efficiency loss constraint. To further protect the cellular network in the spectrum underlay, we investigate the effect of primary exclusive regions (PERs) in a 3-D space. Unlike the circular PER in traditional cellular spectrum sharing in the 2-D space, the shape of the 3-D PER is found as a half sphere or a half sphere segment, depending on the radius of PER and the DSCs height limit. We show that the radius of PER should be restricted for small DSCs constraints and limited DSCs height.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7815452","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7815452/07756327.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2016.2633040","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2016.2633040","startPage":"136","endPage":"144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum Sharing for Drone Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7756327/","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Sharing for Drone Networks","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7756327/","volume":"35","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"16598343","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council\u2019s Discovery Projects funding scheme","grantNumber":"DP160104903"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Sharing for Drone Networks","sourcePdf":"jsac-zhang-2633040-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069662S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7815452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7815452","articleId":"7756327","onlineDate":"24 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7756328,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Specifically, inkjet printing technology has been increasingly applied as advanced deposition technology in the field of printed electronics due to the high flexibility in terms of patterns (mask-less) and materials, and its low cost approach as only a small amount of materials is required in comparison to other solution-based deposition techniques. Our work focuses on the development of Organic Thin Film Transistors (OTFTs) by using organic, inorganic inks and low-cost all-inkjet purely printing process, thus centring the effort in the design, manufacturing and characterization point of view in order to fabricate all-inkjet printed organic integrated circuits. Electrical and morphological characterizations were performed in order to obtain device statistics to investigate the origins of the failures responsible for the low yields. Most of research works are based on laboratory inkjet equipment for manufacturing using single nozzle systems to fabricate small numbers of devices. The variability and mismatch of the printed devices are underrepresented in literature and are key factors towards commercialization of printed electronics.","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2016.2617205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2016.2617205","startPage":"161","endPage":"170","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503868/7879373/07756328.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7879373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a Simple Manufacturing Process for All-Inkjet Printed Organic Thin Film Transistors and Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7756328/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Development of a Simple Manufacturing Process for All-Inkjet Printed Organic Thin Film Transistors and Circuits","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16759841","publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7756328/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Spanish government","grantNumber":"ASPEC-TDK (TEC2011-29800) and SIRX-MMT (TEC2014-59679)"},{"fundingName":"Catalan","grantNumber":"2014-SGR-01452"},{"fundingName":"EU FP7","grantNumber":"TDK4PE (contract 287682)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a Simple Manufacturing Process for All-Inkjet Printed Organic Thin Film Transistors and Circuits","sourcePdf":"jetcas-ramon-2617205-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08157S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"7879373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7879373","articleId":"7756328","onlineDate":"24 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7756329,"authors":[{"name":"Jianfei Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jianfei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086069490"},{"name":"Xiongbin Wu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xiongbin","lastName":"Wu","id":"37966306000"},{"name":"William J.

Based on a new mixing matrix and the reconstruction of the array output vector of each individual signal, we propose a novel DOA estimation and sensor array error calibration procedure. This method is independent of array phase errors and performs well against difference of SNR of signals.

However, intensity modulation and direct detection (IMDD) DFMA PONs suffer from imperfect channel orthogonality-induced cross-channel interference. In this paper, a DFMA channel interference cancellation (DCIC) technique is, for the first time, proposed and extensively investigated, to significantly improve the downstream and upstream performance of the IMDD DFMA PONs. A comprehensive DCIC theoretical model is developed, and through fitting with experimental measurements, the developed theoretical model is rigorously verified and a set of accurate transceiver/system parameters is identified. It is shown that DCIC increases the aggregated upstream signal transmission capacity by a factor of > 2 and extends the differential optical network unit (ONU) launch power dynamic range by approximately 14 dB. Such significant performance improvements are achieved after just one iteration. Other salient DCIC advantages include ONU count-independent low DSP complexity, small latency and transparency to signal modulation format, signal bit rate, and initial system operation conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7852556/07756334.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"44","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2016.2632861","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2016.2632861","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7852556","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7756334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple Channel Interference Cancellation of Digital Filter Multiple Access PONs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Passive optical networks","Optical network units","Optical fibers","Optical filters","Digital filters","Digital signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","digital filters","intensity modulation","interference suppression","optical fibre networks","optical information processing","optical modulation","optical transceivers","passive optical networks","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple channel interference cancellation","digital filter multiple access PON","digital signal processing based software-reconfigurable digital orthogonal filtering digital filter multiple access passive optical networks","backward compatibility","cloud access networks","intensity modulation and direct detection DFMA PON","channel orthogonality-induced cross-channel interference","DFMA channel interference cancellation technique","IMDD DFMA PON","comprehensive DCIC theoretical model","transceiver","system parameters","aggregated upstream signal transmission capacity","differential optical network unit launch power","salient DCIC","ONU count-independent low DSP complexity","signal modulation format","signal bit rate","initial system operation conditions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital orthogonal filtering","digital signal processing (DSP)","interference cancellation","passive optical networks (PONs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7756334/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1, 1 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Channel Interference Cancellation of Digital Filter Multiple Access PONs","volume":"35","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7756334/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Jan.1, 2017","accessionNumber":"16669280","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"The Ser Cymru National Research Network in Advanced Engineering and Materials","grantNumber":"NRN024 and NRN147"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Channel Interference Cancellation of Digital Filter Multiple Access PONs","sourcePdf":"jlt-tang-2632861-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126967S","chronDate":"Jan.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7852556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7852556","articleId":"7756334","onlineDate":"24 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7756338,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed F.

Critical analysis is based on the proper cylindrically radial wave functions, which result in a usable numerical dispersion relation for all space, including the near vicinity of the axis of rotation. The corresponding stability criterion is also derived. The focus of dispersion analysis presented here is on numerical accuracy and stability limits within close proximity to the axis of rotation as they change with the rotational mode order. Simulation experiments are included to verify the accuracy of derived dispersion and stability formulas. An important result obtained is the confirmation and accurate prediction of relatively dense grids when modeling increasing rotational mode orders. Furthermore, the precise formulas derived here are critical to future precision implementations of auxiliary modeling tools, such as controlled source injection and absorbing boundary conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2016.2633069","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7839250/07756338.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2016.2633069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7839250","startPage":"721","endPage":"729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radial Waves Based Dispersion Analysis of the Body-of-Revolution FDTD Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7756338","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Radial Waves Based Dispersion Analysis of the Body-of-Revolution FDTD Method","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7756338/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16639026","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7756338/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radial Waves Based Dispersion Analysis of the Body-of-Revolution FDTD Method","sourcePdf":"tap-hadi-2633069-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061962S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7839250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7839250","articleId":"7756338","onlineDate":"24 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":7756340,"authors":[{"name":"Guipeng Chen","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7981437/7756340/chen-2633068-small.gif","p":["Guipeng Chen (S'16) received the B.E.E. degree from Zhejiang\n University, Hangzhou, China, in 2011, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include soft-switching dc\u2013dc converters, bi-directional dc\u2013dc converters,\n and multiport dc\u2013dc converters."]},"firstName":"Guipeng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085386106"},{"name":"Yan Deng","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7981437/7756340/deng-2633068-small.gif","p":["Yan Deng received the B.E.E. degree and Ph.D. degree in power\n electronics and electric drives from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 1994 and 2000, respectively.","Since 2000, he has been a Faculty Member with Zhejiang University, teaching and conducting research on power\n electronics.

Also elaborated harmonic tuning and neutralization techniques are used to further improve the transistor gain and stability. A two-stack PA is designed for higher gain and output power than a common source (CS) PA. Additionally, average power tracking (APT) is applied to further reduce the power consumption at a low power operation and, hence, extend battery life.

In the current centralized DSA designs, the operation data of both government IUs and commercial SUs need to be shared with a central server. However, the operation data of government IUs are often classified information and the SU operation data may also be commercial secrets. The current system design dissatisfies the privacy requirement of both IUs and SUs, since the central server is not necessarily trustworthy for holding such sensitive operation data. To address the privacy issue, this paper presents a privacy-preserving centralized DSA system (P\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n-SAS), which realizes the complex spectrum allocation process of DSA through efficient secure multi-party computation.

The deployment of long term evolution (LTE) in unlicensed spectrum (LTE-U) is a promising solution to overcome such a barrier. However, the interaction between LTE-U and Wi-Fi in unlicensed spectrum has not been well understood. In this paper, we use stochastic geometry to develop a framework for a multi-radio access technologies (multi-RAT) heterogeneous network, which consists of an LTE-U tier and a Wi-Fi tier. To reduce the intra- and inter-RAT interference, LTE-U employs an ALOHA-like random access scheme and Wi-Fi performs carrier sensing and energy detection before transmission. We derive the coverage probability and spatial throughput of Wi-Fi and LTE-U networks, and perform the asymptotic analysis when the density of Wi-Fi and LTE-U nodes approach infinity. Based on our analysis, we investigate the effect of network parameters on the coverage probability and spatial throughput of these networks. Furthermore, in order to achieve weighted max-min fairness, we optimize the retention probability of LTE-U nodes to maximize the minimum weighted spatial throughput of Wi-Fi and LTE-U networks.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2016.2632629","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7815452/07756350.pdf","startPage":"63","endPage":"78","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2016.2632629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7815452","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput and Fairness Analysis of Wi-Fi and LTE-U in Unlicensed Band","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Throughput and Fairness Analysis of Wi-Fi and LTE-U in Unlicensed Band","volume":"35","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16598349","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7756350/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7756350/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61301176, 61231008, 91638202 and 91338114"},{"fundingName":"863 project","grantNumber":"2014AA01A701"},{"fundingName":"National S&T Major Project","grantNumber":"2016ZX03001022-003"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"JB160106"},{"fundingName":"SUTD-ZJU Research Collaboration","grantNumber":"SUTD-ZJU/RES/01/2014"},{"fundingName":"MOE ARF Tier 2","grantNumber":"MOE2015-T2-2-104"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput and Fairness Analysis of Wi-Fi and LTE-U in Unlicensed Band","sourcePdf":"jsac-sheng-2632629-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154568S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7815452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7815452","articleId":"7756350","onlineDate":"24 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7756352,"authors":[{"name":"Ye Li","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Nantong University, Nantong, China"],"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0002-3279-8083","id":"37086033726"},{"name":"Jun Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Zhu","orcid":"0000-0002-1773-548X","id":"38666362400"},{"name":"Zhihua Bao","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Nantong University, Nantong, China"],"firstName":"Zhihua","lastName":"Bao","orcid":"0000-0002-1955-4965","id":"37400398100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7756352","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":515},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Indexes","Precoding","Network coding","Electronic mail","Linear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix algebra","network coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse random linear network coding","precoded band codes","band matrices","lossy networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sparse network code","band matrix","recoding"]}],"abstract":"This letter proposes a sparse network code based on band matrices for lossy networks.

In this paper, we implement the IGS scheme in an overlay cognitive radio system, where the secondary transmitter broadcasts a mixture of two different signals. The first signal is selected from the PGS scheme to match the primary message transmission. On the other hand, the second signal is chosen to be from the IGS scheme in order to reduce the interference effect on the primary receiver. We then optimally design the overlay cognitive radio to maximize the secondary link achievable rate while satisfying the primary network quality of service requirements. In particular, we consider full and partial channel knowledge scenarios and derive the feasibility conditions of operating the overlay cognitive radio systems.

The availability of high-dimensional channel side information (CSI) is critical for its promised performance gains, but the overhead of acquiring CSI may potentially deplete the available radio resources. Fortunately, it has recently been discovered that harnessing various sparsity structures in massive MIMO channels can lead to significant overhead reduction, and thus improve the system performance. This paper presents and discusses the use of sparsity-inspired CSI acquisition techniques for massive MIMO, as well as the underlying mathematical theory. Sparsity-inspired approaches for both frequency-division duplexing and time-division duplexing massive MIMO systems will be examined and compared from an overall system perspective, including the design tradeoffs between the two duplexing modes, computational complexity of acquisition algorithms, and applicability of sparsity structures. Meanwhile, some future prospects for research on high-dimensional CSI acquisition to meet practical demands will be identified.","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2015.2448661","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/7875385/07756364.pdf","startPage":"32","endPage":"40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2015.2448661","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7875385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Dimensional CSI Acquisition in Massive MIMO: Sparsity-Inspired Approaches","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7756364","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7756364/","displayDocTitle":"High-Dimensional CSI Acquisition in Massive MIMO: Sparsity-Inspired Approaches","volume":"11","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16724833","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7756364/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Hong Kong Research Grant Council","grantNumber":"610212"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Dimensional CSI Acquisition in Massive MIMO: Sparsity-Inspired Approaches","sourcePdf":"jsyst-shen-2448661-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08938S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"7875385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7875385","articleId":"7756364","onlineDate":"24 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7756368,"authors":[{"name":"Raghu Vamsi Krishna Chavali","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA","Intel Corporation, Boise, ID, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503869/7786976/7756368/chava-2621346-small.gif","p":["Raghu Vamsi Krishna Chavali received the B.E.

The proposed predictive speed controller has a cascade-free structure that comprises a single predictive control function for the speed and dq-axis stator currents. The future rotor speed and stator currents are predicted at each sampling interval. Then, the proposed predictive control function is evaluated to determine the optimal switching states for the IPMSM drive. In high-performance speed-controlled drive, the unknown load torque disturbance has to be suppressed. Therefore, the load torque disturbance estimator using the two-stage extended Kalman filter (TSEKF) is proposed to enhance the dynamic performance of the IPMSM drive. The proposed TSEKF simultaneously estimates the system states, which greatly improve the model prediction process. The proposed predictive speed control is simple and compact, which demonstrates a faster transient response and a robust feature to mechanical system parameter variations when compared with the conventional cascaded speed control under a wide speed range and load torque variations. The experimental results on a prototype IPMSM drive built on a Texas Instruments TMS320F28335 floating point digital signal processing (DSP) board are presented considering the constant torque and flux-weakening regions to confirm the feasibility of the proposed FCS-MPC scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2016.2632859","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2016.2632859","startPage":"762","endPage":"773","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/3516/7900484/07756371.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7900484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite Set Model Predictive Control of Interior PM Synchronous Motor Drives With an External Disturbance Rejection Technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","displayDocTitle":"Finite Set Model Predictive Control of Interior PM Synchronous Motor Drives With an External Disturbance Rejection Technique","publicationDate":"April 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2017","volume":"22","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7756371/","accessionNumber":"16808501","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7756371/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingName":"Korea government [Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning (MSIP)]","grantNumber":"2015R1A2A2A01003513"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite Set Model Predictive Control of Interior PM Synchronous Motor Drives With an External Disturbance Rejection Technique","sourcePdf":"tmech-jung-2632859-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109719S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"7900484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7900484","articleId":"7756371","onlineDate":"24 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7756372,"authors":[{"name":"Shan Yin","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Shan Yin received the Ph.D. degree in communication engineering from\n Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2014.

With more data capacity, physical network failure (i.e., link or node) will lead to more communication disruptions, especially for multiple failures. In previous research, the protection strategies against multiple failures is mainly single-path provisioning (SPP). They require multiple diverse routes and allocate protection resource separately, which are resource consuming. With the advantages of partial protection and lower resources consumption, the multipath provisioning (MPP) scheme has been considered in traditional wavelength-division multiplexing network, where traffic is split into multiple lower-rate streams and each stream is separately routed. In MPP, the number of required paths and the amount of resource allocated for each path are the two important parameters to be determined and will have great impact on the spectrum efficiency. In light of the above discussion, a spectrum-efficient shared-protection MPP (S-MPP) scheme against multiple failures in FONs is proposed. It is formulated as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model and a heuristic algorithm is also developed. Also, the determination of the number of paths and the resource requirement of each path in FON is analyzed in this paper. Furthermore, with MPP, the shared protection in FON is different from that with SPP, because the paths are equal in MPP (no primary path or backup path) and sharing partial path is available. Therefore, we discuss the partial sharing scheme and analyze the amount of shared spectrum resource on each path. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed S-MPP scheme in FON achieves a significant gain on spectrum efficiency with enough protection against multiple failures. Moreover, the performance of the proposed heuristic algorithm is very close to the optimal solution achieved by solving ILP.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7852551/07756372.pdf","startPage":"201","endPage":"211","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2016.2632759","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2016.2632759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7852551","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7756372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shared-Protection Survivable Multipath Scheme in Flexible-Grid Optical Networks Against Multiple Failures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber networks","Resource management","WDM networks","Routing","Bandwidth","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heuristic programming","integer programming","linear programming","optical fibre networks","telecommunication network planning","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication network routing","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shared-protection survivable multipath scheme","flexible-grid optical networks","multiple failures","fixed-grid optical network","FON","spectrum efficiency","data capacity","physical network failure","communication disruptions","protection strategies","single-path provisioning","SPP","multiple diverse routes","protection resource","partial protection","multipath provisioning scheme","traditional wavelength-division multiplexing network","multiple lower-rate streams","spectrum-efficient shared-protection MPP scheme","integer linear programming model","heuristic algorithm","resource requirement","partial path","partial sharing scheme","spectrum resource","S-MPP scheme","ILP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Flexible-grid optical network","multipath provisioning","multiple failures","resource sharing","routing and resource assignment","survivability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7756372/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15, 15 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Shared-Protection Survivable Multipath Scheme in Flexible-Grid Optical Networks Against Multiple Failures","volume":"35","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7756372/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"15 Jan.15, 2017","accessionNumber":"16669265","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61331008, 61601054 and 61571058"},{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation for Outstanding Youth Scholars of China","grantNumber":"61622102"},{"fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shared-Protection Survivable Multipath Scheme in Flexible-Grid Optical Networks Against Multiple Failures","sourcePdf":"jlt-huang-2632759-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102356S","chronDate":"Jan.15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7852551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7852551","articleId":"7756372","onlineDate":"24 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7756376,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Cao","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/8318008/7756376/cao-2613600-small.gif","p":["Yue Cao (M\u201916) received the Ph.D. degree from the Institute for Communication Systems (ICS) (formerly known as Centre for Communication Systems Research), University of Surrey, Guildford, U.K., in 2013.","He was a Research Fellow with the ICS.

However, due to the limited electricity of battery, EV drivers may experience discomfort for long charging waiting time during their journeys. This often happens when a large number of (on-the-move) EVs are planning to charge at the same CS, but it has been heavily overloaded. With this concern, in an EV charging management system, we focus on CS-selection decision making and propose a scheme to manage EVs' charging plans, to minimize drivers' trip duration through intermediate charging at CSs. The proposed scheme jointly considers EVs' anticipated charging reservations (including arrival time and expected charging time) and parking duration at CSs. Furthermore, by tackling mobility uncertainty that EVs may not reach their planned CSs on time (due to traffic jams on the road), a periodical reservation updating mechanism is designed to adjust their charging plans. Results under the Helsinki city scenario with realistic EV and CS characteristics show the advantage of our proposal, in terms of minimized drivers' trip duration, as well as charging performance at the EV and CS sides.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2016.2613600","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/8318008/07756376.pdf","startPage":"596","endPage":"607","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2016.2613600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8318008","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An EV Charging Management System Concerning Drivers\u2019 Trip Duration and Mobility Uncertainty","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7756376","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7756376/","displayDocTitle":"An EV Charging Management System Concerning Drivers\u2019 Trip Duration and Mobility Uncertainty","volume":"48","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17617457","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7756376/","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61102105"},{"fundingName":"Post-Doctoral Start Foundation of Heilongjiang Province","grantNumber":"LBH-Q12117"},{"fundingName":"Foundation for Innovative Research of Harbin","grantNumber":"2015RAQXJ008"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"GK2080260138"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An EV Charging Management System Concerning Drivers\u2019 Trip Duration and Mobility Uncertainty","sourcePdf":"tsmc-wang-2613600-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11459S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"8318008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"8318008","articleId":"7756376","onlineDate":"24 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7756377,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Liang Wang","affiliation":["Tianjin Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Detection Technology and System, Tianjin Polytechnic University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8262690/7756377/wang-2627083-small.gif","p":["Jin-Liang Wang received the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from the School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2014.","In 2014, he joined the School of Computer Science & Software Engineering, Tianjin Polytechnic University, Tianjin, China.

We, respectively, investigate the passivity and the relationship between output strict passivity and output synchronization of the complex dynamical network with fixed and adaptive coupling strength. First, two new passivity definitions are proposed, which generalize some existing concepts of passivity. By constructing appropriate Lyapunov functional, some sufficient conditions ensuring the passivity, input strict passivity and output strict passivity are derived for the complex dynamical network with fixed coupling strength. In addition, we also reveal the relationship between output strict passivity and output synchronization of the complex dynamical network with fixed coupling strength. By employing the relationship between output strict passivity and output synchronization, a sufficient condition for output synchronization of the complex dynamical network with fixed coupling strength is established. Then, we extend these results to the case when the coupling strength is adaptively adjusted. Finally, two examples with numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed criteria.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7756377/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","volume":"29","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7756377/","accessionNumber":"17519486","pubMedId":"27898384","displayDocTitle":"Passivity and Output Synchronization of Complex Dynamical Networks With Fixed and Adaptive Coupling Strength","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61403275, 61473011, 61625302 and 61672171"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006606","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin, China","grantNumber":"15JCQNJC04100"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008982","fundingName":"National Priorities Research Program (NPRP) from the Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation)","grantNumber":"NPRP 8-274-2-107"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passivity and Output Synchronization of Complex Dynamical Networks With Fixed and Adaptive Coupling Strength","sourcePdf":"tnnls-wang-2627083-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064882S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8262690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"8262690","articleId":"7756377","onlineDate":"24 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7756389,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Chu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Nantong University, Nan Tong, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Chu","orcid":"0000-0001-6895-4298","id":"37596188400"},{"name":"Yong-Xin Guo","affiliation":["National University of Singapore Suzhou Research Institute, Suzhou, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yong-Xin","lastName":"Guo","id":"37277882000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"7756389","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2793},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Substrates","Antenna arrays","Dielectric resonator antennas","Feeds","Dielectrics","Couplings","Resonant frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","dielectric materials","dielectric resonator antennas","microwave antenna arrays","millimetre wave antenna arrays","printed circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimeter-wave antenna array","dielectric resonator antenna array","substrate integrated technology","feeding network","printed circuit board technology","dielectric materials","mounting errors","antenna element","linear polarization","circular polarization","Ka-band","four-element antenna arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cofabrication","dielectric resonator antenna (DRA)","millimeter-wave (mm-wave) antenna","substrate integrated antenna"]}],"abstract":"This communication describes a novel concept of designing millimeter-wave (mm-wave) dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) arrays, in which the DRA element and part of its feeding network can be codesigned and cofabricated using the printed circuit board technology. Conventionally, the DRA and its feed are designed and fabricated using different dielectric materials. As a result, a large error might take place when mounting the DRA to its feed, which will result in significant influences to the performance of the antenna, especially to those operating in the mm-wave band. The proposed concept of the substrate integrated DRA provides a possibility to minimize the above mounting errors, by shaping the DRA and its feed together using the same material and fabrication process. Two kinds of antenna element, which separately exhibits linear and circular polarization, are designed at Ka-band. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed elements for array applications, two four-element antenna arrays in cooperation with different feeding networks and transitions are also designed, fabricated, and measured. Investigations show good agreement between simulation and measurement. The proposed substrate integrated DRA array can be easily extended to larger scales and has great potential to be integrated into mm-wave transceiver modules.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2016.2632702","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7839250/07756389.pdf","startPage":"909","endPage":"914","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2016.2632702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7839250","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7756389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Approach for Millimeter-Wave Dielectric Resonator Antenna Array Designs by Using the Substrate Integrated Technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Approach for Millimeter-Wave Dielectric Resonator Antenna Array Designs by Using the Substrate Integrated Technology","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7756389/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","volume":"65","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7756389/","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16639015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61301044"},{"fundingName":"Suzhou Science and Technology Council, China","grantNumber":"SYG201403"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Approach for Millimeter-Wave Dielectric Resonator Antenna Array Designs by Using the Substrate Integrated Technology","sourcePdf":"tap-chu-2632702-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05295S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7839250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7839250","articleId":"7756389","onlineDate":"24 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":7756397,"authors":[{"name":"Weijia Han","affiliation":["Shaanxi Normal University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7815452/7756397/han-2633079-small.gif","p":["Weijia Han (S\u201907\u2013M\u201911) received the B.S. degree from Northwest University, China, the M.S. degree from Queen\u2019s University Belfast, U.K., and the Ph.D. degree from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China.

Accordingly, spectrum aggregation (SA) is proposed as an emerging solution to efficiently utilize the dispersive resource. To address such a challenging issue, this paper introduces power domain into the conventional SA which only works in the time and frequency domains, and extends the resource block (RB), which is a time-frequency spectrum management unit in LTE standard, to a time-frequency-power spectrum unit termed resource cube. Based on this, a novel radio resource management (RRM) scheme is proposed to manage the spectrum with multiplexing division in time, frequency, and power domains (3D) simultaneously. Through theoretical derivations, we show that under certain simplifications, the proposed 3D RRM could be formulated as a convex objective function with linear constrains, and can be solved with low computational complexity. When compared with the conventional RB-based RRM, the proposed 3D RRM matches the real-time requirement in SA. Furthermore, it is proved that the proposed scheme could achieve better energy efficiency than the RB-based ones.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7815452/07756397.pdf","startPage":"106","endPage":"117","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2016.2633079","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2016.2633079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7815452","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7756397","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient 3D Resource Management for Spectrum Aggregation in Cellular Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Time-frequency analysis","Resource management","Quality of service","Frequency conversion","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","Long Term Evolution","mobility management (mobile radio)","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D resource management","spectrum aggregation","cellular networks","mobile communication","resource block","time-frequency spectrum management","LTE","radio resource management","multiplexing division","3D RRM","low computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spectrum aggregation","power division multiplexing","radio resource management","resource block","resource cube"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7756397/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Efficient 3D Resource Management for Spectrum Aggregation in Cellular Networks","volume":"35","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7756397/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16598347","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401320, 61501285, 61501093, 61231008, 61301176 and 61401354"},{"fundingName":"Thousand Youth Talents Plan in China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007128","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2014JQ2-6032"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"GK201503018, GK201603085 and JB160115"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient 3D Resource Management for Spectrum Aggregation in Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"jsac-huang-2633079-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138649S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7815452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7815452","articleId":"7756397","onlineDate":"24 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7756400,"authors":[{"name":"Albert Molina","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7870723/7756400/molin-2627562-small.gif","p":["Albert Molina was born in Spain in 1966.

Wideband spectrum sharing and sensing constitute highly desirable features of CR systems as they aim to increase the probability of identifying available spectral bands, which ensures a more efficient resource utilization. This paper proposes an efficient frequency-domain cyclic prefix autocorrelation-based wideband spectrum sensing and sharing method that can provide accurate detection of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based primaries in wideband CR systems. Novel analytic expressions are derived for the corresponding threshold, probability of false alarm, and probability of detection in the presence of noise uncertainty (NU) and frequency selectivity. The derived models are validated by extensive comparisons with respective results from computer simulations. It is demonstrated that the introduced autocorrelation-based sensing method is able to counteract NU and the frequency-selective multipath channel effects in realistic wideband communication scenarios. Furthermore, the method facilitates partial band sensing, allowing the sensing of weak OFDM-type primary user (PU) signals in channels, which are partly overlapped by other strong PU or CR transmissions. This is considered a crucial element in practical spectrum sharing scenarios. Since the proposed sensing method makes use of sparsity in the spectral domain, it can be technically considered as compressed sensing method. The flexibility of this approach supports robust wideband multi-mode, multi-channel sensing with low complexity. Finally, it is shown that the offered results are particularly useful in the context of spectrum sharing as their high performance and reduced complexity can enable the co-existence of non-exhaustive yet highly efficient algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7756405/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"35","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16598352","htmlLink":"/document/7756405/","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Frequency Domain Spectrum Sensing and Sharing Based on Cyclic Prefix Autocorrelation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Academy of Finland","grantNumber":"251138, 284694, 284724 and 288670"},{"fundingName":"Finnish Cultural Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Frequency Domain Spectrum Sensing and Sharing Based on Cyclic Prefix Autocorrelation","sourcePdf":"jsac-dikmese-2633058-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120413S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7815452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7815452","articleId":"7756405","onlineDate":"24 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7756408,"authors":[{"name":"Dani Korpi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Dani","lastName":"Korpi","orcid":"0000-0003-3460-7436","id":"37085491520"},{"name":"Mikko Heino","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Mikko","lastName":"Heino","id":"37085405737"},{"name":"Clemens Icheln","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Clemens","lastName":"Icheln","id":"37273178800"},{"name":"Katsuyuki Haneda","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Katsuyuki","lastName":"Haneda","id":"37269842700"},{"name":"Mikko Valkama","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Mikko","lastName":"Valkama","id":"37267657500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"7756408","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1808},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7756408","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","Radio frequency","Relays","Antenna measurements","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","receiving antennas","relays","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact inband full-duplex relays","self-interference suppression","self-interference channel","transmit antenna ports","receive antenna ports","passive isolation","receiver noise floor","bandwidth 80 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna design","digital cancellation","full duplex","isolation","relay","RF measurements","self-interference (SI)"]}],"abstract":"In this communication, the self-interference (SI) channel and the novel enabling techniques for a compact inband full-duplex relay are described and characterized in different operating environments.

The passive isolation is complemented with novel active RF and digital cancellation stages that further suppress the residual SI to the receiver noise floor. Measurement results of a complete prototype implementation show that the proposed design can achieve an overall SI cancellation performance of over 100 dB even with an ambitious instantaneous bandwidth of 80 MHz.

The approach consists of two elements. First, a passive low-pass filter is added in front of the modulator's loop filter to reduce the high frequency components in the loop. As a result, the slew rate requirements of the opamps can be greatly reduced which allows a significant power saving. Unfortunately, the insertion of this low-pass filter also changes the modulator's loop gain, and hence affects the noise transfer functions (NTFs) and signal transfer functions (STFs), in an undesired way. Therefore, the second proposed element consists of inserting a compensation branch which is such that the original loop gain, NTF and STF are restored. Thanks to this, our power saving technique is completely transparent on the system level such that all established techniques and toolboxes for CTSDM design can still be used. The technique is especially suited for one-bit CTSDMs, where the amount of high-frequency components in the loop is excessive. To showcase the technique, a self-oscillating sigma-delta modulator (which is a dedicated type of one-bit CTSDM) was implemented in a 65-nm CMOS process. It achieves a peak signal to noise and distortion ratio of 63 dB over a 20-MHz bandwidth at a power consumption of 1.7 mW while occupying a very small chip area of only 0.009 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2016.2633002","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8048686/07756410.pdf","startPage":"1157","endPage":"1161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8048686","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2016.2633002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Passive Loop Filter Assistance for CTSDMs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7756410","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Passive Loop Filter Assistance for CTSDMs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7756410/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17205544","htmlLink":"/document/7756410/","volume":"64","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003130","fundingName":"Fund for Scientific Research Flanders (FWO-Vlaanderen), Belgium"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Passive Loop Filter Assistance for CTSDMs","sourcePdf":"tcsii-vercaemer-2633002-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096947S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8048686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8048686","articleId":"7756410","onlineDate":"24 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7756411,"authors":[{"name":"Namshik Kim","affiliation":["ReCoLab Inc., Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Namshik","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279220700"},{"name":"Jinwoo Kim","affiliation":["ReCoLab Inc., Suwon, South Korea","School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jinwoo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086028474"},{"name":"Seung-Chan Lim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seung-Chan","lastName":"Lim","orcid":"0000-0002-7630-8533","id":"37086069580"},{"name":"Hyuncheol Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyuncheol","lastName":"Park","id":"37277121400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"7756411","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":434},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Detectors","Signal to noise ratio","Decoding","Interference","Bit error rate","Iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","error statistics","interleaved codes","MIMO communication","receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BER","MIMO-BICM system","bit error rate","multiple-input multiple-output bit-interleaved coded modulation system","iterative receiver","soft-in soft-out minimum mean square error detector","SISO channel decoder","maximal ratio combining system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-input multiple-output bit-interleaved coded modulation (MIMO-BICM) system","iterative receiver","minimum mean square error (MMSE)","bit error rate (BER)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7756411","abstract":"In this letter, we analyze the bit error rate (BER) of a multiple-input multiple-output bit-interleaved coded modulation (MIMO-BICM) system with an iterative receiver that consists of a soft-in soft-out (SISO) minimum mean square error detector and an SISO channel decoder.

By an asymptotic approach, we also show that the BER of the MIMO-BICM system with an iterative receiver converges to that of the maximal ratio combining system.","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2016.2632714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2016.2632714","startPage":"78","endPage":"81","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/7857815/07756411.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7857815","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER of MIMO-BICM System at Current Detection/Decoding Cycle","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","displayDocTitle":"BER of MIMO-BICM System at Current Detection/Decoding Cycle","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","volume":"6","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7756411/","accessionNumber":"16690209","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7756411/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"\u2018The Cross-Ministry Giga KOREA Project\u2019 grant from the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, South Korea"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER of MIMO-BICM System at Current Detection/Decoding Cycle","sourcePdf":"lwc-lim-2632714-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045957S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"7857815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","xplore-issue":"7857815","articleId":"7756411","onlineDate":"24 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7756415,"authors":[{"name":"Kewei Qian","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China","Department of Research and Design, Shenzhen Wyzdom Wireless Co., Ltd, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Kewei","lastName":"Qian","id":"37719396000"},{"name":"Luyu Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Research and Design, Shenzhen Wyzdom Wireless Co., Ltd, Shenzhen, China","School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Luyu","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38546777900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"7756415","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":979},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antennas","Antenna measurements","IEEE 802.11 Standard","MIMO","Performance evaluation","Admittance","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","microwave antenna arrays","MIMO communication","multifrequency antennas","printed circuit design","UHF antennas","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wearable devices","smartphones","mobile Wi-Fi hotspots","AIC^2 chip design","IEEE 802.11 n/ac dual-band application","MIMO antennas","multilayer low temperature co-fired ceramic technology","semilumped components","dual-band multiple-input multiple-output antennas","frequency rejection characteristics","integrated antenna interference cancellation chip","frequency 2.4 GHz","frequency 5.8 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna array mutual coupling","antenna diversity","antenna interference cancellation","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) systems","mutual coupling","Wi-Fi hotspot"]}],"abstract":"An integrated antenna interference cancellation chip (AIC^2) reducing the inevitable interference between two closely located dual-band multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antennas is introduced.

We consider a network of two user equipments (UEs), a macro-cell base station (BS) and a small-cell BS. Joint SMC involves macro-to-small quantized feedback and decode-forward relaying from small to macro cell. This cooperation utilizes full-duplex transmission and intra-network spectrum sharing. We first propose a transmission scheme based on superposition block Markov encoding at each UE, coherent decode-forward relaying and sliding window decoding at the small-cell BS, and quantize-forward relaying and backward decoding at the macro-cell BS. Second, we derive the optimal macro-cell quantization to maximize the whole spectral efficiency. Third, for a certain non-fading scenario, we prove that the proposed scheme asymptotically achieves the capacity (maximum spectral efficiency) by reaching the cut-set bound as macro-cell power approaches infinity. Fourth, we formulate the outage probability over block fading channels, considering the outage events at the small and macro-cell BSs and the channel variations over different blocks. Last, we generalize the proposed scheme to an N (>2)-UE case. As macro-cell power increases, the results show that the proposed scheme achieves a full diversity order of two and outperforms all existing non-SMC schemes. These strong results suggest the utility of the proposed scheme for potential deployment in 5G cellular networks.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2016.2633039","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7815452/07756416.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2016.2633039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7815452","startPage":"118","endPage":"135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Small-Macro Cell Cooperation for HetNet Uplink Transmission: Spectral Efficiency and Reliability Analyses","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7756416","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Small-Macro Cell Cooperation for HetNet Uplink Transmission: Spectral Efficiency and Reliability Analyses","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7756416/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16598354","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7756416/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small-Macro Cell Cooperation for HetNet Uplink Transmission: Spectral Efficiency and Reliability Analyses","sourcePdf":"jsac-alhaija-2633039-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130183S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7815452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","xplore-issue":"7815452","articleId":"7756416","onlineDate":"24 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7756633,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-Geun Bae","affiliation":["department of electrical engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7845730/7756633/bae-2625341-small.gif","p":["Sang-Geun Bae (S\u201911) was born in Chuncheon, South Korea, in 1984.

Extractive summarization aims to generate a summary of a document or a set of documents by ranking sentences and the ranking results rely heavily on the quality of sentence features. However, almost all previous algorithms require hand-crafted features for sentence representation. In this paper, we leverage on word embedding to represent sentences so as to avoid the intensive labor in feature engineering. An enhanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs) termed multiview CNNs is successfully developed to obtain the features of sentences and rank sentences jointly.

While for some applications integer and fixed-point arithmetic suffice, others require a larger dynamic range, typically obtained using floating-point (FP) numbers. Logarithmic number systems (LNSs) have been proposed as energy-efficient alternative, since several complex FP operations translate into simple integer operations. However, additions and subtractions become nonlinear operations, which have to be approximated via interpolation. Even efficient LNS units (LNUs) are still larger than standard FP units (FPUs), rendering them impractical for most general-purpose processors. We show that, when shared among several cores, LNUs become a very attractive solution. A series of compact LNUs is developed, which provide significantly more functionality (such as transcendental functions) than other state-of-the-art designs. This allows, for example, to evaluate the atan2 function with three instructions for only 183.2 pJ/op at 0.8 V. We present the first shared-LNU architecture where these LNUs have been integrated into a multicore system with four 32-b-OpenRISC cores and show measurement results demonstrating that the shared-LNU design can be up to 4.1\u00d7 more energy-efficient in common nonlinear processing kernels, compared with a similar area design with four private FPUs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7756672/","volume":"52","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7756672/","accessionNumber":"16584869","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Extended Shared Logarithmic Unit for Nonlinear Function Kernel Acceleration in a 65-nm CMOS Multicore Cluster","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"FP7 ERC Advance Project MULTITHERMAN","grantNumber":"291125"},{"fundingName":"IcySoC Project, evaluated by the Swiss NSF and funded by Nano-Tera.ch with Swiss Confederation financing"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Extended Shared Logarithmic Unit for Nonlinear Function Kernel Acceleration in a 65-nm CMOS Multicore Cluster","sourcePdf":"jssc-gautschi-2626272-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133802S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"7811159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7811159","articleId":"7756672","onlineDate":"28 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7756676,"authors":[{"name":"Robert R.

In this work, we explore near-data processing for a fundamental operation - linked-list traversal (LLT). We propose a new NDP architecture that does not change the existing sequential programming model and does not require any modification to the processor microarchitecture. Instead, we exploit the packetized interface between the core and the memory modules to off-load LLT for NDP. We leverage a system with multiple memory modules (e.g., hybrid memory cube (HMC) modules) interconnected with a memory network and our initial evaluation shows that simply off-loading LLT computation to near-memory can actually reduce performance because of the additional off-chip memory network channel traversals. Thus, we first propose NDP-aware data localization to exploit locality - including locality within a single memory module and memory vault - to minimize latency and improve energy efficiency. In order to improve overall throughput and maximize parallelism, we propose batching multiple LLT operations together to amortize the cost of NDP by utilizing the highly parallel execution of NDP processing units and the high bandwidth of 3D stacked DRAM. The combination of NDP-aware data localization and batching can provide significant improvement in performance and energy efficiency compared to host-processing.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2967938.2967958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7756742","startPage":"113","endPage":"124","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Parallel Architecture and Compilation Techniques (PACT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750433/7756742/07756746.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating linked-list traversal through near-data processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7756746/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7756746/","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating linked-list traversal through near-data processing","conferenceDate":"11-15 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16505469","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating linked-list traversal through near-data processing","confLoc":"Haifa, Israel","sourcePdf":"p113-hong.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090362S","chronDate":"11-15 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750433","isNumber":"7756742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750433","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7756742","articleId":"7756746","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7756754,"authors":[{"name":"Younghyun Cho","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Younghyun","lastName":"Cho","id":"37085842621"},{"name":"Surim Oh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Surim","lastName":"Oh","id":"37086206461"},{"name":"Bernhard Egger","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Bernhard","lastName":"Egger","id":"37680232200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4121-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5308-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7756754","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7756754","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Scalability","Data models","Runtime","Adaptation models","Predictive models","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","multiprocessing systems","parallel programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online scalability characterization","data-parallel programs","many cores","online scalability prediction model","NUMA many-core systems","memory contention","program scalability","data parallelism","data dependencies","last-level caches","two-level queuing model","mean service time","scalability predictions","parallel applications","open-source OpenCL","GNU OpenMP runtime","64-core AMD system","parallel workloads","parallel configurations","data-parallel kernels"]}],"abstract":"We present an accurate online scalability prediction model for data-parallel programs on NUMA many-core systems. Memory contention is considered to be the major limiting factor of program scalability as data parallelism limits the amount of synchronization or data dependencies between parallel work units. Reflecting the architecture of NUMA systems, contention is modeled at the last-level caches of the compute nodes and the memory nodes using a two-level queuing model to estimate the mean service time of the individual memory nodes. Scalability predictions for individual or co-located parallel applications are based solely on data obtained during a short sampling period at runtime; this allows the presented model to be employed in a variety of scenarios. The proposed model has been implemented into an open-source OpenCL and the GNU OpenMP runtime and evaluated on a 64-core AMD system.

To make matters worse, DRAM bandwidth is increasing much slower than per CPU core count, while DRAM latency has been virtually stagnant. Parallel applications that are bound by memory bandwidth fail to scale, while applications bound by memory latency draw a small fraction of much-needed bandwidth. While expert programmers may be able to tune important applications by hand through heroic effort, traditional compiler cache optimizations have not been sufficiently aggressive to overcome the growing DRAM gap. In this paper, we introduce milk - a C/C++ language extension that allows programmers to annotate memory-bound loops concisely. Using optimized intermediate data structures, random indirect memory references are transformed into batches of efficient sequential DRAM accesses.

Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) architectures and applications, where main memory bandwidth is a critical bottleneck, can benefit from the use of PIM. To this end, an application should be properly partitioned and scheduled to execute on either the main, powerful GPU cores that are far away from memory or the auxiliary, simple GPU cores that are close to memory (e.g., in the logic layer of 3D-stacked DRAM). This paper investigates two key code scheduling issues in such a GPU architecture that has PIM capabilities, to maximize performance and energy-efficiency: (1) how to automatically identify the code segments, or kernels, to be offloaded to the cores in memory, and (2) how to concurrently schedule multiple kernels on the main GPU cores and the auxiliary GPU cores in memory. We develop two new runtime techniques: (1) a regression-based affinity prediction model and mechanism that accurately identifies which kernels would benefit from PIM and offloads them to GPU cores in memory, and (2) a concurrent kernel management mechanism that uses the affinity prediction model, a new kernel execution time prediction model, and kernel dependency information to decide which kernels to schedule concurrently on main GPU cores and the GPU cores in memory. Our experimental evaluations across 25 GPU applications demonstrate that these two techniques can significantly improve both application performance (by 25% and 42%, respectively, on average) and energy efficiency (by 28% and 27%).","doi":"10.1145/2967938.2967940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7756742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2967938.2967940","publicationTitle":"2016

the state-of-the-art accuracies of object recognition, which is the core function of a myriad of modern multimedia processing techniques such as image/video processing, speech recognition, and natural language processing. GPU-based accelerators gained increasing attention because a large amount of highly parallel neurons in CNN naturally matches the GPU computation pattern. In this work, we perform comprehensive experiments to investigate the performance bottlenecks and overheads of current GPU acceleration platform for scale-out CNN-based big data processing. In our characterization, we observe two significant semantic gaps: framework gap that lies between CNN-based data processing workflow and data processing manner in distributed framework; and the standalone gap that lies between the uneven computation loads at different CNN layers and fixed computing capacity provisioning of current GPU acceleration library. To bridge these gaps, we propose D\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\nNN, a Distributed, Decoupled, and Dynamically tuned GPU acceleration framework for modern CNN architectures.

An image processing pipeline can be viewed as a graph of interconnected stages that processes images successively. Each stage typically performs a point-wise, stencil, or other more complex operations on image pixels. Recent efforts have led to the development of domain-specific languages (DSL) and optimization frameworks for image processing pipelines. In this paper, we develop an approach to map image processing pipelines expressed in the PolyMage DSL to efficient parallel FPGA designs. Our approach exploits reuse and available memory bandwidth (or chip resources) maximally. When compared to Darkroom, a state-of-the-art approach to compile high-level DSL to FPGAs, our approach (a) leads to designs that deliver significantly higher throughput, and (b) supports a greater variety of filters. Furthermore, the designs we generate obtain an improvement even over pre-optimized FPGA implementations provided by vendor libraries for some of the benchmarks.","doi":"10.1145/2967938.2967969","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Parallel Architecture and Compilation Techniques (PACT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750433/7756742/07756767.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2967938.2967969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7756742","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Parallel Architecture and Compilation Techniques (PACT)","startPage":"327","endPage":"338","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A DSL compiler for accelerating image processing pipelines on FPGAs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7756767/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16505436","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7756767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Sept. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A DSL compiler for accelerating image processing pipelines on FPGAs","confLoc":"Haifa, Israel","sourcePdf":"p327-chugh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.136188S","chronDate":"11-15 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750433","isNumber":"7756742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750433","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7756742","articleId":"7756767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7756906,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Feng","affiliation":["Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Digital Education Equipment, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Feng","id":"37086180975"},{"name":"Linli Wu","affiliation":["Information Technology college Luoyang Normal University, Luoyang, Henan, China"],"firstName":"Linli","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086182124"},{"name":"Jian Wang","affiliation":["East China Normal Uniersity Press, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086182123"},{"name":"Hong Zhou","affiliation":["Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Digital Education Equipment, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086183419"},{"name":"Yonghe Wu","affiliation":["Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Digital Education Equipment, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yonghe","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086186570"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9041-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9042-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-377X"}],"articleNumber":"7756906","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tutorials","Web pages","Browsers","Software","Libraries","Patents","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided instruction","online front-ends","open systems","real-time systems","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["open flexible tutorial eco-system designing","Web application & services","online tutorial","e-learning","Web services","Web applications","open eco-system","real-time context","proof of concept","PoC","Web browser extensions","iMacro","greasemonkey","Web of Science site","academic paper searching"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["online tutorial","Eco-system","E-learning","iMacro","GreaseMonkey"]}],"abstract":"Online tutorial is a major topic in the e-learning field.

In order to analyze the local precise and global characters of all targets, we divide the broadband signal into several sub bands, and the STMV is carried out in both the sub bands and whole band in this paper. The optimal engineering realization way of broadband vector array STMV is proposed from the view of practical application point. By analyzing the spatial spectrums of sub bands and whole band signals, the weak targets detection and multi-target tracking capability of the vector STMV is enhanced significantly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7757135/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16520297","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","conferenceDate":"27-28 Aug. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7757135/","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Research of Vector Array STMV Beam-Forming Technology and Its Sea Trial Application","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research of Vector Array STMV Beam-Forming Technology and Its Sea Trial Application","confLoc":"ZhangJiaJie, China","sourcePdf":"4155a311.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060985S","chronDate":"27-28 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7754734","isNumber":"7757054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7754734","xplore-issue":"7757054","articleId":"7757135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7757379,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Ying Li","id":"37085352174"},{"name":"Jianwei Niu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jianwei Niu","id":"37276941100"},{"name":"Jiong Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jiong Zhang","id":"37085995460"},{"name":"Xin Ren","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xin Ren","id":"37085653434"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1790-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1791-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7757379","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":202},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Internet","Mobile communication","Information technology","Virtualization","Training","Collaboration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided instruction","educational courses","electronic engineering computing","electronic engineering education","field programmable gate arrays","Internet","teaching","virtual reality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information technology","online learning","teaching activities","theoretical courses","virtualization","experimental equipment","experimental course","multicore computing","field programmable gate array","network laboratory","experimental teaching","Internet","massive open online experiment","FPGA","virtual simulation experiment","online education mode","MOOE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MOOE","MOOC","Online","Experimental teaching","Visualization"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposed a new kind of online education mode, MOOE (Massive Open Online Experiment).

Within this scenario, a practical and dynamic learning system is being fostered that allows simulations to be carried out in real contexts through problem resolution. Based on constructivist theories, PBL (Problem-Based Learning) is a teaching method that is focused on the students and its main characteristic is that it uses real-world problems to create the learning content and teach the skills required for their solution. However, the adoption of this approach is not an easy task, since it is accompanied by abrupt changes in the traditional paradigm of education, which require changes in the attitudes of the actors involved. In addition, the planning and monitoring of the PBL, involve complex activities that are difficult to manage, especially with regard to determining the quality and compliance of the processes used for problem resolution. Additionally, the Computer Science courses require working on projects provided by real clients, within a dynamic and iterative development process. This strengthens the need to introduce strategies and technologies to support the implementation and management of the method and, enable its effectiveness to be monitored In addition, it provides continuous feedback, and assesses the results generated from the evaluation of the solutions produced during the teaching-learning process. Thus, it is essential to adopt strategies that allow a better management of teaching practice, improved learning by the students and a means of validating the clients involved. From this perspective, this paper presents a virtual teaching and learning environment, called PBLMaestro, which has been designed to support the workflow of a methodology for the implementation of PBL in teaching Computer Science, called xPBL. With the aid of xPBL, it is possible to perform the management of courses using the dynamics of a cycle and series of stages to allow a better control of management processes, by linking real problems to well-defined educational goals. In the case of teacher planning, we were used elements described in xPBL methodology, aligned with educational goals defined from the Bloom Revised Taxonomy. With regard to student tracking, we used the authentic assessment model and mechanisms of Learning Analytics. Gamification strategies were included to increase engagement, retention and motivation, and push notification messages were displayed in a mobile application the PBLMaestro was validated by means of application the environment in the context of the discipline \u201cNetwork Design\u201d of Computer Science Course, and the results are analyzed in this study. In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the teachers and there was a high degree of satisfaction among the tutors, students and customers who used the service, with regard to the usability and consistency of the proposed environment as well as with its improvements and changes. Although the environment was improved in the area of computer science, it is possible that it can provide support to the STEM context with some customizations.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7757333","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7749394/7757333/07757388.pdf","doi":"10.1109/FIE.2016.7757388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2016.7757388","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PBLMaestro: A virtual learning environment for the implementation of problem-based learning approach in Computer education","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7757388/","displayDocTitle":"PBLMaestro: A virtual learning environment for the implementation of problem-based learning approach in Computer education","htmlLink":"/document/7757388/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16505006","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PBLMaestro: A virtual learning environment for the implementation of problem-based learning approach in Computer education","confLoc":"Erie, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"1570250944.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059908S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7749394","isNumber":"7757333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7749394","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7757333","articleId":"7757388","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7757534,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos N.

This approach uses currently available and free tools in this new application. Co-occurrence networks are a method for visualizing relationships between concepts within written material. The results of a co-occurrence analysis are a network that reflects the relationships between words based on meaning similarities among words and text segments. To illustrate this approach, I applied the methodology of a systematic literature review search that resulted in 391 unique journal articles, books, and reports on identity published in the period from 1995 to 2015. The abstracts, titles, and keywords of these journals were analyzed via linguistic analysis to create a word co-occurrence network of these articles related to identity in science and engineering. Clusters within this network were identified based on word frequency. The results of this research illustrate a hole in the current identity literature in understanding diversity beyond traditional definitions of race, class, and gender. This method has the potential to powerfully convey and embed information about large amounts of data in a single image and offers a new way to report findings from a systematic literature review.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7757333","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7749394/7757333/07757690.pdf","doi":"10.1109/FIE.2016.7757690","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2016.7757690","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visualizing systematic literature reviews to identify new areas of research","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7757690/","displayDocTitle":"Visualizing systematic literature reviews to identify new areas of research","htmlLink":"/document/7757690/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16504888","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visualizing systematic literature reviews to identify new areas of research","confLoc":"Erie, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"1570250411.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082241S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7749394","isNumber":"7757333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7749394","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7757333","articleId":"7757690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7757806,"authors":[{"name":"Shiyang Tao","affiliation":["Beijing Electric Power Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Shiyang Tao","id":"37086010707"},{"name":"Wenshan Wang","affiliation":["Beijing Electric Power Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wenshan Wang","id":"37086015160"},{"name":"Zhigang Ren","affiliation":["Beijing Electric Power Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhigang Ren","id":"37085878351"},{"name":"Xu Cheng","affiliation":["Beijing Electric Power Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xu Cheng","id":"37086010732"},{"name":"Wei Li","affiliation":["Beijing Electric Power Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wei Li","id":"37086162677"},{"name":"Linlin Wu","affiliation":["Beijing Electric Power Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Linlin Wu","id":"37086161290"},{"name":"Tianchen Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing Electric Power Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Tianchen Zhang","id":"37086016399"},{"name":"Dapeng Duan","affiliation":["Beijing Electric Power Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Dapeng Duan","id":"37529997400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3398-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3397-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3399-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7757806","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Rubber"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","switchgear"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UHF signals propagation characteristics","medium voltage switchgear","FDTD methods","PD electromagnetic signal attenuation","electromagnetic waves","PD characteristics","UHF signals propagation","switchgear gaps","finite difference time domain method","modeling analysis","attenuation characteristics","electromagnetic waves pass"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["switchgear","partial discharge(PD)","FDTD","UHF electromagnetic waves","attenuation characteristics"]}],"abstract":"PD electromagnetic signal attenuation occurs when electromagnetic waves pass through a switchgear gap and propagate outward.

Therefore the performance is not stable. Recent progress in deep neural networks, which contain more than one hidden layer, has shown state-of-art performance in speech recognition, image classification and natural language processing. Besides, the deep neural networks have the ability to handle large dataset, which is the technique for the future as more and more condition monitoring data accumulate. In this paper, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with deep architecture is established to extrapolate new features automatically to realize ultra-high frequency (UHF) signals recognition in GIS. Firstly, a two-dimension spectral frames representation of the UHF signals is obtained by the time-frequency analysis. Then the spectral frames are used to train a deep CNN. It is shown that the proposed method can identify different sources of PD successfully. A comparison with other PD pattern recognition techniques is also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/CMD.2016.7757816","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Condition Monitoring and Diagnosis (CMD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Condition Monitoring and Diagnosis (CMD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7749537/7757751/07757816.pdf","startPage":"324","endPage":"327","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMD.2016.7757816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7757751","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7757816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial discharge patterns recognition with deep Convolutional Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7757816/","displayDocTitle":"Partial discharge patterns recognition with deep Convolutional Neural Networks","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7757816/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16505247","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial discharge patterns recognition with deep Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"D3-5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065163S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7749537","isNumber":"7757751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7749537","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7757751","articleId":"7757816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":7757897,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In reality, not every reviews available online are helpful to users, so the need for filtering unqualified reviews is realized. There have been several studies on spam review detection that attempt to detect unqualified reviews using n-gram linguistic features. They attempted to classify reviews written in English into two categories: filtered and unfiltered reviews. In our paper, we are aware that filtered reviews can be categorized further into advertisements, complaints, and non-review opinions. Each type of filtered reviews requires different actions be taken on them. For instance, advertisements should be deleted while the others should be hidden. This paper proposes a framework for unqualified restaurant reviews detection using SVM. The data set of restaurant reviews is provided by a web portal for restaurants in Thailand. There are three main processes in our framework: (1) filtering obvious spam, (2) data pre-processing, and (3) classification using SVM. We find that the procedures in our framework can improve classification accuracy compared with standard frameworks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Eighth International Conference on Knowledge and Systems Engineering (KSE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7749393/7758010/07758039.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"120","publicationTitle":"2016 Eighth International Conference on Knowledge and Systems Engineering (KSE)","doi":"10.1109/KSE.2016.7758039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/KSE.2016.7758039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758010","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7758039","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A framework to detect unqualified restaurant reviews","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Filtering","Feature extraction","Internet","Noise measurement","Data models","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["catering industry","decision making","Internet","linguistics","pattern classification","portals","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unqualified restaurant review detection","user-generated restaurant reviews","Internet","decision making","unqualified review filtering","spam review detection","n-gram linguistic features","English","nonreview opinions","SVM","restaurant review data set","Web portal","data pre-processing","classification accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiclass classification","opinion mining","one-vs-one","one-vs-all","support vector machine","text classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7758039/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A framework to detect unqualified restaurant reviews","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7758039/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16504750","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A framework to detect unqualified restaurant reviews","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"20_paper25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072934S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7749393","isNumber":"7758010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7749393","xplore-issue":"7758010","articleId":"7758039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7758066,"authors":[{"name":"Viet-Trung Tran","affiliation":["Hanoi University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Viet-Trung","lastName":"Tran","id":"37089128100"},{"name":"Kiem-Hieu Nguyen","affiliation":["Hanoi University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Kiem-Hieu","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37086143300"},{"name":"Duc-Hanh Bui","affiliation":["Hanoi University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Duc-Hanh","lastName":"Bui","id":"37086144678"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8929-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8930-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7758066","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":209},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Context","Motion pictures","Recurrent neural networks","Training","Context modeling","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural language processing","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Vietnamese language model","natural language processing tasks","NLP","statistical language models","natural language model","RNN-based language models","recurrent neural network language model","movie subtitle dataset"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7758066","abstract":"Language modeling plays a critical role in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as text prediction, machine translation and speech recognition.

The method computes pixel-wise probabilities and combines them to find a coherent object segmentation. It reliably segments objects in cluttered scenarios, even when objects are translucent, reflective, highly deformable, have fuzzy surfaces, or consist of loosely coupled components. The robust performance results from the exploitation of problem structure inherent to the warehouse setting.

Performance tests with the joint actuators indicated a torque control bandwidth of more than 70 Hz, high disturbance rejection capability, as well as impact robustness when moving with maximal velocity. It is demonstrated in a series of experiments that ANYmal can execute walking gaits, dynamically trot at moderate speed, and is able to perform special maneuvers to stand up or crawl very steep stairs.

However, current structure reconstruction and segmentation approaches suffer from either exclusion of small structures or strong dependence on a-priori knowledge. We propose reconstruction methods based on compressed sensing (CS) denoising in combination with the isodata threshold for segmentation. The methods are verified on artificial test data. For the denoising, a Haar dictionary and a KSVD dictionary learning on artificial data are used. Both methods perform significantly better than the reference algorithm, a linear density filter, in terms of root-mean-square deviation from the ground truth. Furthermore, exemplary results on real LM data of irradiated cell nuclei with Heterochromatin labeling make small structures visible that are suppressed by the reference method. CS denoising demonstrates promising results for reconstruction of LM data.","doi":"10.1109/CIBCB.2016.7758097","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CIBCB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CIBCB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750373/7758093/07758097.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIBCB.2016.7758097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing denoising for segmentation of localization microscopy data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7758097","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7758097/","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing denoising for segmentation of localization microscopy data","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16579025","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7758097/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing denoising for segmentation of localization microscopy data","confLoc":"Chiang Mai, Thailand","sourcePdf":"CIBCB2016_Camera_Ready_14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075671S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750373","isNumber":"7758093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750373","xplore-issue":"7758093","articleId":"7758097","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7758099,"authors":[{"name":"Tatiana Polushina","affiliation":["Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway"],"firstName":"Tatiana","lastName":"Polushina","id":"37713637600"},{"name":"Georgy Sofronov","affiliation":["Department of Statistics Faculty of Science and Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Georgy","lastName":"Sofronov","id":"37713637300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9472-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0012-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7758099","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DNA","Biological system modeling","Hidden Markov models","Probability density function","Markov processes","Mathematical model","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","biological techniques","DNA","genomics","molecular biophysics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-entropy method","change-point detection","four-letter DNA sequences","genome domains","bioinformatics research","multiple change-point model","biomolecular sequences"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["change-point problem","Cross-Entropy method","combinatorial optimization","DNA sequence"]}],"abstract":"It is well-known that many genomes are highly structured.

The results obtained with these PLANN-ARD/PLANN-CR-ARD models are compared with the results obtained with a different set of Bayesian Neural Networks namely the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods [19, 20]. This work is done in the recent context of evaluation of large number of classification models [25] on medical dataset(s) and more specifically in the context of evaluation of different types of Bayesian Neural Networks [23, 26-29] in the medical survival analysis domain. There is such an interest in studying various classification and regression models for outcome prediction in medical survival analysis. Two medical datasets are used herein: a node negative breast cancer dataset (SR analysis) and a Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) dataset (CR analysis). The PLANN-ARD/PLANN-CR-ARD models form a group of two neural network models which are based on gradient type of optimization algorithms for the calculus of the neural network parameters. The MCMC sampling methods represent another set of models which are used in this paper for SR study (MCMC-SR algorithm) and CR study (MCMC-CR algorithm) in medical survival domain. The MCMC sampling methods are implemented by a MCMC toolbox available in the literature [10, 11, 19-21]. The MCMC methods are sampling from the prior probability distributions of the model parameters and they include the Gibbs sampler, the Metropolis-Hastings sampler, the Hybrid Markov Chain Monte Carlo (HMCMC) sampler or the Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) sampler. The results obtained by the four BNNs are compared with the non-parametric estimates obtained through the survival study of the two medical datasets from above. The results show a superiority of the PLANN-ARD/PLANN-CR-ARD models with regard to the MCMC-SR/MCMC-CR algorithms from the point of view of the model selection task which was less computational expensive for the PLANN-ARD/PLANN-CR-ARD models.","doi":"10.1109/CIBCB.2016.7758122","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CIBCB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750373/7758093/07758122.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CIBCB)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIBCB.2016.7758122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial Logistic Artificial Neural Network with automatic relevance determination and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods applied in medical survival studies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logistics","Markov processes","Monte Carlo methods","Artificial neural networks","Sampling methods","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancer","Markov processes","medical computing","Monte Carlo methods","neural nets","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler","hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler","Metropolis-Hastings sampler","Gibbs sampler","probability distributions","MCMC toolbox","MCMC sampling methods","optimization algorithms","primary biliary cirrhosis dataset","node negative breast cancer dataset","regression models","medical dataset","classification models","competing risk","single risk","Bayesian neural networks","medical survival studies","Markov chain Monte Carlo methods","automatic relevance determination","partial logistic artificial neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7758122/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Partial Logistic Artificial Neural Network with automatic relevance determination and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods applied in medical survival studies","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7758122/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2017","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16562971","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial Logistic Artificial Neural Network with automatic relevance determination and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods applied in medical survival studies","confLoc":"Chiang Mai, Thailand","sourcePdf":"CIBCB2016_Camera_Ready_59.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068275S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750373","isNumber":"7758093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750373","xplore-issue":"7758093","articleId":"7758122","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7758202,"authors":[{"name":"Ryan C.

In this system, a droplet (1.25\u03bcL) consisting of a mixture of functionalized microbeads and analyte is flowed through a 0.51mm internal diameter silicone tube. Hydrodynamic forces alone produce a very efficient mixing of the beads within the droplet. We tested the agglutination at different speeds and show a robust response at the higher range of speeds (150 - 200\u03bcL/min), while also reaching a completion in the agglutination process. At these velocities, a length of 180cm is shown to be sufficient to confidently measure the agglutination assay, which takes between 2.5 - 3 minutes. This high throughput quantification method has the potential of accelerating the measurements of various types of biomarkers, which can greatly benefit the fields of biology and medicine.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of the incubation of microbead agglutination assays in a microfluidic system","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 11th Annual International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems (NEMS)","doi":"10.1109/NEMS.2016.7758266","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 11th Annual International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems (NEMS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750493/7758182/07758266.pdf","startPage":"354","endPage":"357","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEMS.2016.7758266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758182","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7758266","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7758266/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2016","displayDocTitle":"A study of the incubation of microbead agglutination assays in a microfluidic system","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7758266/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"16505569","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of the incubation of microbead agglutination assays in a microfluidic system","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"B3P-B-26_1314.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061264S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750493","isNumber":"7758182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750493","xplore-issue":"7758182","articleId":"7758266","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7758267,"authors":[{"name":"David Conchouso","affiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, SA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Conchouso"},{"name":"Arpys Arevalo","affiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Arpys","lastName":"Arevalo","id":"37061177700"},{"name":"Garret McKerricher","affiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Garret","lastName":"McKerricher","id":"37085414919"},{"name":"David Castro","affiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Castro","id":"37862255000"},{"name":"Ian G.

The T-resonator works as a feedback system to monitor uniform droplet production and to detect, in real-time, any malfunctions due to channel fouling or clogging. Emulsions at different W/O flow-rate ratios are generated in a microfluidic device containing 8 parallelized generators. These emulsions are then guided towards the RF sensor, which is then read using a Network Analyzer to obtain the frequency response of the system. The proposed T-resonator shows frequency shifts of 45MHz for only 5% change in the emulsion's water in oil content. These shifts can then be used as a feedback system to trigger alarms and notify production and quality control engineers about problems in the droplet generation process.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 11th Annual International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems (NEMS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750493/7758182/07758267.pdf","startPage":"358","endPage":"361","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 11th Annual International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems (NEMS)","doi":"10.1109/NEMS.2016.7758267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEMS.2016.7758267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758182","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7758267","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radio frequency feedback method for parallelized droplet microfluidics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Generators","Production","Monitoring","Permittivity","Radio frequency","Oils","Resonant frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["drops","emulsions","flow sensors","microchannel flow","microstrip resonators","network analysers","oils","two-phase flow","water"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["droplet generation process","emulsion water in oil content","system frequency response","network analyzer","RF sensor","parallelized generator","microfluidic device","W/O flow-rate ratio","channel clogging","channel fouling","uniform droplet production","feedback system","parallel droplet microfluidic system","radiofrequency microstrip T-resonator","parallelized droplet microfluidics","radiofrequency feedback method","frequency 45 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7758267/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2016","displayDocTitle":"Radio frequency feedback method for parallelized droplet microfluidics","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7758267/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"16517809","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio frequency feedback method for parallelized droplet microfluidics","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"B3P-B-27_1325.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073962S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750493","isNumber":"7758182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750493","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7758182","articleId":"7758267","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7758351,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas W.

Such observations will enable improvement in cloud and moisture simulations in global climate models as well as precipitation forecasts on a global basis. Measurements at a range of frequencies in the millimeter- and submillimeter-wave frequency range provide sensitivity to ice particle size distribution in the range of tens to hundreds of micrometers. To perform this measurement on a global basis, a new millimeter- and submillimeter-wave instrument is currently under development with suitable mass, power and volume to be deployed on 6U-Class nanosatellites. To achieve miniaturized receivers in this frequency range, InP MMIC technology has been scaled to 25-nm gate length transistors, enabling demonstration of low-noise amplifiers with sufficient gain at frequencies up to 1 THz. This technology is being applied to develop direct-detection submillimeter-wave receivers at 240 GHz, 310 GHz and 670 GHz. InP MMIC technology has also enabled multipliers for local oscillators and subharmonic mixers for temperature and humidity sounding channels near atmospheric absorption lines at 118.75, 183.31 and 380.20 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/IRMMW-THz.2016.7758396","publicationTitle":"2016 41st International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz waves (IRMMW-THz)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 41st International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz waves (IRMMW-THz)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7707293/7758325/07758396.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRMMW-THz.2016.7758396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758325","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tropospheric water and cloud ICE (TWICE) millimeter and submillimeter-wave radiometer instrument for 6U-Class nanosatellites","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7758396","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7758396/","displayDocTitle":"Tropospheric water and cloud ICE (TWICE) millimeter and submillimeter-wave radiometer instrument for 6U-Class nanosatellites","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16502705","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7758396/","conferenceDate":"25-30 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tropospheric water and cloud ICE (TWICE) millimeter and submillimeter-wave radiometer instrument for 6U-Class nanosatellites","confLoc":"Copenhagen, Denmark","sourcePdf":"H3A4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065771S","chronDate":"25-30 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7707293","isNumber":"7758325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7707293","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7758325","articleId":"7758396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7758532,"authors":[{"name":"Arya Fallahi","affiliation":["DESY, Center for Free-Electron Laser Science, Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Arya","lastName":"Fallahi","id":"37543527500"},{"name":"Alireza Yahaghi","affiliation":["Department of Communication and Electronics Engineering, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran","DESY, Center for Free-Electron Laser Science, Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Yahaghi","id":"37545761600"},{"name":"Franz X.

Due to the low wall-plug efficiency of FEL facilities compared to lasers and other radiation sources, it is crucial and additionally very useful to develop complete simulation tools capable of accurately simulating a FEL process. The highly sophisticated dynamics involved in a FEL process was the main obstacle hindering the development of a general simulation tool for this problem. We present a numerical algorithm based on FDTD/PIC in a Lorentz boosted coordinate system which is able to completely simulate the FEL process. The developed software offers a suitable tool for the analysis of the FEL interaction without considering any of the usual approximations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full-wave numerical modeling of an infrared free electron laser using FDTD/PIC","publicationTitle":"2016 41st International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz waves (IRMMW-THz)","doi":"10.1109/IRMMW-THz.2016.7758532","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 41st International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz waves (IRMMW-THz)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7707293/7758325/07758532.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRMMW-THz.2016.7758532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758325","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7758532","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7758532/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Full-wave numerical modeling of an infrared free electron laser using FDTD/PIC","conferenceDate":"25-30 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7758532/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16502745","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-wave numerical modeling of an infrared free electron laser using FDTD/PIC","confLoc":"Copenhagen, Denmark","sourcePdf":"H5P2203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038745S","chronDate":"25-30 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7707293","isNumber":"7758325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7707293","xplore-issue":"7758325","articleId":"7758532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7758639,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Gao","affiliation":["CSIRO Manufacturing, Lindfield, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Gao","id":"37086107140"},{"name":"Jia Du","affiliation":["CSIRO Manufacturing, Lindfield, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Du","id":"37305139300"},{"name":"Andrew R.

This problem is relevant for a resource-constrained robot that has to navigate and map an environment, but does not have enough on-board power or payload to carry a traditional depth sensor (e.g., a 3D lidar) and can only acquire few (point-wise) depth measurements. In general, reconstruction from incomplete data is not possible, but when the robot operates in man-made environments, the depth exhibits some regularity (e.g., many planar surfaces with few edges); we leverage this regularity to infer depth from incomplete measurements. Our formulation bridges robotic perception with the compressive sensing literature in signal processing. We exploit this connection to provide formal results on exact depth recovery in 2D and 3D problems. Taking advantage of our specific sensing modality, we also prove novel and more powerful results to completely characterize the geometry of the signals that we can reconstruct. Our results directly translate to practical algorithms for depth reconstruction; these algorithms are simple (they reduce to solving a linear program), and robust to noise. We test our algorithms on real and simulated data, and show that they enable accurate depth reconstruction from a handful of measurements, and perform well even when the assumption of structured environment is violated.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759040","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759040.pdf","startPage":"96","endPage":"103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse sensing for resource-constrained depth reconstruction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759040","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759040/","displayDocTitle":"Sparse sensing for resource-constrained depth reconstruction","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503759","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759040/","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse sensing for resource-constrained depth reconstruction","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0256.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081494S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759040","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":7759052,"authors":[{"name":"Erik Berger","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, Technical University Bergakademie Freiberg, Freiberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Berger","id":"37085365368"},{"name":"David Vogt","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, Technical University Bergakademie Freiberg, Freiberg, Germany"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Vogt","id":"37085355130"},{"name":"Steve Grehl","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, Technical University Bergakademie Freiberg, Freiberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Grehl","id":"37085801323"},{"name":"Bernhard Jung","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, Technical University Bergakademie Freiberg, Freiberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernhard","lastName":"Jung","id":"37289795700"},{"name":"Heni Ben Amor","affiliation":["School of Computing, Informatics and, Decision Systems Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Heni","lastName":"Ben Amor","id":"37665302300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3761-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"7759052","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":272},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759052","abstract":"In order to ensure safe operation, robots must be able to reliably detect behavior perturbations that result from unexpected physical interactions with their environment and human co-workers. While some robots provide firmware force sensors that generate rough force estimates, more accurate force measurements are usually achieved with dedicated force-torque sensors. However, such sensors are often heavy, expensive and require an additional power supply. In the case of lightweight manipulators, the already limited payload capabilities may be reduced in a significant way. This paper presents an experience-based approach for accurately estimating external forces being applied to a robot without the need for a force-torque sensor. Using Information Transfer, a subset of sensors relevant to the executed behavior are identified from a larger set of internal sensors. Models mapping robot sensor data to force-torque measurements are learned using a neural network. These models can be used to predict the magnitude and direction of perturbations from affordable, proprioceptive sensors only. Experiments with a UR5 robot show that our method yields force estimates with accuracy comparable to a dedicated force-torque sensor. Moreover, our method yields a substantial improvement in accuracy over force-torque values provided by the robot firmware.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759052","startPage":"176","endPage":"181","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759052.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimating perturbations from experience using neural networks and Information Transfer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Force","Force measurement","Feature extraction","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["force control","force sensors","learning systems","manipulators","mechanoception","neurocontrollers","perturbation techniques","torque control","torque measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["perturbation estimation","neural network","information transfer","robotsafe operation","behavior perturbation detection","unexpected physical interaction","human coworkers","firmware force sensor","rough force estimate","force measurement","force-torque sensor","lightweight manipulator","limited payload capability","external force estimation","internal sensors","robot sensor data","force-torque measurement","learning","perturbation magnitude","perturbation direction","proprioceptive sensor","UR5 robot"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759052/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Estimating perturbations from experience using neural networks and Information Transfer","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759052/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503921","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating perturbations from experience using neural networks and Information Transfer","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062732S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759052","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7759059,"authors":[{"name":"Yukyung Choi","affiliation":["Dep. of EE, Robotics and Computer Vision (RCV) Laboratory, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Yukyung","lastName":"Choi","id":"37085621229"},{"name":"Namil Kim","affiliation":["Dep. of EE, Robotics and Computer Vision (RCV) Laboratory, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Namil","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085628320"},{"name":"Soonmin Hwang","affiliation":["Dep. of EE, Robotics and Computer Vision (RCV) Laboratory, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Soonmin","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37085610793"},{"name":"In So Kweon","affiliation":["Dep. of EE, Robotics and Computer Vision (RCV) Laboratory, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"In So","lastName":"Kweon","id":"37270474800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3761-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"7759059","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2456},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image enhancement","Cameras","Image resolution","Training","Feature extraction","Image reconstruction","Robot vision systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobiles","image recognition","infrared imaging","neural nets","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal image enhancement","convolutional neural network","commodity autonomous mobiles","illumination conditions","multimodal sensors","thermal camera","background clutters","image recognition","end-to-end mapping","image resolution","object recognition","pedestrian detection","visual odometry","image registration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Thermal camera","Image enhancement","Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)","Object Recognition","Visibility","Multi-modal"]}],"abstract":"With the advent of commodity autonomous mobiles, it is becoming increasingly prevalent to recognize under extreme conditions such as night, erratic illumination conditions.

To mitigate this, we aim to enhance the low-resolution thermal image according to the extensive analysis of existing approaches. To this end, we introduce Thermal Image Enhancement using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), called in TEN, which directly learns an end-to-end mapping a single low resolution image to the desired high resolution image. In addition, we examine various image domains to find the best representative of the thermal enhancement. Overall, we propose the first thermal image enhancement method based on CNN guided on RGB data. We provide extensive experiments designed to evaluate the quality of image and the performance of several object recognition tasks such as pedestrian detection, visual odometry, and image registration.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759059","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759059.pdf","startPage":"223","endPage":"230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal Image Enhancement using Convolutional Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759059/","displayDocTitle":"Thermal Image Enhancement using Convolutional Neural Network","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759059/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503487","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal Image Enhancement using Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1585.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080703S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7759075,"authors":[{"name":"James Higgins","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Higgins","id":"37086204393"},{"name":"Carrick Detweiler","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA"],"firstName":"Carrick","lastName":"Detweiler","id":"38535355300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3761-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"7759075","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"abstract":"Monitoring and predicting water quality poses significant challenges. Collecting enough information to characterize bodies of water is a critical bottleneck. Collecting data and samples from the surface all the way to the bottom over a short period of time would give water scientists the best spatio-temporal picture. In this paper, we present a small, light-weight, inexpensive water sensing and sampling robot, the \u201cWaterbug\u201d, capable of descending to depths up to 10m, collecting sensor information and a water sample, and returning to the surface. The water sampler also has limited capability to adjust buoyancy to hold depth for the purpose of measuring environmental conditions at specific locations in the water column. It is small enough that a single scientist could carry several in a backpack or it could be deployed by other robotic systems. The low cost of the node makes it feasible for blanket deployment. No tools are required for field servicing and the sample collection chamber is a common syringe that can be swapped quickly for redeployment. The main challenge was developing the system model and algorithm for achieving neutral buoyancy in the presence of system and initial condition variance. Over a range of conditions, we were able to achieve an 80% success rate for meeting the neutral buoyancy criteria and a 100% success rate in capturing a sample and returning to the surface.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Buoyancy","Temperature sensors","Monitoring","Solenoids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous underwater vehicles","buoyancy","marine control","mobile robots","water quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Waterbug subsurface sampler","system design","system control","system analysis","water quality","water sensing robot","water sampling robot","neutral buoyancy","underwater environment monitoring"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759075","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759075.pdf","startPage":"330","endPage":"337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The waterbug sub-surface sampler: Design, control and analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759075","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The waterbug sub-surface sampler: Design, control and analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759075/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759075/","accessionNumber":"16503728","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The waterbug sub-surface sampler: Design, control and analysis","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0759.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072892S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7759093,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Scheggi","affiliation":["Department of Biomechanical Engineering, University of Twente, NB, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Scheggi","id":"37546486300"},{"name":"ChangKyu Yoon","affiliation":["Department of Materials Science and Engineering, The Johns Hopkins University, MD, USA"],"firstName":"ChangKyu","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37076482200"},{"name":"David H.

Recently, miniaturized agents with shape-changing and gripping capabilities have provided significant advantages in performing grasping, transportation, and manipulation tasks. In order to robustly perform such tasks, it is of utmost importance to properly estimate their overall configuration. This paper presents a novel solution to the problem of estimating and tracking the 3D position, orientation and configuration of the tips of miniaturized grippers from RGB marker-less visual observations obtained by a microscope. We consider this as an optimization problem, seeking for the gripper model parameters that minimize the discrepancy between hypothesized instances of the gripper model and actual observations of the miniaturized gripper. This optimization problem is solved using a variant of the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. The proposed approach has been evaluated on several image sequences showing the grippers moving, rotating, opening/closing and grasping biological material.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759093/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16503706","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759093/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Model-based tracking of miniaturized grippers using Particle Swarm Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-based tracking of miniaturized grippers using Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.169276S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759093","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7759104,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Wolf","affiliation":["DLR - German Aerospace Center, Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Wolf","id":"37546936800"},{"name":"Jan-Emmo Feenders","affiliation":["DLR - German Aerospace Center, Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Jan-Emmo","lastName":"Feenders","id":"37086201794"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3761-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"7759104","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":389},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Friction","Mathematical model","Force","Gears","Actuators","Load modeling","Robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","energy conservation","friction","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficiency","variable stiffness actuators","DLR FSJ","DLR floating spring joint","robots","energy losses","full actuator dynamics","electromechanical transformation","bearing friction","gear friction","stiction","Coulomb friction","viscous friction","load dependent effects"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759104","abstract":"Robots with Variable Stiffness Actuators (VSA) are intrinsically flexible in the joints.

We propose two new representations of grasp candidates, and we quantify the effect of using prior knowledge of two forms: instance or category knowledge of the object to be grasped, and pretraining the network on simulated depth data obtained from idealized CAD models. Our analysis shows that a more informative grasp candidate representation as well as pretraining and prior knowledge significantly improve grasp detection.

While promising results have been recently achieved, robust and reliable controllers are still a challenge for the control community dealing with humanoid robotics. Momentum-based strategies have proven their effectiveness for controlling humanoids balancing, but the stability analysis of these controllers is still missing. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we numerically show that the application of state-of-the-art momentum-based control strategies may lead to unstable zero dynamics. Secondly, we propose simple modifications to the control architecture that avoid instabilities at the zero-dynamics level. Asymptotic stability of the closed loop system is shown by means of a Lyapunov analysis on the linearized system's joint space. The theoretical results are validated with both simulations and experiments on the iCub humanoid robot.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759126","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759126.pdf","startPage":"680","endPage":"687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability analysis and design of momentum-based controllers for humanoid robots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stability analysis and design of momentum-based controllers for humanoid robots","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16503824","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759126/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759126/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability analysis and design of momentum-based controllers for humanoid robots","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.137515S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759126","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-29"},{"_id":7759127,"authors":[{"name":"Mattia Racca","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Finland"],"firstName":"Mattia","lastName":"Racca","id":"37086198671"},{"name":"Joni Pajarinen","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Finland"],"firstName":"Joni","lastName":"Pajarinen","id":"37398592200"},{"name":"Alberto Montebelli","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Sk\u00f6vde, Sweden"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Montebelli","id":"37085564025"},{"name":"Ville Kyrki","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Finland"],"firstName":"Ville","lastName":"Kyrki","id":"37274001900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3761-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"7759127","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":621},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force","Robot sensing systems","Hidden Markov models","Impedance","Education","Trajectory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dexterous manipulators","elastic constants","force sensors","hidden Markov models","intelligent robots","manipulator kinematics","torque measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning in-contact control strategy-from-demonstration","context specificity","pose requirements","human kinesthetic demonstrations","hidden semiMarkov model","HSMM","Cartesian impedance control","task position constraints","task force constraint","online modulation","impedance controller stiffness","HSMM state belief","KUKA LWR 4+ robotic arm","force sensor","torque sensor"]}],"abstract":"Learning to perform tasks like pulling a door handle or pushing a button, inherently easy for a human, can be surprisingly difficult for a robot. A crucial problem in these kinds of in-contact tasks is the context specificity of pose and force requirements. In this paper, a robot learns in-contact tasks from human kinesthetic demonstrations. To address the need to balance between the position and force constraints, we propose a model based on the hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) and Cartesian impedance control. The model captures uncertainty over time and space and allows the robot to smoothly satisfy a task's position and force constraints by online modulation of impedance controller stiffness according to the HSMM state belief. In experiments, a KUKA LWR 4+ robotic arm equipped with a force/torque sensor at the wrist successfully learns from human demonstrations how to pull a door handle and push a button.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning in-contact control strategies from demonstration","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759127","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759127.pdf","startPage":"688","endPage":"695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759127","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759127/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Learning in-contact control strategies from demonstration","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759127/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503950","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning in-contact control strategies from demonstration","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066418S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759127","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":7759140,"authors":[{"name":"Lorenzo Saccares","affiliation":["Department of Advanced Robotics, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Italy"],"firstName":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Saccares","id":"37086131099"},{"name":"Ioannis Sarakoglou","affiliation":["Department of Advanced Robotics, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Italy"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Sarakoglou","id":"38530135100"},{"name":"Nikos G.

The specific kinematics features employed by iT-Knee can accommodate not only the translational of the knee instantaneous center of rotation in the sagittal plane and on its orthogonal direction, but also the knee varus/valgus angle as well as the internal/external rotation tibia movements delivering pure torque only around the flexion/extension movement. This functionality results in superior transparency and comfortability which allow prolonged period of use without generating significant discomfort. The iT-Knee kinematics, its mechanism, implementation, and actuation are introduced. The Self-aligning feature combined with a fast lock/release mounting system on the human leg shortens the setup time required to wear it, increasing its user-friendly perception. iT-Knee uses a torque controlled actuation unit to generate torque around the knee flexion extension enabling the implementation of several interaction control schemes that combine assistive functionality on demand with high back drivability and transparency during unloaded free motions of the human knee. Experimental results are presented and effectively demonstrate the functionality of the iT-Knee device.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759140.pdf","startPage":"780","endPage":"786","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"iT-Knee: An exoskeleton with ideal torque transmission interface for ergonomic power augmentation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Knee","Exoskeletons","Torque","Kinematics","Legged locomotion","Couplings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handicapped aids","medical robotics","patient rehabilitation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["torque controlled actuation unit","knee flexion extension","unloaded free motions","human knee","user-friendly perception","release mounting system","self-aligning feature","iT-Knee kinematics","exoskeleton device","rehabilitation tool","knee articulation","torque transmission interface","modular knee exoskeleton","ergonomic power augmentation","ideal torque transmission interface"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759140/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"iT-Knee: An exoskeleton with ideal torque transmission interface for ergonomic power augmentation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759140/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16504147","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"iT-Knee: An exoskeleton with ideal torque transmission interface for ergonomic power augmentation","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0966.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113432S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759140","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7759181,"authors":[{"name":"Shintaro Yamada","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shintaro","lastName":"Yamada","id":"37086206978"},{"name":"Shigeo Hirose","affiliation":["HiBot Corp., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeo","lastName":"Hirose","id":"37273278900"},{"name":"Gen Endo","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Gen","lastName":"Endo","id":"37282128000"},{"name":"Koichi Suzumori","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Koichi","lastName":"Suzumori","id":"37283170500"},{"name":"Hiroyuki Nabae","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Nabae","id":"37085590608"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3761-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"7759181","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":421},"abstract":"An amphibious all terrain mobile robot is required for disaster response tasks.

These links achieve high terrain adaptability while maintaining simple structure of the wheeled robot. We developed a prototype model and carried out basic experiments. The robot achieved to climb 0.3 m of a step(76.9% of the wheel diameter), stairs and a snowy slope. In addition, we propose amphibious structure of crank links by installing multiple rigid paddles. The propulsive force generated by the crank links was measured and empirically derived the optimum parameters by using a small-sized experimental apparatus. Finally the robot equipped with the amphibious crank links achieved propulsion on water at 0.13 m/s.

The key approach to achieve this is Deep Neural Network (DNN), but it is well known that training a DNN needs a huge dataset to improve its performance. In a practical application, building such a dataset is not often realistic owing to the cost of manual data annotation. Therefore, we propose a Partially-Shared Deep Neural Network (PS-DNN) which can learn multiple tasks at the same time with a small amount of annotated data. Preliminary results show that the PS-DNN outperforms conventional DNN-based approaches which require fully-annotated data in training in terms of identification accuracy. In addition, it maintains performance even when noise-suppressed signals are used for sound source separation training, and partially annotated data is used for sound source identification training.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759215.pdf","startPage":"1299","endPage":"1304","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partially Shared Deep Neural Network in sound source separation and identification using a UAV-embedded microphone array","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Source separation","Neural networks","Machine learning","Microphone arrays","Acoustics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","microphone arrays","neural nets","source separation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shared deep neural network","sound source separation","UAV-embedded microphone array","noise-contaminated acoustic signals","unmanned aerial vehicle","PS-DNN","sound source identification training"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sound source separation","sound source identification","deep learning","robot audition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Partially Shared Deep Neural Network in sound source separation and identification using a UAV-embedded microphone array","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759215/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16504179","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partially Shared Deep Neural Network in sound source separation and identification using a UAV-embedded microphone array","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1449.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064545S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7759226,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Fridolin Iversen","affiliation":["Maersk McKinney Moller Institute, University of Southern Denmark, Odense M, Denmark"],"firstName":"Thomas Fridolin","lastName":"Iversen","id":"37086208129"},{"name":"Lars-Peter Ellekilde","affiliation":["Maersk McKinney Moller Institute, University of Southern Denmark, Odense M, Denmark"],"firstName":"Lars-Peter","lastName":"Ellekilde","id":"37572028200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3761-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"7759226","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":329},"abstract":"This paper introduces a new sampling strategy and shows that superior performance can be obtained for a range of sampling based robotic motion planners, used in scenarios with low task variance, as found in many vision guided pick and place operations. The strategy uses kernel density estimation to identify regions with high probability of containing configurations being part of feasible solutions, and use the estimation to bias sampling. The kernel densities are initialized with a uniform distribution and are continuously updated, whenever paths are successfully planned and optimized. The system is thereby self-learning and improves performance over time. The sampler is tested on a variety of planners and against other sampling methods in two different scenarios containing robotic arms with 6 degrees of freedom and compared to a state-of-the-art optimization based planning algorithm. Tests show that the sampler learns fast and improves both time taken for solving problems and the quality of the resulting paths compared to other samplers.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Planning","Robots","Optimization","Estimation","Space exploration","Collision avoidance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","manipulators","path planning","robot vision","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["kernel density estimation based self-learning sampling strategy","motion planning","repetitive tasks","sampling based robotic motion planners","task variance","vision guided pick-and-place operations","containing configurations","bias sampling","robotic arms","state-of-the-art optimization based planning algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759226","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759226.pdf","startPage":"1380","endPage":"1387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kernel density estimation based self-learning sampling strategy for motion planning of repetitive tasks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759226","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Kernel density estimation based self-learning sampling strategy for motion planning of repetitive tasks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759226/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759226/","accessionNumber":"16503615","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kernel density estimation based self-learning sampling strategy for motion planning of repetitive tasks","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074458S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7759229,"authors":[{"name":"Joose Rajam\u00e4ki","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Aalto University, Helsinki, Finland"],"firstName":"Joose","lastName":"Rajam\u00e4ki","id":"37086202008"},{"name":"Kourosh Naderi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Aalto University, Helsinki, Finland"],"firstName":"Kourosh","lastName":"Naderi","id":"38667014300"},{"name":"Ville Kyrki","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Aalto University, Helsinki, Finland"],"firstName":"Ville","lastName":"Kyrki","id":"37274001900"},{"name":"Perttu H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Aalto University, Helsinki, Finland"],"firstName":"Perttu","lastName":"H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen","id":"37062745700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3761-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"7759229","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":556},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759229","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dynamic programming","Heuristic algorithms","Trajectory","Covariance matrices","Monte Carlo methods","Computational modeling","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","dynamic programming","gradient methods","manipulators","Monte Carlo methods","trajectory control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampled differential dynamic programming","SaDDP","DDP control algorithm","robotics control research","gradient-based methods","Monte Carlo methods","random simulated trajectory rollouts","Taylor-expansion","black-box dynamics simulations","nonsmooth contacts","multilink arm","random location obstacles","robot arm"]}],"abstract":"We present SaDDP, a sampled version of the widely used differential dynamic programming (DDP) control algorithm.

Each jump consists in a ballistic motion linking two positions in contact with obstacle surfaces. A solution path is thus a sequence of parabola arcs. The originality of the approach is to consider non-sliding constraints at contact points: slipping avoidance is handled by constraining takeoff and landing velocity vectors to 3D friction cones. Furthermore the magnitude of these velocities is bounded. The ballistic motion lying in a vertical plane, we transform the 3D problem into a 2D one. We then solve the motion equations. The solution gives rise to an exact steering method computing a jump path between two contact points while respecting all constraints. The method is integrated into a standard probabilistic roadmap planner. Probabilistic completeness is proven. Simulations illustrate the performance of the approach.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759230","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759230.pdf","startPage":"1410","endPage":"1416","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ballistic motion planning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ballistic motion planning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759230/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759230/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503424","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ballistic motion planning","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06288S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759230","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":7759242,"authors":[{"name":"Steven Holtzen","affiliation":["Center for Vision, Cognition, Learning and Autonomy at the University of California, Los Angeles"],"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Holtzen","id":"37086209680"},{"name":"Yibiao Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Yibiao","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37403488600"},{"name":"Tao Gao","affiliation":["Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Gao","id":"37088503980"},{"name":"Joshua B.

This problem is challenging both from a detection point of view, as there are no markers on the targets available, and from a tracking perspective, due to misdetection and false positives. Furthermore, the methods need to be computationally light, despite the complexity of computer vision algorithms, to be used on UAVs with limited payload. To address these issues we propose a multi-staged framework that incorporates fast object detection using an AdaBoost-based approach, coupled with an on-line visual-based tracking algorithm and a recent sensor fusion and state estimation method. Our framework allows for achieving real-time performance with accurate object detection and tracking without any need of markers and customized, high-performing hardware resources.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vision-based Unmanned Aerial Vehicle detection and tracking for sense and avoid systems","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759252","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759252.pdf","startPage":"1556","endPage":"1561","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759252","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759252/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Vision-based Unmanned Aerial Vehicle detection and tracking for sense and avoid systems","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759252/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503570","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vision-based Unmanned Aerial Vehicle detection and tracking for sense and avoid systems","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067499S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759252","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7759271,"authors":[{"name":"Markus Ryll","affiliation":["LAAS-CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Ryll","id":"38251847500"},{"name":"Davide Bicego","affiliation":["LAAS-CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Davide","lastName":"Bicego","id":"37086071930"},{"name":"Antonio Franchi","affiliation":["LAAS-CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Franchi","id":"37541446900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3761-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"7759271","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":76,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":989},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Propellers","Spinning","Solid modeling","Mathematical model","Force","Synchronization","Three-dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","propellers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["propeller spinning rate saturations","inverse dynamics approaches","generic multirotors","full-pose geometric controller","noncoplanar multirotors","full-pose-tracking flight","UAV","synchronized-tilting hexarotor","FAST-Hex"]}],"abstract":"We present FAST-Hex, a novel UAV concept which is able to smoothly change its configuration from underactuated to fully actuated by using only one additional motor that tilts all propellers at the same time.

In this paper, we take a small step in this direction and propose a generic framework for introspective behavior in perception systems.

The system takes into account the hemispherical optics typical in underwater vehicle designs and implements an array of line-lasers to ensure that mesh-like targets provide reflections in a consistent manner. The developed algorithms for the laser vision system are capable of providing either raw pointcloud data sets from each laser or with additional processing high level information like distance and relative orientation of the target with respect to the ROV can be recovered. An automatic calibration procedure along with the accompanying hardware that was developed, is described in this paper, to reduce the calibration overhead required by regular maintenance operations as is typical for underwater vehicles operating in sea-water.

Autonomous mobile robots navigating in workspaces shared with human agents require motion planning techniques providing seamless integration and smooth navigation in such. Smooth integration in mixed scenarios calls for two abilities of the robot: predicting actions of others and acting predictably for them. The former requirement requests trainable models of agent behaviors in order to accurately forecast their actions in the future, taking into account their reaction on the robot's decisions. A human-like navigation style of the robot facilitates other agents-most likely not aware of the underlying planning technique applied-to predict the robot motion vice versa, resulting in smoother joint navigation. The approach presented in this paper is based on a feature-based maximum entropy model and is able to guide a robot in an unstructured, real-world environment. The model is trained to predict joint behavior of heterogeneous groups of agents from onboard data of a mobile platform. We evaluate the benefit of interaction-aware motion planning in a realistic public setting with a total distance traveled of over 4 km. Interestingly the motion models learned from human-human interaction did not hold for robot-human interaction, due to the high attention and interest of pedestrians in testing basic braking functionality of the robot.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759329","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759329.pdf","startPage":"2096","endPage":"2101","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predicting actions to act predictably: Cooperative partial motion planning with maximum entropy models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759329","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759329/","displayDocTitle":"Predicting actions to act predictably: Cooperative partial motion planning with maximum entropy models","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503818","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759329/","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting actions to act predictably: Cooperative partial motion planning with maximum entropy models","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1259.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053843S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759329","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7759345,"authors":[{"name":"Arren Glover","affiliation":["iCub Facility, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Italy"],"firstName":"Arren","lastName":"Glover","id":"38536087000"},{"name":"Chiara Bartolozzi","affiliation":["iCub Facility, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Italy"],"firstName":"Chiara","lastName":"Bartolozzi","id":"37681790700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3761-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"7759345","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1170},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Event-driven ball detection and gaze fixation in clutter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Transforms","Clutter","Robot vision systems","Tracking","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","gaze tracking","humanoid robots","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["event-driven ball detection","gaze fixation","temporal-dynamics","intrinsic motion segmentation","event-based cameras","robotic tasks","low-latency visual tracking","event-driven iCub humanoid robot grasps","camera motion","background clutter","event-based tracking algorithms","stationary cameras","clean event-streams","Hough-based circle detection algorithm","optical flow information","spatio-temporal event space","directed-Hough algorithm","background event-clutter","online robot control","gaze following"]}],"abstract":"The fast temporal-dynamics and intrinsic motion segmentation of event-based cameras are beneficial for robotic tasks that require low-latency visual tracking and control, for example a robot catching a ball. When the event-driven iCub humanoid robot grasps an object its head and torso move, inducing camera motion, and tracked objects become no longer trivially segmented amongst the mass of background clutter. Current event-based tracking algorithms have mostly considered stationary cameras that have clean event-streams with minimal clutter. This paper introduces novel methods to extend the Hough-based circle detection algorithm using optical flow information that is readily extracted from the spatio-temporal event space. Results indicate the proposed directed-Hough algorithm is more robust to other moving objects and the background event-clutter. Finally, we demonstrate successful on-line robot control and gaze following on the iCub robot.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759345","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759345.pdf","startPage":"2203","endPage":"2208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759345","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759345","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759345/","displayDocTitle":"Event-driven ball detection and gaze fixation in clutter","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16504066","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759345/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event-driven ball detection and gaze fixation in clutter","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0750.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051411S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":7759351,"authors":[{"name":"Friederike Schneemann","affiliation":["Audi Electronics Venture GmbH, Gaimersheim, Germany","Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum, Group Theory of Cognitive Systems, Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Friederike","lastName":"Schneemann","id":"37085856079"},{"name":"Patrick Heinemann","affiliation":["Patrick Heinemann is with Audi Electronics Venture GmbH, Gaimersheim, Germany"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Heinemann","id":"37589953400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3761-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"7759351","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1301},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Roads","Vehicles","Image edge detection","History","Support vector machines","Microprocessors","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image classification","object detection","pedestrians","support vector machines","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous driving","urban environments","context-based detection","pedestrian crossing intention detection","situation awareness","self-driving vehicles","own behavior planning","context-based feature descriptor","SVM classifier","pedestrian movement captures","spatial layout","scene elements","inner-city traffic","context-based data","pedestrian posture","pedestrian body movement"]}],"abstract":"This paper focuses on the detection of pedestrian crossing intention to improve the situation awareness for autonomous driving in urban environments. A new definition of pedestrian crossing intention is discussed, which allows self-driving vehicles to identify pedestrians, whose intended actions are relevant for the own behavior planning, at an early stage. We propose a context-based feature descriptor in combination with a SVM classifier for detecting this. The descriptor captures the movement of a pedestrian relative to the road and the spatial layout of other scene elements in a generic manner. The performance of the feature descriptor is evaluated in relation to various SVM setups. Feasibility of the approach is demonstrated with data captured on-board of a vehicle in real inner-city traffic. The evaluation of the classification results confirms, that context-based data is a promising indicator for pedestrian crossing intention and that the proposed feature descriptor is capable of representing this. It is further shown that a lack of information about the pedestrian's posture and body movement results in a delayed detection of the pedestrians changing their crossing intention when compared to a human observer.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Context-based detection of pedestrian crossing intention for autonomous driving in urban environments","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759351","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759351.pdf","startPage":"2243","endPage":"2248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759351","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759351/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Context-based detection of pedestrian crossing intention for autonomous driving in urban environments","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759351/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16504209","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Context-based detection of pedestrian crossing intention for autonomous driving in urban environments","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1279.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072973S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759351","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7759357,"authors":[{"name":"Justin Miller","affiliation":["Laboratory of Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Justin","lastName":"Miller","id":"37086030933"},{"name":"Andres Hasfura","affiliation":["Laboratory of Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Andres","lastName":"Hasfura","id":"37086204987"},{"name":"Shih-Yuan Liu","affiliation":["Laboratory of Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Shih-Yuan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085818712"},{"name":"Jonathan P.

A key factor in the success of an MOD system is the ability to measure and respond to real-time customer arrival data. Real time traffic arrival rate data is traditionally difficult to obtain due to the need to install fixed sensors throughout the MOD network. This paper presents a framework for measuring pedestrian traffic arrival rates using sensors onboard the vehicles that make up the MOD fleet. A novel distributed fusion algorithm is presented which combines onboard LIDAR and camera sensor measurements to detect trajectories of pedestrians with a 90% detection hit rate with 1.5 false positives per minute. A novel moving observer method is introduced to estimate pedestrian arrival rates from pedestrian trajectories collected from mobile sensors. The moving observer method is evaluated in both simulation and hardware and is shown to achieve arrival rate estimates comparable to those that would be obtained with multiple stationary sensors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759357/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7759357/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503503","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic arrival rate estimation for campus Mobility On Demand network graphs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic arrival rate estimation for campus Mobility On Demand network graphs","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0977.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07321S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759357","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7759361,"authors":[{"name":"Maxime Latulippe","affiliation":["Dept. of Comp. and Soft.

In DFN, a limited number of these gradient sources, called the cores, must be positioned properly around a patient in a Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanner to induce the required directional forces on the navigated therapeutic carriers. To overcome some limitations of the previous approach for solving this problem, here we propose a novel and conceptually simple multidimensional variant of the well-known Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. This variant, called Progressive Multidimensional PSO (PMD-PSO), enables a tradeoff between the quality and the complexity of the solutions by progressively increasing the number of dimensions in the search space. We apply this algorithm to the core placement problem using an improved fitness function for the evaluation of a core configuration given a vascular path towards a target. Experiments on simulated vasculatures show that, while the approach can effectively solve this inverse problem, PMD-PSO exhibits better performances for DFN compared with two other multidimensional PSO variants.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759361/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16503812","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759361/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Progressive Multidimensional Particle Swarm Optimizer for magnetic core placement in Dipole Field Navigation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Progressive Multidimensional Particle Swarm Optimizer for magnetic core placement in Dipole Field Navigation","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0182.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060276S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759361","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7759384,"authors":[{"name":"Ulysse C\u00f4t\u00e9 Allard","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering"],"firstName":"Ulysse","lastName":"C\u00f4t\u00e9 Allard","id":"37086061577"},{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois Nougarou","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering"],"firstName":"Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Nougarou","id":"37601607800"},{"name":"Cheikh Latyr Fall","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering"],"firstName":"Cheikh Latyr","lastName":"Fall","id":"37085707442"},{"name":"Philippe Gigu\u00e8re","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Gigu\u00e8re","id":"37560636500"},{"name":"Cl\u00e9ment Gosselin","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universit\u00e9 Laval, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada"],"firstName":"Cl\u00e9ment","lastName":"Gosselin","id":"37085700129"},{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois Laviolette","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering"],"firstName":"Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Laviolette","id":"37697849100"},{"name":"Benoit Gosselin","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering"],"firstName":"Benoit","lastName":"Gosselin","id":"37086061085"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3761-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"7759384","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1413},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manipulators","Electrodes","Robustness","Spectrogram","Muscles","Wrist"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromyography","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical robotics","medical signal processing","neurocontrollers","prosthetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural network","robotic arm guidance","sEMG","frequency features","amputees","robotic prosthetic devices","surface electromyography","constant recalibration","prostheses guidance","convolutional neural networks","gesture recognition","machine learning"]}],"abstract":"Recently, robotics has been seen as a key solution to improve the quality of life of amputees. In order to create smarter robotic prosthetic devices to be used in an everyday context, one must be able to interface them seamlessly with the end-user in an inexpensive, yet reliable way. In this paper, we are looking at guiding a robotic device by detecting gestures through measurement of the electrical activity of muscles captured by surface electromyography (sEMG). Reliable sEMG-based gesture classifiers for end-users are challenging to design, as they must be extremely robust to signal drift, muscle fatigue and small electrode displacement without the need for constant recalibration. In spite of extensive research, sophisticated sEMG classifiers for prostheses guidance are not yet widely used, as systems often fail to solve these issues simultaneously. We propose to address these problems by employing Convolutional Neural Networks. Specifically as a first step, we demonstrate their viability to the problem of gesture recognition for a low-cost, low-sampling rate (200Hz) consumer-grade, 8-channel, dry electrodes sEMG device called Myo armband (Thalmic Labs) on able-bodied subjects. To this effect, we assessed the robustness of this machine learning oriented approach by classifying a combination of 7 hand/wrist gestures with an accuracy of ~97.9% in real-time, over a period of 6 consecutive days with no recalibration. In addition, we used the classifier (in conjunction with orientation data) to guide a 6DoF robotic arm, using the armband with the same speed and precision as with a joystick. We also show that the classifier is able to generalize to different users by testing it on 18 participants.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759384","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759384.pdf","startPage":"2464","endPage":"2470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A convolutional neural network for robotic arm guidance using sEMG based frequency-features","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759384/","displayDocTitle":"A convolutional neural network for robotic arm guidance using sEMG based frequency-features","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759384/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503680","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A convolutional neural network for robotic arm guidance using sEMG based frequency-features","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1495.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094868S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759384","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7759387,"authors":[{"name":"Krittin Pachtrachai","affiliation":["Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), University College London, UK"],"firstName":"Krittin","lastName":"Pachtrachai","id":"37086203480"},{"name":"Max Allan","affiliation":["Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), University College London, UK"],"firstName":"Max","lastName":"Allan","id":"37086200641"},{"name":"Vijay Pawar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University College London, UK"],"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Pawar","id":"38191148100"},{"name":"Stephen Hailes","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University College London, UK"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Hailes","id":"37269406400"},{"name":"Danail Stoyanov","affiliation":["Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), University College London, UK"],"firstName":"Danail","lastName":"Stoyanov","id":"37563622300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3761-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"7759387","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":801},"abstract":"In a robot mounted camera arrangement, hand-eye calibration estimates the rigid relationship between the robot and camera coordinate frames. Most hand-eye calibration techniques use a calibration object to estimate the relative transformation of the camera in several views of the calibration object and link these to the forward kinematics of the robot to compute the hand-eye transformation. Such approaches achieve good accuracy for general use but for applications such as robotic assisted minimally invasive surgery, acquiring a calibration sequence multiple times during a procedure is not practical. In this paper, we present a new approach to tackle the problem by using the robotic surgical instruments as the calibration object with well known geometry from CAD models used for manufacturing. Our approach removes the requirement of a custom sterile calibration object to be used in the operating room and it simplifies the process of acquiring calibration data when the laparoscope is constrained to move around a remote centre of motion. This is the first demonstration of the feasibility to perform hand-eye calibration using components of the robotic system itself and we show promising validation results on synthetic data as well as data acquired with the da Vinci Research Kit.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Cameras","Robot vision systems","Robot kinematics","Instruments","Three-dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CAD","calibration","cameras","end effectors","manipulator kinematics","medical robotics","surgery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hand-eye calibration","robotic assisted minimally invasive surgery","robot mounted camera arrangement","robot coordinate frames","camera coordinate frames","calibration object","relative camera transformation estimation","robot forward kinematics","hand-eye transformation","calibration sequence","CAD models","sterile calibration object","operating room","laparoscope","synthetic data","da Vinci Research Kit"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759387","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759387","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759387.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759387","startPage":"2485","endPage":"2491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hand-eye calibration for robotic assisted minimally invasive surgery without a calibration object","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hand-eye calibration for robotic assisted minimally invasive surgery without a calibration object","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759387/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759387/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16504096","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hand-eye calibration for robotic assisted minimally invasive surgery without a calibration object","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1284.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091393S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759387","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7759394,"authors":[{"name":"Minas V.

A constrained optimization scheme utilizes analytical models that describe the kinematics of adaptive hands and classic conventions for modelling quasistatically the manipulation problem, providing intuition about the problem mechanics. A machine learning (ML) scheme is used in order to split the problem space, deriving task-specific models that account for difficult to model, dynamic phenomena (e.g., slipping). In this respect, the ML scheme: 1) employs the simulation module in order to explore the feasible manipulation paths for a specific hand-object system, 2) feeds the feasible paths to an experimental setup that collects manipulation data in an automated fashion, 3) uses clustering techniques in order to group together similar manipulation trajectories, 4) trains a set of task-specific manipulation models and 5) uses classification techniques in order to trigger a task-specific model based on the user provided task specifications. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is experimentally validated using various adaptive robot hands in 2D and 3D in-hand manipulation tasks.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759394","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","startPage":"2534","endPage":"2541","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759394.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759394","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptation models","Robot kinematics","Grasping","Robot sensing systems","Numerical models","Load modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dexterous manipulators","learning (artificial intelligence)","manipulator kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["task-specific models","dexterous robot hands","in-hand manipulation","adaptive robot hands","machine learning methods","constrained optimization","adaptive hand kinematics","quasistatical modelling","dynamic phenomena","manipulation paths","hand-object system","manipulation data","clustering techniques","manipulation trajectories","classification techniques"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Learning task-specific models for dexterous, in-hand manipulation with simple, adaptive robot hands","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503565","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7759394/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759394/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning task-specific models for dexterous, in-hand manipulation with simple, adaptive robot hands","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056507S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":7759397,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Paolini","affiliation":["The Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Paolini","id":"38056918400"},{"name":"Matthew T.

The study of robotic regrasping has generally been limited to use of theoretical analytical models and cases with little uncertainty. Analytical models and simulations have so far proven unable to capture the complexity of the real world. Empirical statistical models are more promising, but collecting good data is difficult. In this paper, we collect data from 3300 robot regrasps, and use this data to learn two probability functions: 1) The probability that the object is still in the robot's hand after a regrasp action; and 2) The probability distribution of the object pose after the regrasp given that the object is still grasped. Both of these functions are learned using kernel density estimation with a similarity metric over object pose. We show that our data-driven models achieve comparable accuracy to a geometric model and an off-the-shelf simulator in classification and prediction tasks, while also enabling us to predict probability distributions.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759397","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759397","startPage":"2554","endPage":"2560","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759397.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-driven statistical modeling of a cube regrasp","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Data-driven statistical modeling of a cube regrasp","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759397/","accessionNumber":"16503420","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759397/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-driven statistical modeling of a cube regrasp","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1684.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.154776S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759397","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7759404,"authors":[{"name":"Malika Meghjani","affiliation":["Centre for Intelligent Machines, McGill University, Montr\u00e9al Qu\u00e9bec, Canada"],"firstName":"Malika","lastName":"Meghjani","id":"37393934900"},{"name":"Sandeep Manjanna","affiliation":["Centre for Intelligent Machines, McGill University, Montr\u00e9al Qu\u00e9bec, Canada"],"firstName":"Sandeep","lastName":"Manjanna","id":"37072300900"},{"name":"Gregory Dudek","affiliation":["Centre for Intelligent Machines, McGill University, Montr\u00e9al Qu\u00e9bec, Canada"],"firstName":"Gregory","lastName":"Dudek","id":"37274057100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3761-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"7759404","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759404","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-target rendezvous search","abstract":"In this paper, we examine multi-target search, where one or more targets must be found by a moving robot.

Its objective is to allow mobile robots to explore an unknown environment without colliding into other objects. It is the basis for various tasks, e.g. surveillance and rescue, etc. Previous approaches mainly focused on geometric models (such as constructing local cost-maps) which could be regarded as low-level intelligence without any cognitive process. Recently, deep learning has made great breakthroughs in computer vision, especially for recognition and cognitive tasks. It takes advantage of the hierarchical models inspired by human brain structures. However, it is a fact that deep learning, up till now, has seldom been used for controlling and decision making. Inspired by the advantages of deep learning, we take indoor obstacle avoidance as example to show the effectiveness of a hierarchical structure that fuses a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a decision process. It is a highly compact network structure that takes raw depth images as input, and generates control commands as network output, by which a model-less obstacle avoidance behavior is achieved. We test our approach in real-world indoor environments. The new findings and results are reported at the end of the paper.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759428","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759428.pdf","startPage":"2759","endPage":"2764","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A deep-network solution towards model-less obstacle avoidance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A deep-network solution towards model-less obstacle avoidance","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7759428/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503852","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759428/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A deep-network solution towards model-less obstacle avoidance","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0084.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068272S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7759429,"authors":[{"name":"Anh Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of Advanced Robotics, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Genova, Italy"],"firstName":"Anh","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37086209468"},{"name":"Dimitrios Kanoulas","affiliation":["Department of Advanced Robotics, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Genova, Italy"],"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Kanoulas","id":"38230575500"},{"name":"Darwin G.

This is due to their vast number of degrees of freedom in addition to the noisy and incomplete measurements robots have to cope with. Therefore, we suggest focusing on the structures and object parts which are relevant to the task at hand. The openings (e.g., at the waist, leg or sleeve ends) characterize garments surprisingly well, not only from a topological perspective, but also in terms of their inherent function, namely dressing. We model openings as closed, oriented chains of movable points which we refer to as Active Boundary Component Models (ABCMs). Compared with the hardly predictable motions of an overall piece of clothing, relatively strict assumptions regarding the dynamics of these contour models can be made. We express these assumptions through position-based constraints which drastically restrict the degrees of freedom. In the present paper, we show how ABCMs can be initialized exploiting geometric prior knowledge of garments, and how they can be tracked visually using 3D point cloud data. Additionally, we consider the task of sliding a rod through a pant leg as a first step toward robotic dressing assistance for physically handicapped persons.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clothing","Three-dimensional displays","Legged locomotion","Skeleton","Topology","Robot kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clothing","handicapped aids","object tracking","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active boundary component models","ABCMs","robotic dressing assistance","deformable objects dynamics","clothing","garments","contour models","position-based constraints","visual tracking","3D point cloud data","physically handicapped persons"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759436","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759436","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759436.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759436","startPage":"2811","endPage":"2818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active Boundary Component Models for robotic dressing assistance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Active Boundary Component Models for robotic dressing assistance","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759436/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759436/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503505","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Boundary Component Models for robotic dressing assistance","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0688.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088172S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759436","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7759458,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Mudassir Khan","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, LUMS, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muhammad Mudassir","lastName":"Khan","id":"37086204394"},{"name":"Haider Ali","affiliation":["Robotics and Mechatronics Center, German Aerospace Center (DLR), Germany"],"firstName":"Haider","lastName":"Ali","id":"38244146400"},{"name":"Karsten Berns","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, TU Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Karsten","lastName":"Berns","id":"37274823100"},{"name":"Abubakr Muhammad","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, LUMS, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Abubakr","lastName":"Muhammad","id":"37082077200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3761-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"7759458","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Roads","Three-dimensional displays","Indexes","Space vehicles","Robot sensing systems","Solid modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","path planning","road safety","road vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["road traversability analysis","roadmaps network properties","autonomous navigation","robotics","road safety","sensor-data driven metric","road traversability index","RTI","distance modulated index","3D sensor data","roadmap based motion planning graph"]}],"abstract":"Traversability analysis is an important aspect of autonomous navigation in robotics. In this paper, we relate the idea of traversability to safety and ease of road usage by defining a novel sensor-data driven metric called Road Traversability Index (RTI). The RTI translate the geometric interaction of vehicle with road into a distance modulated index that can be used as advice for a human driver or an autonomous agent intending to traverse a particular road segment using a specific vehicle. We present a framework in which 3D sensor data is converted into a road model, which in turn is converted into a roadmap based motion planning graph to represent the underlying configuration space. The RTI is defined as a function of the roadmap by axiomatically satisfying all required properties of road traversability. We have tested our algorithmic framework on simulated scenarios to explore safety; and real-world data sets to discover aspects of traversability for vehicles of various types. Experimental results show that RTI is a practical tool that reveals information that may be hidden to human inspection or other methods of assessment that do not explicitly model a vehicle.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759458","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759458.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","startPage":"2960","endPage":"2965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Road Traversability analysis using network properties of roadmaps","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759458","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Road Traversability analysis using network properties of roadmaps","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759458/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503877","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7759458/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Road Traversability analysis using network properties of roadmaps","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0359.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058665S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7759466,"authors":[{"name":"Lorenz Wellhausen","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Lab at ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Lorenz","lastName":"Wellhausen","id":"37086200470"},{"name":"Mithun George Jacob","affiliation":["Research Scientist at the Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center, Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mithun George","lastName":"Jacob","id":"37086211162"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3761-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"7759466","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759466","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Roads","Vehicles","Uncertainty","Knowledge based systems","Bayes methods","Vehicle dynamics","Probabilistic logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","graph theory","inference mechanisms","intelligent transportation systems","knowledge based systems","probability","road traffic control","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["map-optimized probabilistic traffic rule evaluation","traffic rule handling","autonomous driving","logical statements","sensor measurement uncertainty","exchangeable traffic rules module","knowledge base","first-order logic","local jurisdiction","logic graph","road geometry","road map","map information","Bayesian network","probabilistic inference"]}],"abstract":"Current traffic rule handling in autonomous driving relies on non-scalable methods such as explicitly hard-coding sets of logical statements to evaluate rules. This is sufficient for early prototypes but is not scalable for larger systems designed to work in arbitrary locations. Such methods can also become problematic when traversing different geographical entities with changing traffic rules. Additionally, they do not adequately convey the uncertainty of the traffic rule evaluation stemming from uncertainty in sensor measurements. We propose an exchangeable traffic rules module which takes a knowledge base of sentences in first-order logic as input. These sentences consist of a limited number of high-level queries which are independent of local jurisdiction (e.g. can I turn right?). The knowledge base is then compiled into a potentially large logic graph. However, only a relatively small subset of the knowledge base is relevant for specific road geometries (e.g. some of the rules applicable to an intersection is not relevant for a T-junction). Since detailed road maps are available for autonomous driving, this information can be used to resolve these subsets in the knowledge base which only require map knowledge. Therefore, map information can be used to convert a single, large logic graph into a set of smaller, map-optimized logic graphs pruned for specific road geometries. The optimized graphs are then converted into Bayesian networks to facilitate probabilistic inference. Experiments were conducted using a traffic and scenario simulation framework. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in performance when using map-optimized logic graphs over a traditional first-order logic knowledge base.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759466","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759466","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759466.pdf","startPage":"3012","endPage":"3017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Map-optimized probabilistic traffic rule evaluation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759466/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Map-optimized probabilistic traffic rule evaluation","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503800","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759466/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Map-optimized probabilistic traffic rule evaluation","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0867.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059399S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759466","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":7759495,"authors":[{"name":"Victor Paredes","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Paredes","id":"37085706230"},{"name":"Woolim Hong","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Woolim","lastName":"Hong","id":"37086200267"},{"name":"Shawanee Patrick","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Shawanee","lastName":"Patrick","id":"37086211065"},{"name":"Pilwon Hur","affiliation":["Texas A&M University College Station, College Station, TX, US"],"firstName":"Pilwon","lastName":"Hur"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3761-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"7759495","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Legged locomotion","Trajectory","Prosthetics","Splines (mathematics)","Optimization","Knee","PD control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion control","optimisation","prosthetics","splines (mathematics)","trajectory control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spline generation","powered transfemoral prostheses","robotic systems","transfemoral amputees mobility","healthy human legs","powered prosthetic device","upslope walking gaits","online algorithmic formulation","human gait characteristics","ankle trajectories","knee trajectories","flat ground walking","nominal flat ground gaits","cubic splines","online optimization","impedance controller","prosthetic legs","AMPRO II","automatic motion switches"]}],"abstract":"Powered transfemoral prostheses are robotic systems that aim to restore the mobility of transfemoral amputees by mimicking the functionalities of healthy human legs. The advantage of using a powered prosthetic device is the enhanced performance on various terrains. One of the most frequent terrain found during daily locomotion (other than flat ground) is the surface with slope. In this work, we introduce a framework to generate upslope walking gaits automatically utilizing an online algorithmic formulation. This approach is inspired from analyzing human gait characteristics during upslope walking. In particularly, it is found that the ankle and knee trajectories of upslope walking share a similar pattern with flat ground walking during the middle section (from 20% to 80%) of one step. This observation motivates us to propose an approach of blending the first portion of nominal flat ground gaits with a set of cubic splines to achieve upslope gaits. Importantly, parameters of these cubic splines are solved using an online optimization, which gives the users ability to traverse in different terrains without using any intention detection algorithm. For the last portion of a step, an impedance controller with low gains is considered upon the contact of prosthetic legs to the ground, which allows the users to step onto unknown terrains. The proposed framework is validated on a custom transfemoral prosthesis AMPRO II with showing automatic motion switches between flat ground and upslope walking.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759495","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759495.pdf","startPage":"3204","endPage":"3211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Upslope walking with transfemoral prosthesis using optimization based spline generation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759495","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759495/","displayDocTitle":"Upslope walking with transfemoral prosthesis using optimization based spline generation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503470","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759495/","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Upslope walking with transfemoral prosthesis using optimization based spline generation","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1657.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088146S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759495","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7759547,"authors":[{"name":"Felix Burget","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, University of Freiburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Felix","lastName":"Burget","id":"37077786800"},{"name":"Maren Bennewitz","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, University of Bonn, Germany"],"firstName":"Maren","lastName":"Bennewitz","id":"37324765000"},{"name":"Wolfram Burgard","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, University of Freiburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfram","lastName":"Burgard","id":"37270485300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3761-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"7759547","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1044},"abstract":"Mobile manipulators installed in warehouses and factories for conveying goods between working stations need to meet the requirements of time-critical workflows.

Model-based reinforcement learning can achieve good sample efficiency, but requires the ability to learn a model of the dynamics that is good enough to learn an effective policy. In this work, we develop a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that combines prior knowledge from previous tasks with online adaptation of the dynamics model. These two ingredients enable highly sample-efficient learning even in regimes where estimating the true dynamics is very difficult, since the online model adaptation allows the method to locally compensate for unmodeled variation in the dynamics. We encode the prior experience into a neural network dynamics model, adapt it online by progressively refitting a local linear model of the dynamics, and use model predictive control to plan under these dynamics. Our experimental results show that this approach can be used to solve a variety of complex robotic manipulation tasks in just a single attempt, using prior data from other manipulation behaviors.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759592","startPage":"4019","endPage":"4026","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759592.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"One-shot learning of manipulation skills with online dynamics adaptation and neural network priors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759592/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"One-shot learning of manipulation skills with online dynamics adaptation and neural network priors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759592/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16503546","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"One-shot learning of manipulation skills with online dynamics adaptation and neural network priors","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1340.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079185S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759592","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-25"},{"_id":7759610,"authors":[{"name":"Valentina Vasco","affiliation":["iCub Facility, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Italy."],"firstName":"Valentina","lastName":"Vasco","id":"37086078872"},{"name":"Arren Glover","affiliation":["iCub Facility, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Italy."],"firstName":"Arren","lastName":"Glover","id":"38536087000"},{"name":"Chiara Bartolozzi","affiliation":["iCub Facility, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Italy."],"firstName":"Chiara","lastName":"Bartolozzi","id":"37681790700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3761-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"7759610","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1939},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Image edge detection","Target tracking","Visualization","Robot vision systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","computational complexity","edge detection","humanoid robots","image resolution","image sensors","mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["event-based Harris corner detection","temporal resolution","compressed visual information","asynchronous neuromorphic event-based camera","dynamic vision sensor","neuromorphic iCub robot","error distribution","motion velocities","computational cost"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast event-based Harris corner detection exploiting the advantages of event-driven cameras","abstract":"The detection of consistent feature points in an image is fundamental for various kinds of computer vision techniques, such as stereo matching, object recognition, target tracking and optical flow computation. This paper presents an event-based approach to the detection of corner points, which benefits from the high temporal resolution, compressed visual information and low latency provided by an asynchronous neuromorphic event-based camera. The proposed method adapts the commonly used Harris corner detector to the event-based data, in which frames are replaced by a stream of asynchronous events produced in response to local light changes at \u03bcs temporal resolution. Responding only to changes in its field of view, an event-based camera naturally enhances edges in the scene, simplifying the detection of corner features. We characterised and tested the method on both a controlled pattern and a real scenario, using the dynamic vision sensor (DVS) on the neuromorphic iCub robot. The method detects corners with a typical error distribution within 2 pixels. The error is constant for different motion velocities and directions, indicating a consistent detection across the scene and over time. We achieve a detection rate proportional to speed, higher than frame-based technique for a significant amount of motion in the scene, while also reducing the computational cost.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759610","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759610.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759610","startPage":"4144","endPage":"4149","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759610","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759610/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Fast event-based Harris corner detection exploiting the advantages of event-driven cameras","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7759610/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503968","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast event-based Harris corner detection exploiting the advantages of event-driven cameras","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0776.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049551S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":7759617,"authors":[{"name":"John Wang","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085454664"},{"name":"Edwin Olson","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Edwin","lastName":"Olson","id":"37413277900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3761-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"7759617","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":198,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2507},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759617","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Image edge detection","Image segmentation","Robustness","Robots","Decoding","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural scenes","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AprilTag 2","robust fiducial detection","tag detector","tag coding scheme","false positives","coding system","detection speed"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759617","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759617.pdf","startPage":"4193","endPage":"4198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AprilTag 2: Efficient and robust fiducial detection","abstract":"AprilTags and other passive fiducial markers require specialized algorithms to detect markers among other features in a natural scene.

The tag coding scheme is unchanged, retaining the same robustness to false positives inherent to the coding system. The new detector improves performance with higher detection rates, fewer false positives, and lower computational time. Improved performance on small images allows the use of decimated input images, resulting in dramatic gains in detection speed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759617/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16504172","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759617/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"AprilTag 2: Efficient and robust fiducial detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AprilTag 2: Efficient and robust fiducial detection","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1377.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043137S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"198","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759617","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":7759620,"authors":[{"name":"Ruben Gomez-Ojeda","affiliation":["Mapir Group., Universidad de M\u00e1laga.

This paper extends a popular semi-direct approach to monocular visual odometry known as SVO [1] to work with line segments, hence obtaining a more robust system capable of dealing with both textured and structured environments. The proposed odometry system allows for the fast tracking of line segments since it eliminates the necessity of continuously extracting and matching features between subsequent frames. The method, of course, has a higher computational burden than the original SVO, but it still runs with frequencies of 60Hz on a personal computer while performing robustly in a wider variety of scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759620","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759620.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","startPage":"4211","endPage":"4216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PL-SVO: Semi-direct Monocular Visual Odometry by combining points and line segments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759620","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PL-SVO: Semi-direct Monocular Visual Odometry by combining points and line segments","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759620/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503845","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7759620/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PL-SVO: Semi-direct Monocular Visual Odometry by combining points and line segments","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1619.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060083S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759620","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":7759622,"authors":[{"name":"Zherong Pan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina"],"firstName":"Zherong","lastName":"Pan","id":"37086067204"},{"name":"Dinesh Manocha","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina"],"firstName":"Dinesh","lastName":"Manocha","id":"37267825600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3761-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"7759622","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":234},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Planning","Trajectory","Containers","Computational modeling","Robots","Dynamics","Liquids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","collision avoidance","flow control","flow simulation","identification","manipulator dynamics","manipulator kinematics","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fluid manipulation","optimization-based motion planning algorithm","smooth collision-free trajectory","target container","fluid dynamics constraints","exact fluid simulation","simplified dynamics model","physically inspired approximations","system identification","collision avoidance","manipulator dynamics constraints","manipulator kinematics","fluid dynamics characteristics","Navier-Stokes fluid simulation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759622","abstract":"We present an optimization-based motion planning algorithm to compute a smooth, collision-free trajectory for a manipulator used to transfer a liquid from a source to a target container.

When deployed, a remote operator of the HFV defines the desired trajectory for the LFV in the HFV's camera frame (image frame). Due to the circulatory motion of the HFV, the resulting motion trajectory of the LFV in the image frame is periodic in time, thus an adaptive repetitive control system is exploited to improve the tracking precision from one operating period to the next. Not only is the adaptive control law able to deal with uncertainties in the camera's intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, but it can also tolerate uncertainties in the localization of the LFV. The design and stability analysis of the closed-loop control system is presented, where the Lyapunov approach is used to show stability. Simulations and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for controlling the movement of a low-flying quadcopter vehicle. Results show good tracking performance for three simulated test cases, where the average maximum tracking error is reduced by approximately 75% compared to the performance of a standard adaptive visual-servo controller.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759627.pdf","startPage":"4258","endPage":"4265","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759627","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759627","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive repetitive visual-servo control of a low-flying unmanned aerial vehicle with an uncalibrated high-flying camera","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Robot vision systems","Vehicles","Trajectory","Tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","closed loop systems","helicopters","stability","trajectory control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["standard adaptive visual-servo controller","average maximum tracking error","low-flying quadcopter vehicle","closed loop control system","stability analysis","adaptive control law","motion trajectory","circulatory motion","image frame","HFV camera frame","remote operator","mobile ground robot","LFV","low-flying vehicle","uncalibrated camera","high-flying vehicle","adaptive repetitive visual-servo control system","uncalibrated high-flying camera","low-flying unmanned aerial vehicle"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759627/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive repetitive visual-servo control of a low-flying unmanned aerial vehicle with an uncalibrated high-flying camera","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759627/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16504101","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive repetitive visual-servo control of a low-flying unmanned aerial vehicle with an uncalibrated high-flying camera","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0587.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080408S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7759628,"authors":[{"name":"Firas Abi-Farraj","affiliation":["CNRS at Irisa and Inria Rennes Bretagne Atlantique, Campus de Beaulieu, Rennes Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Firas","lastName":"Abi-Farraj","id":"37086034393"},{"name":"Nicol\u00f2 Pedemonte","affiliation":["CNRS at Irisa and Inria Rennes Bretagne Atlantique, Campus de Beaulieu, Rennes Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Nicol\u00f2","lastName":"Pedemonte","id":"37086037541"},{"name":"Paolo Robuffo Giordano","affiliation":["CNRS at Irisa and Inria Rennes Bretagne Atlantique, Campus de Beaulieu, Rennes Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Robuffo Giordano","id":"37544316400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3761-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"7759628","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":546},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Grippers","Cameras","Three-dimensional displays","Visualization","Manipulators","Robot vision systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","dexterous manipulators","force feedback","motion control","robot vision","telerobotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual-based shared control architecture","remote object telemanipulation","nuclear waste cleaning","environmental remediation project","visual information","robotic arms","camera","gripper motion regulation","force feedback device"]}],"abstract":"Cleaning up the past half century of nuclear waste represents the largest environmental remediation project in the whole Europe. Nuclear waste must be sorted, segregated and stored according to its radiation level in order to optimize maintenance costs. The objective of this work is to develop a shared control framework for remote manipulation of objects using visual information. In the presented scenario, the human operator must control a system composed of two robotic arms, one equipped with a gripper and the other one with a camera. In order to facilitate the operator's task, a subset of the gripper motion are assumed to be regulated by an autonomous algorithm exploiting the camera view of the scene. At the same time, the operator has control over the remaining null-space motions w.r.t. the primary (autonomous) task by acting on a force feedback device. A novel force feedback algorithm is also proposed with the aim of informing the user about possible constraints of the robotic system such as, for instance, joint limits. Human/hardware-in-the-loop experiments with simulated slave robots and a real master device are finally reported for demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759628","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759628.pdf","startPage":"4266","endPage":"4273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A visual-based shared control architecture for remote telemanipulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759628","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759628/","displayDocTitle":"A visual-based shared control architecture for remote telemanipulation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503786","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759628/","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A visual-based shared control architecture for remote telemanipulation","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0695.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091436S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7759632,"authors":[{"name":"Michele Mancini","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Mancini","id":"37085761827"},{"name":"Gabriele Costante","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy"],"firstName":"Gabriele","lastName":"Costante","id":"38541290800"},{"name":"Paolo Valigi","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Valigi","id":"37284742100"},{"name":"Thomas A.

This is often achieved through scene depth estimation, by various means. When fast motion is considered, the detection range must be longer enough to allow for safe avoidance and path planning. Current solutions often make assumption on the motion of the vehicle that limit their applicability, or work at very limited ranges due to intrinsic constraints. We propose a novel appearance-based Object Detection system that is able to detect obstacles at very long range and at a very high speed (~ 300Hz), without making assumptions on the type of motion. We achieve these results using a Deep Neural Network approach trained on real and synthetic images and trading some depth accuracy for fast, robust and consistent operation. We show how photo-realistic synthetic images are able to solve the problem of training set dimension and variety typical of machine learning approaches, and how our system is robust to massive blurring of test images.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759632","startPage":"4296","endPage":"4303","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759632.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast robust monocular depth estimation for Obstacle Detection with fully convolutional networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Optical imaging","Three-dimensional displays","Convolution","Robustness","Robots","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive blurring","machine learning","photo-realistic synthetic images","deep neural network","object detection system","intrinsic constraints","path planning","safe avoidance","scene depth estimation","unpredictable environment","autonomous systems","robotic system","fully convolutional networks","obstacle detection","robust monocular depth estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759632/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Fast robust monocular depth estimation for Obstacle Detection with fully convolutional networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759632/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16504099","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast robust monocular depth estimation for Obstacle Detection with fully convolutional networks","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.215066S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7759637,"authors":[{"name":"Arthur W.

The parallel structure can be reconfigured inside the patient's body to satisfy changing task requirements such as reaching initially inaccessible locations or modifying mechanical stiffness for manipulation or palpation. Another potential advantage of the CRISP concept is that many small (needle-sized) entry points into the patient may be preferable in terms of both patient healing and cosmesis to the single (or multiple) larger ports needed to admit current surgical robots. This paper presents a mechanics-based model for CRISP forward and inverse kinematics, along with experimental validation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759637.pdf","startPage":"4330","endPage":"4336","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759637","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable parallel continuum robots for incisionless surgery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Needles","Shafts","Surgery","Manipulators","Robot sensing systems","Force"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuum mechanics","manipulator kinematics","medical robotics","surgery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable parallel continuum robots","minimally-invasive surgery","continuum reconfigurable incisionless surgical parallel paradigm","needle-diameter devices","parallel structures","mechanical stiffness","patient healing","cosmesis","mechanics-based model","CRISP forward kinematics","CRISP inverse kinematics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759637/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable parallel continuum robots for incisionless surgery","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759637/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503585","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable parallel continuum robots for incisionless surgery","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1603.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076745S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759637","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7759647,"authors":[{"name":"Yixing Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Personal Robotics Lab, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Yixing","lastName":"Gao","id":"37086207679"},{"name":"Hyung Jin Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Personal Robotics Lab, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Hyung Jin","lastName":"Chang","id":"37086207505"},{"name":"Yiannis Demiris","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Personal Robotics Lab, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Yiannis","lastName":"Demiris","id":"37296338900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3761-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"7759647","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":272},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Force","Robot kinematics","Grippers","Force sensors","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["force sensors","handicapped aids","humanoid robots","image sensors","iterative methods","motion estimation","optimisation","pose estimation","robot vision","service robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synthetic data","adaptive moment estimation","stochastic path optimisation","external force resistance","upper-body joints","movement space","human pose recognition","force sensor information","vision sensor information","Baxter humanoid robot","online iterative path optimisation","force information","personalised dressing assistance"]}],"abstract":"We propose an online iterative path optimisation method to enable a Baxter humanoid robot to assist human users to dress.

Whilst most approaches aim to predict the single best grasp pose from an image, our method first predicts a score for every possible grasp pose, which we denote the grasp function. With this, it is possible to achieve grasping robust to the gripper's pose uncertainty, by smoothing the grasp function with the pose uncertainty function. Therefore, if the single best pose is adjacent to a region of poor grasp quality, that pose will no longer be chosen, and instead a pose will be chosen which is surrounded by a region of high grasp quality. To learn this function, we train a Convolutional Neural Network which takes as input a single depth image of an object, and outputs a score for each grasp pose across the image. Training data for this is generated by use of physics simulation and depth image simulation with 3D object meshes, to enable acquisition of sufficient data without requiring exhaustive real-world experiments. We evaluate with both synthetic and real experiments, and show that the learned grasp score is more robust to gripper pose uncertainty than when this uncertainty is not accounted for.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep learning a grasp function for grasping under gripper pose uncertainty","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759657","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759657.pdf","startPage":"4461","endPage":"4468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759657","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759657/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Deep learning a grasp function for grasping under gripper pose uncertainty","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759657/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503691","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep learning a grasp function for grasping under gripper pose uncertainty","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1737.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070943S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7759685,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto Arroyo","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of Alcal\u00e1 (UAH), Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Arroyo","id":"37076408500"},{"name":"Pablo F.

Traditional solutions to this problem are based on the description of images using hand-crafted features, which have been shown to offer moderate invariance against seasonal changes. In this paper, we present a new proposal focused on automatically learned descriptors, which are processed by means of a technique recently popularized in the computer vision community: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The novelty of our approach relies on fusing the image information from multiple convolutional layers at several levels and granularities. In addition, we compress the redundant data of CNN features into a tractable number of bits for efficient and robust place recognition. The final descriptor is reduced by applying simple compression and binarization techniques for fast matching using the Hamming distance. An exhaustive experimental evaluation confirms the improved performance of our proposal (CNN-VTL) with respect to state-of-the-art methods over varied long-term datasets recorded across seasons.","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759685.pdf","startPage":"4656","endPage":"4663","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759685","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fusion and binarization of CNN features for robust topological localization across seasons","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fusion and binarization of CNN features for robust topological localization across seasons","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759685/","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7759685/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503940","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fusion and binarization of CNN features for robust topological localization across seasons","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1451.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089903S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7759711,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Segmentation networks are very large and do not currently run at interactive frame rates. To make this technique applicable to robotics we propose several architecture refinements that provide the best trade-off between segmentation quality and runtime. This is achieved by a new mapping between classes and filters at the expansion side of the network. The network is trained end-to-end and yields precise road/lane predictions at the original input resolution in roughly 50ms. Compared to the state of the art, the network achieves top accuracies on the KITTI dataset for road and lane segmentation while providing a 20\u00d7 speed-up. We demonstrate that the improved efficiency is not due to the road segmentation task. Also on segmentation datasets with larger scene complexity, the accuracy does not suffer from the large speed-up.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759717","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759717.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","startPage":"4885","endPage":"4891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient deep models for monocular road segmentation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759717","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient deep models for monocular road segmentation","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759717/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503561","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7759717/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient deep models for monocular road segmentation","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0439.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081698S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759717","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7759720,"authors":[{"name":"Giulia Pasquale","affiliation":["Laboratory for Computational and Statistical Learning, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Genova, Italy","Dipartimento di Informatica, Universit\u00e1 degli Studi di Genova, Genova, Italy"],"firstName":"Giulia","lastName":"Pasquale","id":"37086099680"},{"name":"Carlo Ciliberto","affiliation":["Poggio Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA","Laboratory for Computational and Statistical Learning, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Genova, Italy"],"firstName":"Carlo","lastName":"Ciliberto","id":"38228801600"},{"name":"Lorenzo Rosasco","affiliation":["Poggio Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA","Laboratory for Computational and Statistical Learning, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Genova, Italy","Dipartimento di Informatica, Universit\u00e1 degli Studi di Genova, Genova, Italy"],"firstName":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Rosasco","id":"37869474900"},{"name":"Lorenzo Natale","affiliation":["iCub Facility, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Genova, Italy"],"firstName":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Natale","id":"37542770000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3761-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"7759720","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":747},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Training","Visualization","Object recognition","Convolution","Context","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image representation","neural nets","object recognition","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object identification","deep convolutional neural network","visual recognition systems","autonomous robotic agents","image representation","object recognition","Web-collected image datasets","invariance property","discriminability property"]}],"abstract":"The development of reliable and robust visual recognition systems is a main challenge towards the deployment of autonomous robotic agents in unconstrained environments. Learning to recognize objects requires image representations that are discriminative to relevant information while being invariant to nuisances, such as scaling, rotations, light and background changes, and so forth. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks can learn such representations from large web-collected image datasets and a natural question is how these systems can be best adapted to the robotics context where little supervision is often available. In this work, we investigate different training strategies for deep architectures on a new dataset collected in a real-world robotic setting. In particular we show how deep networks can be tuned to improve invariance and discriminability properties and perform object identification tasks with minimal supervision.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Object identification from few examples by improving the invariance of a Deep Convolutional Neural Network","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759720","startPage":"4904","endPage":"4911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759720.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759720","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759720/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Object identification from few examples by improving the invariance of a Deep Convolutional Neural Network","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759720/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503732","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Object identification from few examples by improving the invariance of a Deep Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.161474S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759720","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7759722,"authors":[{"name":"Florian Bergner","affiliation":["Institute for Cognitive Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Bergner","id":"37085742718"},{"name":"Emmanuel Dean-Leon","affiliation":["Institute for Cognitive Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Emmanuel","lastName":"Dean-Leon","id":"38271985500"},{"name":"Gordon Cheng","affiliation":["Institute for Cognitive Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Gordon","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37276253300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3761-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"7759722","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":271},"abstract":"In this paper we describe how we realized event-based signaling for large scale artificial robotic skin.

We perform different experiments on our robot TOMM which has two UR5 robot arms, each covered with 260 multi-modal skin cells. Each skin cell samples 9 signals of 4 different modalities. Finally we derive models for extrapolating CPU usage and network traffic for larger numbers of skin cells and higher sample rates. The results show that the event-based system has superior performance and its performance edge increases with larger numbers of skin cells and higher sample rates. Experimental validation on our real robot system shows that in reactive control the event-based system reduces in comparison to the conventional system the packet rate by 48.2% and the CPU usage by 17.79%. We extrapolate the worst case for 5000 cells and show that the event-based system can at least reduce the packet rate by 21.2% and the CPU usage by 17.46%.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Event-based signaling for large-scale artificial robotic skin -

Such emerging interest is pushing the development of effective collision avoidance systems. Such systems play a critical role UAVs operations especially in a crowded airspace setting. Because of cost and weight limitations associated with UAVs payload, camera based technologies are the de-facto choice for collision avoidance navigation systems. This requires multi-target detection and tracking algorithms from a video, which can be run on board efficiently. While there has been a great deal of research on object detection and tracking from a stationary camera, few have attempted to detect and track small UAVs from a moving camera. In this paper, we present a new approach to detect and track UAVs from a single camera mounted on a different UAV. Initially, we estimate background motions via a perspective transformation model and then identify distinctive points in the background subtracted image. We find spatio-temporal traits of each moving object through optical flow matching and then classify those candidate targets based on their motion patterns compared with the background. The performance is boosted through Kalman filter tracking. This results in temporal consistency among the candidate detections. The algorithm was validated on video datasets taken from a UAV. Results show that our algorithm can effectively detect and track small UAVs with limited computing resources.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759733","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759733.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","startPage":"4992","endPage":"4997","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-target detection and tracking from a single camera in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759733","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-target detection and tracking from a single camera in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759733/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503433","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7759733/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-target detection and tracking from a single camera in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0752.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061968S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759733","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7759755,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Hung Dylan Tsai","affiliation":["Department of mechanical engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Japan"],"firstName":"Chia-Hung Dylan","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37075476600"},{"name":"Manh Hao Phan","affiliation":["Department of mechanical engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Japan"],"firstName":"Manh Hao","lastName":"Phan","id":"37086033010"},{"name":"Koji Mizoue","affiliation":["Department of mechanical engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Japan"],"firstName":"Koji","lastName":"Mizoue","id":"37589521100"},{"name":"Makoto Kaneko","affiliation":["Department of mechanical engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Kaneko","id":"37274087200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3761-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"7759755","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759755","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustic waves","Microchannels","Reservoirs","Magnetoacoustic effects","Optical transmitters","Optical surface waves"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic waves","microchannel flow","pulse width modulation","suspensions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unexpected bead alignment","microfluidic channel","suspending microbeads","unintended acoustic wave","standing wave","frequency analyzer","pulse-width-modulation controller","high-frequency signals","wave source","microfluidic applications","acoustic alignment"]}],"abstract":"A surprising phenomenon is observed in a microfluidic channel where suspending microbeads are spontaneously aligned into lines. Microbeads are randomly distributed in the channel at a relatively high velocity (3.27 \u03bcm/ms), but start to align into lines at a relatively low velocity (0.05 \u03bcm/ms). The alignment has been repeated with and without obstacles in the channel. The phenomenon is interpreted as an unintended acoustic wave being around the experimental environment, and the wave resulted in a standing wave which moves the microbeads towards the nodes of the standing wave. By using a frequency analyzer, it is found that a pulse-width-modulation controller in the system generated high-frequency signals, which is the most possible wave source for the alignment. The experimental results are presented, and characteristics of acoustic wave are analyzed. The phenomenon could contribute to microfluidic applications for achieving acoustic alignment without complex fabrication of interdigital transducers.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759755","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759755.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","endPage":"5148","startPage":"5143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unexpected beads alignment in a microfluidic channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759755/","displayDocTitle":"Unexpected beads alignment in a microfluidic channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759755/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16503840","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unexpected beads alignment in a microfluidic channel","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.138159S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759755","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7759768,"authors":[{"name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Largilli\u00e8re","affiliation":["INRIA and University of Lille, Computer Science and Control Laboratory (CRISTAL) joint with CNRS (UMR 9189) and Centrale Lille."],"firstName":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick","lastName":"Largilli\u00e8re","id":"37085493406"},{"name":"Eulalie Coevoet","affiliation":["INRIA and University of Lille, Computer Science and Control Laboratory (CRISTAL) joint with CNRS (UMR 9189) and Centrale Lille."],"firstName":"Eulalie","lastName":"Coevoet","id":"37085480908"},{"name":"Mario Sanz-Lopez","affiliation":["INRIA and University of Lille, Computer Science and Control Laboratory (CRISTAL) joint with CNRS (UMR 9189) and Centrale Lille."],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Sanz-Lopez","id":"37085492863"},{"name":"Laurent Grisoni","affiliation":["INRIA and University of Lille, Computer Science and Control Laboratory (CRISTAL) joint with CNRS (UMR 9189) and Centrale Lille."],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Grisoni","id":"37267269500"},{"name":"Christian Duriez","affiliation":["INRIA and University of Lille, Computer Science and Control Laboratory (CRISTAL) joint with CNRS (UMR 9189) and Centrale Lille."],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Duriez","id":"37428704500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3761-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"7759768","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":218},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force","Rendering (computer graphics)","Haptic interfaces","Finite element analysis","Actuators","Computational modeling","Robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","elastic constants","finite element analysis","haptic interfaces","manipulators","rendering (computer graphics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antagonistic actuation principle","virtual environment","finite element analysis","actuators","stiffness perceptions","mechanical material properties","soft tissues","soft-robotic technology","robotic arm","soft body haptic rendering","FEM simulation","soft tangible devices","stiffness rendering"]}],"abstract":"Haptic rendering of soft bodies is essential in medical simulations of procedures such as surgery or palpation.

We create a tangible deformable device that allows users to \u201ctouch\u201d soft tissues and perceive mechanical material properties, in a realistic manner. The device is able to dynamically provide user touch with different stiffness perceptions, thanks to actuators placed at the boundaries. We introduce a control algorithm, based on inverse Finite Element Analysis, which controls the actuators in order to recreate a desired stiffness that corresponds to the contact with soft tissues in the virtual environment. The approach uses antagonistic actuation principle to create a wide range of stiffness. We validate our algorithm and demonstrate the method using prototypes based on simple mechanisms.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759768","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759768.pdf","startPage":"5224","endPage":"5229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stiffness rendering on soft tangible devices controlled through inverse FEM simulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759768","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759768/","displayDocTitle":"Stiffness rendering on soft tangible devices controlled through inverse FEM simulation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16517763","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759768/","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stiffness rendering on soft tangible devices controlled through inverse FEM simulation","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086029S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759768","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7759777,"authors":[{"name":"Yongliang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA."],"firstName":"Yongliang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085614191"},{"name":"Ning Xi","affiliation":["Emerging Technologies Institute, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, SAR, China."],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Xi","id":"37274126400"},{"name":"Zhiyong Sun","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA."],"firstName":"Zhiyong","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085395655"},{"name":"Marc Basson","affiliation":["School of Medicine and Health Sciences, The University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, ND, USA."],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Basson","id":"37086070007"},{"name":"Bixi Zeng","affiliation":["School of Medicine and Health Sciences, The University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, ND, USA."],"firstName":"Bixi","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37086070026"},{"name":"Bo Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA."],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Song","id":"37400698100"},{"name":"Liangliang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA."],"firstName":"Liangliang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37599648700"},{"name":"Zhanxin Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA."],"firstName":"Zhanxin","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085396534"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3761-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"7759777","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force","Substrates","Probes","Drugs","Nanobioscience","Coatings","Force measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atomic force microscopy","cellular biophysics","drugs","medical robotics","microrobots","nanotechnology","optimisation","proteins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nanorobot enabled in situ sensing molecular interactions","drug discovery process automation","atomic force microscopy based nanorobot","AFM tip","interactive binding force attenuation","AFM based nanorobot","drug candidates","cell signaling pathways","single molecular interaction measurement","substrate coating method","setting optimization","bovine serum albumin","BSA","focal adhesion kinase","FAK","protein kinase B","AKT","cell adhesion"]}],"abstract":"Nanorobot has the potential to automate the manipulation and observation processes at molecular scale.

In this study, we have proposed a nanorobotic manipulation system allowing automated pick-up of CNTs based on visual feedback. We utilize histogram normalization for automatic binarization, and it achieves to clearly distinguish CNTs from substrate and other impurities under different image brightness. Furthermore, we develop the gradient orientation inversion (GOI) algorithm to recognize CNT tip and atomic force microscopy (AFM) cantilever. Taking full advantages of the geometrical characteristics of CNT and AFM cantilever, GOI is proved to be quite robust. We have designed segment detection method (SDM) to successfully separate the AFM cantilever and CNT, whereas the contact detection between them is achieved by analyzing the straightness variation. Preliminary experimental results imply that our method shows high promise in realistic fabrication of nanodevices.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","startPage":"5318","endPage":"5323","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759782.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated pick-up of carbon nanotubes inside a scanning electron microscope","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759782/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7759782/","displayDocTitle":"Automated pick-up of carbon nanotubes inside a scanning electron microscope","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503747","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated pick-up of carbon nanotubes inside a scanning electron microscope","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1600.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092359S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7759784,"authors":[{"name":"Helen Oleynikova","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Lab, ETH, Z\u00fcrich"],"firstName":"Helen","lastName":"Oleynikova","id":"37085472384"},{"name":"Michael Burri","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Lab, ETH, Z\u00fcrich"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Burri","id":"38566149900"},{"name":"Zachary Taylor","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Lab, ETH, Z\u00fcrich"],"firstName":"Zachary","lastName":"Taylor","id":"37085581231"},{"name":"Juan Nieto","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Lab, ETH, Z\u00fcrich"],"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Nieto","id":"37085778635"},{"name":"Roland Siegwart","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Lab, ETH, Z\u00fcrich"],"firstName":"Roland","lastName":"Siegwart","id":"37085367879"},{"name":"Enric Galceran","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Lab, ETH, Z\u00fcrich"],"firstName":"Enric","lastName":"Galceran","id":"37888472200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3761-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"7759784","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":97,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2502},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759784","abstract":"Multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are rapidly gaining popularity for many applications.

In that case, the robot needs to notice when the object successfully moves vs. when the object gets stuck while the finger slips over its surface.

In these applications, each robot collects a large amount of task-specific data that must be sent to the human periodically to keep the human aware of task progress. It is often the case that the human-robot communication links are extremely bandwidth constrained and/or have significantly higher latency than inter-robot communication links, so it is impossible for all robots to send their task-specific data together. Thus, only a subset of robots, which we call the knowledge leaders, can send their data at a time. In this paper, we study the knowledge leader selection problem, where the goal is to select a subset of robots with a given cardinality that transmits the most informative task-specific data for the human. We prove that the knowledge leader selection is a submodular function maximization problem under explicit conditions and present a novel distributed submodular optimization algorithm that has the same approximation guarantees as the centralized greedy algorithm. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated using numerical simulations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Robot kinematics","Optimization","Greedy algorithms","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human-robot interaction","multi-robot systems","numerical analysis","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["numerical simulations","centralized greedy algorithm","approximation guarantees","distributed submodular optimization algorithm","submodular function maximization problem","robot subset","human-robot communication links","task-specific data","task progress monitoring","remote human","multirobot system","bandwidth constraints","multirobot environmental sampling","distributed knowledge leader selection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IROS.2016.7759846","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7743711/7758082/07759846.pdf","startPage":"5751","endPage":"5757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2016.7759846","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed knowledge leader selection for multi-robot environmental sampling under bandwidth constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759846","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed knowledge leader selection for multi-robot environmental sampling under bandwidth constraints","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759846/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759846/","accessionNumber":"16503948","conferenceDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed knowledge leader selection for multi-robot environmental sampling under bandwidth constraints","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1710.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058524S","chronDate":"9-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7743711","isNumber":"7758082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7743711","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7758082","articleId":"7759846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7759878,"authors":[{"name":"V S Rakesh Krishna","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, Rajasthan, India"],"firstName":"V S Rakesh","lastName":"Krishna","id":"37085811029"},{"name":"Rahul Singhal","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, Rajasthan, India"],"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Singhal","id":"38546980400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8975-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-8973-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8976-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-7703"}],"articleNumber":"7759878","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber dispersion","Optical fiber networks","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Optical fiber theory","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fibre networks","optical links","optical modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio-over-fibre","subcarrier multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadrature amplitude modulated signal","hybrid radio-over fiber network","fiber link","16QAM signal","64QAM signal","optical single side band generation technique","OSSB generation technique","dual carrier multiplexing architecture","multiservice transmission","heterogeneous network","centralized control","centralized processing","subcarrier multiplexing technique","SCM technique","next-generation hybrid network","DCM M-QAM signal modulated optical SSB transmission over fiber"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hybrid Radio over fiber","QAM","OSSB","DCM","Heterogenous networks"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a simple hybrid radio-over fiber network that can transmit a different quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) signals simultaneously over a 50-km fiber link is investigated.

HT alters the normal working of IC, can leak the secret information or may damage the IC permanently. Due to the small size of the devices on IC, detection of trojan is very difficult by normal testing methods. In this paper, a side channel based trojan detection technique using power analysis is used to detect the trojan infected IC. Here a trust-hub test bench circuit is used to validate trojan detection technique in which the Trojan is inserted on AES-128 bit crypto core. The trojan detection is improved by analyzing the power of IC without trojan (Golden model) and IC with trojan (Trojan model) and by comparing the mean of power traces of both the IC. Statistical data analysis is performed and statistical parameters of power are calculated which are then used as feature vectors. These feature vectors are reduced by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm and then classified using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) which discriminates between the Golden and Trojan model and detects the trojan infected IC from the IC under test with 100% accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/WOCN.2016.7759894","publicationTitle":"2016 Thirteenth International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks (WOCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Thirteenth International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks (WOCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7746833/7759014/07759894.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCN.2016.7759894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7759014","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A side channel based power analysis technique for hardware trojan detection using statistical learning approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759894","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759894/","displayDocTitle":"A side channel based power analysis technique for hardware trojan detection using statistical learning approach","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16504431","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759894/","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A side channel based power analysis technique for hardware trojan detection using statistical learning approach","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"s416.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054152S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7746833","isNumber":"7759014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7746833","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7759014","articleId":"7759894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7759895,"authors":[{"name":"Jayashree Agarkhed","affiliation":["Poojya Doddappa Appa College of Engineering, Gulbarga, Karnataka, IN"],"firstName":"Jayashree","lastName":"Agarkhed"},{"name":"Neema Joshi","affiliation":["Poojya Doddappa Appa College of Engineering, Gulbarga, Karnataka, IN"],"firstName":"Neema","lastName":"Joshi"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8975-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-8973-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8976-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-7703"}],"articleNumber":"7759895","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Cognitive radio","Biomedical monitoring","Sensors","Temperature measurement","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio transceivers","wireless channels","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio sensing integration","wireless sensor network","wireless communication","transceiver","channel availability detection","cognitive radio sensor network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wireless sensor network","cognitive radio","cognitive radio wireless sensor network","channel assignment","energy efficiency","scalability","routing protocols for cognitive radio"]}],"abstract":"Sensors are widely in use because of low cost and multi functionality.

The performance evaluation was evaluated in an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) model. Moreover, the performance evaluation was carried out using other adaptive algorithms beside the FEDS. These are LMS, NLMS, and RLS algorithms. The simulation results of adaptive beamforming with eight elements in the array showed that the best window length parameter (L) is ten and when the window length parameter (L) has increased more than ten or less, then the performance begins to deteriorate. In addition, the FEDS had better performance in terms of interference suppression capability, minimum Mean Square coefficients Deviation (MSD) and minimum Mean Square Error (MSE) compared with LMS, NLMS algorithms and similar to the RLS algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 May 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16504319","htmlLink":"/document/7759916/","conferenceDate":"9-10 May 2016","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of the fast euclidean direction search algorithm for adaptive beamforming applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of the fast euclidean direction search algorithm for adaptive beamforming applications","confLoc":"Baghdad, Iraq","sourcePdf":"17PerformanceEvaluationThamer6p.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.192626S","chronDate":"9-10 May 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7746775","isNumber":"7759899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7746775","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7759899","articleId":"7759916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7759925,"authors":[{"name":"Adheed H.

In the proposed scheme, the original image is first decomposed by LWT into four subbands. Then the robust watermark which is a binary logo image is decomposed by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) as such only the high frequency subband of the watermark are embedded in the low frequency subband of the original image. The fragile watermark is block wise self-generated from the original image and scrambled using Arnold transform which is later embedded in the spatial domain of the robust watermarked image. Self-generated fragile watermark supports self-authentication with high localization, whereas scrambling the fragile watermark increases the security of the algorithm. On the other hand, the lifting scheme approaches have almost one half the amounts of operations compared to the DWT based approaches. The overall system has been tested against various attacks and the results demonstrated that the robust watermark can be decoded successively under each attack. In addition, the proposed algorithm can detect any tampering attempts.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Al-Sadeq International Conference on Multidisciplinary in IT and Communication Science and Applications (AIC-MITCSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7746775/7759899/07759937.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2016 Al-Sadeq International Conference on Multidisciplinary in IT and Communication Science and Applications (AIC-MITCSA)","doi":"10.1109/AIC-MITCSA.2016.7759937","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIC-MITCSA.2016.7759937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7759899","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759937","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-purpose watermarking scheme based on hybrid of lifting wavelet transform and Arnold transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Robustness","Discrete wavelet transforms","Copyright protection","Authentication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["copy protection","discrete wavelet transforms","image coding","image watermarking","message authentication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image watermarking scheme","lifting wavelet transform","LWT","Arnold transform","copyright protection","image authentication","discrete wavelet transform","DWT"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["robust watermark","fragile watermark","multipurpose watermarking system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759937/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 May 2016","displayDocTitle":"A multi-purpose watermarking scheme based on hybrid of lifting wavelet transform and Arnold transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759937/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"16504307","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"9-10 May 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-purpose watermarking scheme based on hybrid of lifting wavelet transform and Arnold transform","confLoc":"Baghdad, Iraq","sourcePdf":"38MultipurposeWatermarkNidaa6p.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064514S","chronDate":"9-10 May 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7746775","isNumber":"7759899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7746775","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7759899","articleId":"7759937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7759939,"authors":[{"name":"Hameed R.

In this paper, an intelligent clustering protocol is proposed to minimize energy consumption and prolong network lifetime. The proposed protocol performs clustering with dynamic number of clusters depending on the nodes distribution and the field dimensions. The process of selecting the optimum number of clusters and electing the suitable cluster heads (CH) is done by using modified genetic algorithm. This work proposed a method to modify the genetic algorithm. The target of the genetic algorithm (fitness function) is to minimize the total energy consumed by all nodes in the round. Balancing the residual energy between the nodes is an important factor to prolong network lifetime. To ensure balancing in the sensors network, an energy filter was proposed to block low energy nodes from acting as cluster heads and select the remaining nodes as candidate CHs then the modified genetic system chooses the optimum CHs from the candidate CHs. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperform the common clustering protocol in terms of network lifetime and energy consumption.","doi":"10.1109/AIC-MITCSA.2016.7759947","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Al-Sadeq International Conference on Multidisciplinary in IT and Communication Science and Applications (AIC-MITCSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7746775/7759899/07759947.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 Al-Sadeq International Conference on Multidisciplinary in IT and Communication Science and Applications (AIC-MITCSA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIC-MITCSA.2016.7759947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7759899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimizing energy consumption in wireless sensor networks using modified genetic algorithm and an energy balance filter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Genetic algorithms","Filtering algorithms","Sensors","Mathematical model","Wireless sensor networks","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","genetic algorithms","minimisation","pattern clustering","power consumption","protocols","telecommunication power management","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor network","genetic algorithm","energy balance filter","power consumption reduction","base station","BS","intelligent clustering protocol model","energy consumption minimization","network lifetime prolongation","nodes distribution","cluster head","CH","residual energy balancing","remaining node selection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WSN clustering","genetic algorithm","energy balance filter","optimum number of CH"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759947/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 May 2016","displayDocTitle":"Minimizing energy consumption in wireless sensor networks using modified genetic algorithm and an energy balance filter","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759947/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"9-10 May 2016","accessionNumber":"16504321","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimizing energy consumption in wireless sensor networks using modified genetic algorithm and an energy balance filter","confLoc":"Baghdad, Iraq","sourcePdf":"48MinimizingEnergyConsumZainab6p.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059784S","chronDate":"9-10 May 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7746775","isNumber":"7759899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7746775","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7759899","articleId":"7759947","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7759948,"authors":[{"name":"Haider A.

In these networks, significant part of the energy is consumed in the energy detector during spectrum sensing for possible vacancy for secondary user transmission. In this paper, we have investigated reducing the energy consumption of single cognitive user (CU) by reducing the number of sensed samples. Also we have explained the optimization criteria for improving energy consumption by controlling number of sensed samples, detection probability and threshold of energy detector. The performance of energy detection system is evaluated in AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels. The simulation results show that at Eb/No of 10 dB 50% and 46 % of the energy consumed in detection are saved when the number of sensed samples is reduced by 50% with acceptable loss in detection probability of 5% and 12% in AWGN and Rayleigh channel respectively. The results also shows the impact of changing the threshold of energy detector on energy consumed in spectrum sensing.","doi":"10.1109/AIC-MITCSA.2016.7759954","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Al-Sadeq International Conference on Multidisciplinary in IT and Communication Science and Applications (AIC-MITCSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7746775/7759899/07759954.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7759899","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIC-MITCSA.2016.7759954","publicationTitle":"2016 Al-Sadeq International Conference on Multidisciplinary in IT and Communication Science and Applications (AIC-MITCSA)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvement of energy consumption in cognitive radio by reducing the number of sensed samples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7759954","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 May 2016","displayDocTitle":"Improvement of energy consumption in cognitive radio by reducing the number of sensed samples","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759954/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759954/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"16504359","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"9-10 May 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvement of energy consumption in cognitive radio by reducing the number of sensed samples","confLoc":"Baghdad, Iraq","sourcePdf":"55ImprovementofEnergyHadeel6p.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046995S","chronDate":"9-10 May 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7746775","isNumber":"7759899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7746775","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7759899","articleId":"7759954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7759984,"authors":[{"name":"Animesh Kumar Paul","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Khulna University of Engineering and Technology, Khulna, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Animesh Kumar","lastName":"Paul","id":"37085556297"},{"name":"Pintu Chandra Shill","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Khulna University of Engineering and Technology, Khulna, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Pintu Chandra","lastName":"Shill","id":"38234567100"},{"name":"Md.

In many cases, not all the expert's experiences contribute towards effective diagnosis of a disease. Researchers have taken multiple approaches like attribute reduction, rule extraction, fuzzy model optimization, etc. But noisy data in datasets, irrelevant attributes, and lack of effective fuzzy rules are major hindrances to provide best decision. In this study, we propose genetic algorithm based fuzzy decision support system for predicting the risk level of heart disease. Our proposed fuzzy decision support system (FDSS) works as follows: i) Preprocess the dataset, ii) Effective attributes are selected based on different methods, iii) Weighted fuzzy rules are generated on the basis of selected attributes using GA, iv) Build the FDSS from the generated fuzzy knowledge base, v) Predict the heart disease. The experiments carried out with real-life data set show the effectiveness of this proposed innovative approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 May 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7759984/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16539920","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7759984/","publicationDate":"May 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"13-14 May 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm based fuzzy decision support system for the diagnosis of heart disease","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm based fuzzy decision support system for the diagnosis of heart disease","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053635S","chronDate":"13-14 May 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7746853","isNumber":"7759964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7746853","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7759964","articleId":"7759984","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"}]
