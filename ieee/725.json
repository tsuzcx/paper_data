Compared with pure temporal processes, the identification of spatio-temporal models from observed images is much more difficult and quite challenging. Starting with an assumption that there is no a priori information about the true model but only observed data are available, this work introduces a new type of wavelet network that utilizes the easy tractability and exploits the good properties of multiscale wavelet decompositions to represent the rules of the associated spatio-temporal evolutionary system. An application to a chemical reaction exhibiting a spatio-temporal evolutionary behaviour, is investigated to demonstrate the application of the proposed modeling and learning approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSE.2015.7250228","startPage":"119","endPage":"124","publicationTitle":"2015 10th International Conference on Computer Science & Education (ICCSE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSE.2015.7250228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7250193","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 10th International Conference on Computer Science & Education (ICCSE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7222823/7250193/07250228.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wavelet neural network model for spatio-temporal image processing and modeling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7250228/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A wavelet neural network model for spatio-temporal image processing and modeling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7250228/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15437050","publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"22-24 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 July 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wavelet neural network model for spatio-temporal image processing and modeling","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"02114120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074246S","chronDate":"22-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7222823","isNumber":"7250193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7222823","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7250193","articleId":"7250228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7250229,"authors":[{"name":"Hua-Liang Wei","affiliation":["The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, Sheffield, GB"],"firstName":"Hua-Liang","lastName":"Wei","id":"37423982100"},{"name":"Michael A.

The proposed model has the following advantages. It is known that linear models are transparent and easily interpretable, the inclusion of a linear submodel can therefore determine how the overall evolution trend of the system behavior (output or response) depends on the system input (or dependent) variables. On the other hand, the inclusion of the ridge basis functions enables the identification of nonlinearities that cannot be revealed by linear models and thus can improve the overall prediction performance. The proposed network is applied to a real data modeling task in relation to the relativistic electron flux intensity prediction in space weather study, and relevant performance of the network is presented.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSE.2015.7250229","startPage":"125","endPage":"130","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 10th International Conference on Computer Science & Education (ICCSE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7222823/7250193/07250229.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 10th International Conference on Computer Science & Education (ICCSE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSE.2015.7250229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7250193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new ridge basis function neural network for data-driven modeling and prediction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data models","Predictive models","Neural networks","Training","Meteorology","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","data models","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ridge basis function neural network","data-driven modeling","data-driven prediction","RiBFNN","ridge basis function submodel","linear submodel","system input variables","real data modeling task","relativistic electron flux intensity prediction","space weather","data analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ridge basis functions","neural networks","data-driven modeling","system identification","space weather"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7250229/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"A new ridge basis function neural network for data-driven modeling and prediction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7250229/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"22-24 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15437129","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new ridge basis function neural network for data-driven modeling and prediction","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"02214118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086499S","chronDate":"22-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7222823","isNumber":"7250193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7222823","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7250193","articleId":"7250229","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7250260,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Li","id":"37085352174"},{"name":"Jiong Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37407601100"},{"name":"Xin Ren","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Ren","id":"37085653434"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6600-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6598-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6599-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7250260","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Software","Multicore processing","Education","Algorithm design and analysis","Parallel programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["C language","computer science education","educational courses","electronic engineering education","field programmable gate arrays","multiprocessing systems","parallel architectures","parallel programming","program compilers","teaching","travelling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["teaching","FPGA-based multicore parallel computing course","token ring","tool chains","C code compilation","executable object code","parallel programming solutions","TSP","travel salesman problem","parallel architecture","synchronization","message","shared memory","software skills","hardware skills","HDL designi","MIT course","Multicore Systems Laboratory","multicore system architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-core","FPGA","Beehive","TSP"]}],"abstract":"Multicore related courses delivered or several years in universities, while mostly were parallel programming or just simulation with desktop software.

Exploiting a large number of programmable switches, routing structures are mainly responsible for the performance limitation. Hence, employing more efficient switches can drastically improve the performance and reduce the power consumption of the FPGA. Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM)-based switches are one of the most promising candidates to improve the FPGA routing architecture thanks to their low on-resistance and non-volatility. The lower RC delay of RRAM-based routing multiplexers, as compared to CMOS-based routing structures encourages us to reconsider the buffer distribution in FPGAs. This paper proposes an approach to reduce the number of buffers in the routing path of RRAM-based FPGAs. Our architectural simulations show that the use of RRAM switches improves the critical path delay by 56% as compared to CMOS switches in standard FPGA circuits at 45-nm technology node while, at the same time, the area and power are reduced, respectively, by 17% and 9%. By adapting the buffering scheme, an extra bonus of 9% for delay reduction, 5% for power reduction and 16% for area reduction can be obtained, as compared to the conventional buffering approach for RRAM-based FPGAs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Routing","Delays","Switches","Multiplexing","Integrated circuit modeling","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","buffer circuits","CMOS logic circuits","CMOS memory circuits","delay circuits","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","low-power electronics","multiplexing equipment","network routing","RC circuits","resistive RAM","switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["area reduction","power reduction","delay reduction","buffering scheme","FPGA circuits","CMOS switches","path delay","routing path","CMOS-based routing structures","RRAM-based routing multiplexers","RC delay","FPGA routing architecture","programmable switches","power consumption","ASIC","application-specific integrated circuits","FPGA routing structures","field programmable gate arrays","RRAM-based switches","resistive random access memory","buffer distribution","size 45 nm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7250433","doi":"10.1109/LASCAS.2015.7250433","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 6th Latin American Symposium on Circuits & Systems (LASCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7235122/7250401/07250433.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LASCAS.2015.7250433","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7250401","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 6th Latin American Symposium on Circuits & Systems (LASCAS)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study on buffer distribution for RRAM-based FPGA routing structures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A study on buffer distribution for RRAM-based FPGA routing structures","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7250433/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Feb. 2015","conferenceDate":"24-27 Feb. 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7250433/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"15452307","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study on buffer distribution for RRAM-based FPGA routing structures","confLoc":"Montevideo, Uruguay","sourcePdf":"ID049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07694S","chronDate":"24-27 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7235122","isNumber":"7250401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7235122","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7250401","articleId":"7250433","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":7250438,"authors":[{"name":"Giorgio Lopez","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology Engineering, University of Napoli \u201cFederico II\u201d, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Giorgio","lastName":"Lopez","id":"37085398942"},{"name":"Ettore Napoli","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology Engineering, University of Napoli \u201cFederico II\u201d, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Ettore","lastName":"Napoli","id":"37268558100"},{"name":"Antonio G.M.

The basic SLSC system, including encoder, decoder, spectrum, and resolution, is described. An alternate method of encoding the chrominance is introduced that markedly decreases luminance/chrominance crosstalk. Three methods of increasing the aspect ratio from 4:3 to at least 5:3 are presented.

In contrast to the conventional WL processing approach, the properties of the augmented covariance matrix are exploited to derive a new structured WL beamforming scheme based on the generalized sidelobe canceler (GSC) structure. We develop a recursive least square (RLS) algorithm according to the constrained constant modulus (CCM) criterion to update the reduced-rank beamformer so obtained. A detailed signal-to-interference-plus noise ratio (SINR) analysis and a computational complexity analysis are carried out.

However, most well-known signal parameter estimation algorithms assume that the receiver has access to the observations data with infinite precision. In this paper, we investigate a method to improve the performance of covariance based algorithms that operate on quantized signals. To this end, we use a particular transformation between the input and output second order statistics when affected by non-linear processing. By applying this transformation, we could then utilize standard algorithms with almost no additional complexity. The introduced method is also of particular interest in the context of adaptive signal processing, since many adaptive processing algorithms are based on estimating the received signal covariance matrices. Through simulations, we show that the method is capable of improving the estimation performance especially in the extreme case of one-bit quantization.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227493/7251315/07251323.pdf","startPage":"19","endPage":"23","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7251315","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7251323","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Covariance based signal parameter estimation of coarse quantized signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","Covariance matrices","Receivers","Estimation","Correlation","MIMO","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal processing","analogue-digital conversion","antenna arrays","covariance matrices","higher order statistics","quantisation (signal)","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["one-bit quantization","received signal covariance matrices","adaptive signal processing","nonlinear processing","second order statistics","massive multiple antenna","power consumption reduction","complexity reduction","low resolution analog-to-digital converter","coarse signal quantization","covariance based signal parameter estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7251323/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Covariance based signal parameter estimation of coarse quantized signals","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7251323/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15452007","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"21-24 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Covariance based signal parameter estimation of coarse quantized signals","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"We315P0546.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061218S","chronDate":"21-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227493","isNumber":"7251315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227493","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7251315","articleId":"7251323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7251336,"authors":[{"name":"Elena Sobotta","affiliation":["Circuit Design and Network Theory Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Elena","lastName":"Sobotta","id":"37074113900"},{"name":"Robert Wolf","affiliation":["Circuit Design and Network Theory Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Wolf","id":"38267403700"},{"name":"Niko Joram","affiliation":["Circuit Design and Network Theory Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Niko","lastName":"Joram","id":"37547359200"},{"name":"Frank Ellinger","affiliation":["Circuit Design and Network Theory Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Ellinger","id":"37275628500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8229-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8228-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7251336","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":776},"abstract":"A broadband variable gain amplifier (VGA) with low phase variation versus control range is presented in this work.

Analog circuits of a given circuit class are classified in a topology tree, where each node represents a specific topology. Child nodes evolve from their parent nodes by an enhancement of the parent node's topological structure. Topology selection is performed by a depth-first-search in the topology tree starting at the root node, thus checking topologies of increasing complexity. The decisions at each node are based on solving equations or - if this is not possible - on simulations. The search ends at the first (and thus the simplest) topology which can meet the specification after an adequate circuit sizing. The advantages of the generic, tree based topology selection method presented in this paper are shown in comparison to a pool selection method and to heuristic approaches.

The basic building block is based on chopping technique which has been used to control the charge integrated in the device in order to avoid drift effects. By doing this, the memristance value can be preserved, thus obtaining a programmable resistance that can be used in several circuital configurations. Its minimum size is orders of magnitude less than that of a standard resistor implemented in CMOS, which means a significant reduction in silicon area. Moreover, the memristance can be easily programmed through digital pulses. The functionality of the comparator has been simulated.

TIA is one of the most frequent module adopted in biological and environmental sensing such as hall sensors and DNA synthesis detection, which require noise density down to sub-pA/\u221aHz with micro-watt power consumption so detailed analysis on the noise performance is required. The noises for three different TIAs, including the common-gate topology, op-amp based resistive feedback and capacitive feedback, have been investigated and simulated. Among them, op-amp based capacitive feedback, which bases on integration of input current, displays the lowest noise and best performance. Simulated in 180 nm CMOS process, the capacitive feedback technology shows an input-referred noise of 16 fA/\u221aHz (80 fA/\u221aHz) at 10 kHz (100 Hz), featuring it a promising solution for current detection.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7251078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PRIME.2015.7251392","publicationTitle":"2015 11th Conference on Ph.D. Research in Microelectronics and Electronics (PRIME)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 11th Conference on Ph.D. Research in Microelectronics and Electronics (PRIME)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7231142/7251078/07251392.pdf","startPage":"290","endPage":"293","doi":"10.1109/PRIME.2015.7251392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring the noise limits of fully-differential micro-watt transimpedance amplifiers for Sub-pA/yHz sensitivity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Exploring the noise limits of fully-differential micro-watt transimpedance amplifiers for Sub-pA/yHz sensitivity","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7251392/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15494184","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7251392/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring the noise limits of fully-differential micro-watt transimpedance amplifiers for Sub-pA/yHz sensitivity","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"74.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043763S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7231142","isNumber":"7251078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7231142","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7251078","articleId":"7251392","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7251393,"authors":[{"name":"Avinash S.

The amount of data handled in a typical beamforming block of an ultrasound imaging system is considerably large due to substantial number of transducers. Consequently, computational power required will be huge as is the foot-print of complete system. Recently, in order to cut down these requirements, reduction in sampling rate of the system is being achieved through compressive sensing techniques. One such technique is Finite Rate of Innovation framework. In this paper, authors make use of this framework and Fresnel concept to propose a compressed Fresnel beamformer aimed at reducing the hardware complexity and also communication cost. The results obtained show a significant reduction in sampling rate required for the complete system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7251393/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15439288","htmlLink":"/document/7251393/","conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Compressed Fresnel beamformer for portable ultrasound imaging system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed Fresnel beamformer for portable ultrasound imaging system","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"75.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057926S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7231142","isNumber":"7251078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7231142","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7251078","articleId":"7251393","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7251399,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Ibrahim","affiliation":["Microelectronics Research Lab, Lebanese University, Beirut, Lebanon","DITEN, University of Genova, Genova, Italy"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Ibrahim","id":"37085352701"},{"name":"Maurizio Valle","affiliation":["DITEN, University of Genova, Genova, Italy"],"firstName":"Maurizio","lastName":"Valle","id":"37085357297"},{"name":"Luca Noli","affiliation":["DITEN, University of Genova, Genova, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Noli","id":"37085342538"},{"name":"Hussein Chible","affiliation":["Microelectronics Research Lab, Lebanese University, Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Hussein","lastName":"Chible","id":"37372205000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8229-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8228-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7251399","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":370},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jacobian matrices","Field programmable gate arrays","Symmetric matrices","Matrix decomposition","Hardware","Kernel","Singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","fixed point arithmetic","haptic interfaces","singular value decomposition","skin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","CORDIC-SVD","singular value decomposition","fixed point arithmetic","e-skin system","electronic skin","tactile information processing","sensor input matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Real time FPGA implementation","Singular Value Decomposition","CORDIC modules","Tensorial Kernel","E-skin"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7251399","abstract":"In this paper we present a CORDIC based FPGA implementation of Singular Value Decomposition for real time tactile information processing.

An asynchronous FIR filter with 4 phase bundled data handshake protocol is presented with and without power shutoff. Implementation is done in 90nm CMOS and simulations performed at 600mV with different input data rates and the total energy consumption recorded. It was noted that at lower data rates, the circuit design with fine grained power gating is energy efficient while at higher data rates it consumes more energy than one without power gating.

The proposed solution leads to a classification of objects grasped by multiple manipulators.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7251453/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15439448","publicationDate":"July 2015","conferenceDate":"27-31 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7251453/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic modeling of cooperative robots holding flexible objects","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic modeling of cooperative robots holding flexible objects","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"Paper029ID76Long3719513.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068486S","chronDate":"27-31 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7235771","isNumber":"7251419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7235771","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7251419","articleId":"7251453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7251485,"authors":[{"name":"P\u00e9ter Fankhauser","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Autonomous Systems Lab, Switzerland"],"firstName":"P\u00e9ter","lastName":"Fankhauser","id":"37085347563"},{"name":"Michael Bloesch","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Autonomous Systems Lab, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Bloesch","id":"37077142100"},{"name":"Diego Rodriguez","affiliation":["Robotics and Embedded Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany","ETH Zurich, Autonomous Systems Lab, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Diego","lastName":"Rodriguez","id":"37085732429"},{"name":"Ralf Kaestner","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Autonomous Systems Lab, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Ralf","lastName":"Kaestner","id":"38252370100"},{"name":"Marco Hutter","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Autonomous Systems Lab, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Hutter","id":"37545251000"},{"name":"Roland Siegwart","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Autonomous Systems Lab, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Roland","lastName":"Siegwart","id":"37085367879"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7509-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7508-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7251485","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":117,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3820},"abstract":"With the introduction of the Microsoft Kinect for Windows v2 (Kinect v2), an exciting new sensor is available to robotics and computer vision researchers. Similar to the original Kinect, the sensor is capable of acquiring accurate depth images at high rates. This is useful for robot navigation as dense and robust maps of the environment can be created. Opposed to the original Kinect working with the structured light technology, the Kinect v2 is based on the time-of-flight measurement principle and might also be used outdoors in sunlight. In this paper, we evaluate the application of the Kinect v2 depth sensor for mobile robot navigation. The results of calibrating the intrinsic camera parameters are presented and the minimal range of the depth sensor is examined. We analyze the data quality of the measurements for indoors and outdoors in overcast and direct sunlight situations. To this end, we introduce empirically derived noise models for the Kinect v2 sensor in both axial and lateral directions. The noise models take the measurement distance, the angle of the observed surface, and the sunlight incidence angle into account. These models can be used in post-processing to filter the Kinect v2 depth images for a variety of applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7235771/7251419/07251485.pdf","startPage":"388","endPage":"394","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR)","doi":"10.1109/ICAR.2015.7251485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAR.2015.7251485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7251419","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7251485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kinect v2 for mobile robot navigation: Evaluation and modeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Robot sensing systems","Cameras","Shadow mapping","Noise measurement","Standards","Measurement uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image filtering","image sensors","interactive devices","mobile robots","path planning","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kinect v2 depth sensor","mobile robot navigation","computer vision","camera parameter calibration","depth image filtering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7251485/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Kinect v2 for mobile robot navigation: Evaluation and modeling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7251485/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15439414","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","conferenceDate":"27-31 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kinect v2 for mobile robot navigation: Evaluation and modeling","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"Paper061ID152Fankhauser3733197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056315S","chronDate":"27-31 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7235771","isNumber":"7251419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7235771","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"7251419","articleId":"7251485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7251504,"authors":[{"name":"Berk Calli","affiliation":["Dep. of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Berk","lastName":"Calli","id":"37681653300"},{"name":"Arjun Singh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Arjun","lastName":"Singh","id":"37534702000"},{"name":"Aaron Walsman","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Aaron","lastName":"Walsman","id":"37085357749"},{"name":"Siddhartha Srinivasa","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Siddhartha","lastName":"Srinivasa","id":"37339877600"},{"name":"Pieter Abbeel","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Pieter","lastName":"Abbeel","id":"37542877900"},{"name":"Aaron M.

In the proposed method, the radar signals are recovered using a joint Bayesian sparse representation, and the estimated coefficients are transformed into a third-order data tensor. Then, higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) is applied to form a multilinear wall subspace. To remove the returns associated with wall clutter, the radar signal is projected onto the complement of the wall subspace. Furthermore, a compact image formation model is developed using principal component analysis (PCA), which yields a smaller dictionary size and reduced noise.

Specifically, Ray-Tracing, a well-known physically-based rendering algorithm, has been receiving great attentions in research and development with the evolution of multi-core architecture since massive parallelism is inherent in that application. Unfortunately, the type of computation in Ray-tracing is known as an instance of irregular application which possesses attributes that may vary during execution and are often unpredictable, making it difficult to run efficiently on SIMD/SIMT based GPGPU architectures. For example, the irregularity in such applications may cause control flow divergence, load imbalance and low efficiency in the memory hierarchy of heterogeneous computing systems. To address these issues, researchers have been trying different approaches such as MIMD based homogeneous platform or specific hardware solutions. While these approaches tend to emphasize on dedicated special-purpose hardware configurations, our work illustrates that with appropriate analysis and tuning for irregularity within Ray-Tracing, it is possible to achieve high performance and high efficiency on current heterogeneous systems by applying software-based runtime approach. We studied and proposed phase guided dynamic work partitioning, a light-weight and fast analysis technique, to collect information during program phases at runtime in order to guide work partitioning in subsequent phases for more efficient work dispatching on heterogeneous systems. The experiments have shown that the performance gain of this approach can be as high as 5 times faster than the original system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Runtime techniques for efficient Ray-Tracing on heterogeneous systems","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251838","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227493/7251315/07251838.pdf","startPage":"100","endPage":"104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7251315","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7251838","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7251838/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Runtime techniques for efficient Ray-Tracing on heterogeneous systems","conferenceDate":"21-24 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7251838/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15452069","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Runtime techniques for efficient Ray-Tracing on heterogeneous systems","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"We351P0549.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097909S","chronDate":"21-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227493","isNumber":"7251315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227493","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7251315","articleId":"7251838","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7251845,"authors":[{"name":"Theerasak Chanwimalueang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Theerasak","lastName":"Chanwimalueang","id":"37570022900"},{"name":"Wilhelm von Rosenberg","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Wilhelm","lastName":"von Rosenberg","id":"37085550343"},{"name":"Danilo P.

Such recorded ECG data are typically contaminated by noise, motion artefacts, unbalanced skin-electrode impedance and other physiological signals. These affect the quality of R-peak detection and can consequently lead to failure in the evaluation of physiological functions or a misinterpretation of the state of the body, such as in monitoring stress. While numerous methods for R-peak detection are available for stationary and comparably noise-free ECG, robust DSP software for wearable devices is still emerging. To this end, a new approach which combines matched filtering and Hilbert transform is proposed. The RR-intervals and cross-correlation are used in conjunction to not only automatically locate the R-peaks but also to display the candidate ambiguous peaks via an interactive graphical user interface. The performance of the proposed approach is compared to the well-known Pan-Tompkins algorithm and is evaluated for two types of ECG databases: standard stationary data and low-SNR ECG data obtained from wearable ECG. The proposed method results in a distinctly higher positive predictivity and leads to more satisfying overall outcomes, especially for the critical call of low-SNR data.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Transforms","Databases","Biomedical monitoring","Software","Heart rate variability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrocardiography","Hilbert transforms","matched filters","medical signal detection","medical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["enabling R-peak detection","wearable ECG","matched filtering","Hilbert transform","motion artefacts","unbalanced skin-electrode impedance","interactive graphical user interface","Pan-Tompkins algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["R-peak detection","RR-interval","ECG","QRS detection","matched filtering","Hilbert transform","wearable devices"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7251315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251845","startPage":"134","endPage":"138","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227493/7251315/07251845.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251845","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enabling R-peak detection in wearable ECG: Combining matched filtering and Hilbert transform","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Enabling R-peak detection in wearable ECG: Combining matched filtering and Hilbert transform","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15438622","publicationDate":"July 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7251845/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7251845/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enabling R-peak detection in wearable ECG: Combining matched filtering and Hilbert transform","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"We363P0634.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065954S","chronDate":"21-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227493","isNumber":"7251315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227493","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7251315","articleId":"7251845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7251851,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Empirical wavelet transform (EWT), an adaptive technique for analyzing non-stationary signals, is employed in the pre-processing stage for suppression of noise in speech signals. In this work, multi-level local patterns (MLP), modified version of 1D-local binary patterns (LBP) are used as features. Multi-level local patterns capture the local variations in non-stationary signal by performing comparisons in neighborhood of a sample. Finally, the comparative information thus generated is encoded into multiple states and histogram of MLPs corresponding to short segments of speech signal is computed. Nearest neighbor classifier utilizes the histogram features for classification of speech segments. Experimental evaluation of proposed approach is carried out on the publicly available CMU-Arctic database. The results of our experiments show improvement in classification accuracy with the use of EWT. Further, the MLP based approach clearly yields superior performance than the LBP based approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251851","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227493/7251315/07251851.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7251315","startPage":"163","endPage":"167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of voiced and non-voiced speech signals using empirical wavelet transform and multi-level local patterns","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7251851","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Classification of voiced and non-voiced speech signals using empirical wavelet transform and multi-level local patterns","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7251851/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 July 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15452085","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7251851/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of voiced and non-voiced speech signals using empirical wavelet transform and multi-level local patterns","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"We414P0467.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052456S","chronDate":"21-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227493","isNumber":"7251315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227493","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7251315","articleId":"7251851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7251855,"authors":[{"name":"Wen Bin Ye","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Wen Bin","lastName":"Ye","id":"37085845088"},{"name":"Ya Jun Yu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Ya Jun","lastName":"Yu","id":"37422281600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8058-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8057-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-3577"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1546-1874"}],"articleNumber":"7251855","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filters","Interpolation","Read only memory","Power demand","Convolution","Speech"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","FIR filters","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["classic digital signal processing","shannon sampling theory","level-crossing sampling scheme","asynchronous analog-to-digital converter","AADC","power consumption","finite impulse response filtering technique","FIR filtering technique","nonuniform sampled data","computation complexity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7251855","abstract":"The classic digital signal processing based on shannon sampling theory uniformly samples signals without making use of their intrinsic properties.

In this work, we study all these three estimation problems with consideration of quantization effects. Although the quantization effect does degrade the performance of all these three estimation problems, SOE outperforms SupE which is then better than SigE in terms of achieving the better estimation performance given the same acquisition costs or consuming the smaller number of measurements required to reach the same estimation probability. This is due to an important fact that SOE needs to retrieve the least amount of information content compared with SupE and SigE, which therefore alludes to its highest estimation performance and acquisition efficiency. Such an observation can shed lights on the implementation of practical CS-based applications, in which one can decide the acquisition costs based on the amount of information needed to be recovered.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information estimations and acquisition costs for quantized compressive sensing","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251865","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227493/7251315/07251865.pdf","startPage":"229","endPage":"233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7251315","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7251865","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7251865/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Information estimations and acquisition costs for quantized compressive sensing","conferenceDate":"21-24 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7251865/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15438689","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information estimations and acquisition costs for quantized compressive sensing","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"We443P0338.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083614S","chronDate":"21-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227493","isNumber":"7251315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227493","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7251315","articleId":"7251865","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7251866,"authors":[{"name":"Shengyao Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Nanjing University of Science & Technology, Nanjing, People's Republic of China"],"firstName":"Shengyao","lastName":"Chen","id":"38238729700"},{"name":"Feng Xi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Nanjing University of Science & Technology, Nanjing, People's Republic of China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Xi","id":"37838270400"},{"name":"Zhong Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Nanjing University of Science & Technology, Nanjing, People's Republic of China"],"firstName":"Zhong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085419611"},{"name":"Bocheng Bao","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering Changzhou University, Changzhou, People's Republic of China"],"firstName":"Bocheng","lastName":"Bao","id":"37399379500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8058-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8057-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-3577"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1546-1874"}],"articleNumber":"7251866","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar","Bandwidth","Baseband","Demodulation","Dictionaries","Band-pass filters","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["baseband components","compressive inphase and quadrature components","compressive measurements","Landau-rate","compressive multiband signal","MQCS system","multiband quadrature compressive sampling system","multifunction radar","subLandau rate","multiband radar signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiband radar signal","compressive sampling","quadrature sampling","analog-to-information conversion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7251866","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251866","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7251315","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227493/7251315/07251866.pdf","startPage":"234","endPage":"238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quadrature compressive sampling of multiband radar signals at sub-Landau rate","abstract":"Sampling multiband radar signals is an essential issue of multiband/multifunction radar. This paper proposes a multiband quadrature compressive sampling (MQCS) system to perform the sampling at sub-Landau rate. The MQCS system randomly projects the multiband signal into a compressive multiband one by modulating each subband signal with a low-pass signal and then samples the compressive multiband signal at Landau-rate with output of compressive measurements. The compressive inphase and quadrature (I/Q) components of each subband are extracted from the compressive measurements respectively and are exploited to recover the baseband I/Q components. As effective bandwidth of the compressive multiband signal is much less than that of the received multiband one, the sampling rate is much less than Landau rate of the received signal. Simulation results validate that the proposed MQCS system can effectively acquire and reconstruct the baseband I/Q components of the multiband signals.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7251866/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 July 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7251866/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15452061","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Quadrature compressive sampling of multiband radar signals at sub-Landau rate","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quadrature compressive sampling of multiband radar signals at sub-Landau rate","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"We444P0323.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05788S","chronDate":"21-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227493","isNumber":"7251315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227493","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7251315","articleId":"7251866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7251867,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjie Ji","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Wenjie","lastName":"Ji","id":"37085618672"},{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38239017500"},{"name":"Xingru Peng","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Xingru","lastName":"Peng","id":"37085612146"},{"name":"Zhibin Liang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Zhibin","lastName":"Liang","id":"37085625392"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8058-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8057-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-3577"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1546-1874"}],"articleNumber":"7251867","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":184},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7251867","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Computational modeling","Clocks","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","decoding","forward error correction","next generation networks","parallel processing","pipeline processing","Reed-Solomon codes","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["next generation short-reach optical system","TSMC process","pipelining processing","folding processing","KES block","key equation solver block","CS-RiBM algorithm","compensated simplified reformulated inversionless Berlekamp-Massey algorithm","RS decoder","optical communication","16-channel two-parallel reed-solomon based forward error correction architecture","bit rate 156 Gbit/s","size 90 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reed-Solomon codes","optical communication systems","pipelined","folding"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251867","endPage":"243","startPage":"239","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227493/7251315/07251867.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7251315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"16-channel two-parallel reed-solomon based forward error correction architecture for optical communications","abstract":"This paper presents a high-efficiency two-parallel Reed-Solomon (RS) decoder based on the compensated simplified reformulated inversionless Berlekamp-Massey (CS-RiBM) algorithm.

The area of the proposed decoder is at least 35.6% fewer with the same technology, which meets the demands of next generation short-reach optical systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7251867/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7251867/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15452016","conferenceDate":"21-24 July 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"16-channel two-parallel reed-solomon based forward error correction architecture for optical communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"16-channel two-parallel reed-solomon based forward error correction architecture for optical communications","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"We451P0404.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068029S","chronDate":"21-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227493","isNumber":"7251315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227493","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7251315","articleId":"7251867","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7251868,"authors":[{"name":"Qichen Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Qichen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085409426"},{"name":"Yun Chen","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37539673600"},{"name":"Di Wu","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Di","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085426415"},{"name":"Xiaoyang Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyang","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37288001700"},{"name":"Yeong-luh Ueng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yeong-luh","lastName":"Ueng","id":"37393144500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8058-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8057-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-3577"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1546-1874"}],"articleNumber":"7251868","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":296},"abstract":"Stochastic computation is an excellent approach for low-density parity-check codes decoding. By adding edge memories at each edge in the Tanner graph, fully parallel hardware implementation can be designed with much lower wire complexity. This feature can alleviate the wire congestion in conventional Min-Sum decoders. However, edge memories occupy large physical area percentage of variable node and cause large dynamic power dissipation. In this paper, we propose an area-efficient counter based structure for variable nodes. In order to reduce the area of variable nodes, we eliminate the edge memories in all variable nodes and reuse the counter designed to function the hard-decision to trace the probability of the prior message. The value boundary of the counter is enlarged to record the probability more precisely, and the value of the counter is compared with a random number to determine the output of variable nodes. We also reuse parts of some sub-units in variable nodes to build others. As a result, for LDPC codes of 10GBASE-T (IEEE 802.3an-2006), the proposed structure of variable node can reduce 88.3% EM based variable node area.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International

(MIMO) uplink systems increases drastically. Being an indispensable part of linear detection, the matrix inversion suffers a lot from the huge matrix size of massive MIMO, and therefore becomes inefficient for realization. By achieving good tradeoff between complexity and performance, approximate matrix inversion via Neumann series now boosts one promising solution for linear detection of massive MIMO systems. In this paper, an efficient hardware architecture for approximate matrix inversion is proposed. This architecture is hardware efficient and suitable for various applications with different approximation precisions. FPGA implementation results of matrix inversion for 4 \u00d7 32 massive MIMO system have shown that the proposed architecture can achieve 56.7% higher frequency with only 58.9% hardware resources of its existing counterparts. Look-ahead transformations which can make the proposed architecture more suitable for high speed applications are also mentioned.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient matrix inversion architecture for linear detection in massive MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251869","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227493/7251315/07251869.pdf","startPage":"248","endPage":"252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7251315","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7251869","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7251869/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Efficient matrix inversion architecture for linear detection in massive MIMO systems","conferenceDate":"21-24 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7251869/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15438648","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient matrix inversion architecture for linear detection in massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"We453P0426.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070671S","chronDate":"21-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227493","isNumber":"7251315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227493","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7251315","articleId":"7251869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7251871,"authors":[{"name":"Xing Liu","affiliation":["Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xing","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085667773"},{"name":"Jin Sha","affiliation":["Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Sha","id":"37293859700"},{"name":"Chuan Zhang","affiliation":["Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Chuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085417787"},{"name":"Zhongfeng Wang","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation Irvine, California, USA"],"firstName":"Zhongfeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37279255300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8058-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8057-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-3577"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1546-1874"}],"articleNumber":"7251871","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":387},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Clocks","Computer architecture","Hardware","Schedules","Degradation","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stage-reduced SC decoding algorithm","polar code","stage-reduced low-latency successive cancellation decoder"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["polar codes","successive cancellation decoding","stage-reduced","decoder architecture"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7251871","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227493/7251315/07251871.pdf","startPage":"258","endPage":"262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251871","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7251315","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A stage-reduced low-latency successive cancellation decoder for polar codes","abstract":"Polar codes, which are the first capacity achieving codes, have recently become increasingly popular because of their low encoding and decoding complexity. However, the large code length required by practical applications leads to high decoding latency because the conventional successive cancellation (SC) decoder decodes bits serially. This brief first reviews the conventional SC decoder briefly. An improved SC decoder architecture is given, which reduces the decoding latency by 25% compared to the conventional one. Then a stage-reduced SC decoding algorithm and its low-latency architecture is presented. Compared with the conventional SC decoder, the proposed stage-reduced SC decoder achieves almost 50% latency reduction with no performance degradation and acceptable hardware overhead.

The nature of these impairments makes acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) harder to achieve, requiring the use of advanced and complex algorithms to offer satisfying performance. Adaptive filters in combination with nonlinear mapping schemes like Volterra and Hammerstein are widely used for this purpose. In this work, we address the AEC problem in the presence of severe nonlinear distortion. The proposed method based on metaheuristic optimization uses a genetic algorithm (GA) to estimate the nonlinear function parameters and the room impulse response. The method is compared to a reference technique that uses a sigmoid transform approach in conjunction with the recursive least square (RLS) algorithm. Simulation results show high robustness of the proposed approach to strong nonlinearities and saturation effects compared to the reference method.","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251879","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227493/7251315/07251879.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7251315","startPage":"297","endPage":"301","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust nonlinear acoustic echo cancellation using a metaheuristic optimization approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7251879","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust nonlinear acoustic echo cancellation using a metaheuristic optimization approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7251879/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 July 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15438756","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7251879/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust nonlinear acoustic echo cancellation using a metaheuristic optimization approach","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"Th113P0540.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056136S","chronDate":"21-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227493","isNumber":"7251315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227493","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7251315","articleId":"7251879","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7251884,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Eghbali","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Sweden, Goteborg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Eghbali","id":"37541154400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8058-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8057-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-3577"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1546-1874"}],"articleNumber":"7251884","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On sparse multimode zero forcing transceivers","abstract":"This paper introduces sparse multimode zero forcing transceivers in which a combination of \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-norm minimization and the Farrow structure allows efficient low-cost channel equalization.

First, by using the wavelet transform, the image is decomposed into low-frequency wavelet coefficients and high-frequency wavelet coefficients; Second, keep the low-frequency wavelet coefficients unchanged, use the measurement matrix to measure the high-frequency wavelet coefficients, and then combine with the unchanged low-frequency coefficients to reconstruct the image. Compared with the traditional compressive sensing algorithm, the improved compressive sensing algorithm can effectively improve the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of the reconstructed images. Moreover, in the improved compressive sensing algorithm, we use different matrices such as Gaussian random matrix, Bernoulli matrix, Toeplitz matrix, and Hadamard matrix to reconstruct the images. Comparisons show that the reconstructed images can achieve high PSNR when using Hadamard matrix.","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251892","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227493/7251315/07251892.pdf","startPage":"357","endPage":"360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7251315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image reconstruction based on the improved compressive sensing algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7251892","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7251892/","displayDocTitle":"Image reconstruction based on the improved compressive sensing algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15452013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7251892/","conferenceDate":"21-24 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image reconstruction based on the improved compressive sensing algorithm","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"Th142P0424.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051607S","chronDate":"21-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227493","isNumber":"7251315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227493","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7251315","articleId":"7251892","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7251897,"authors":[{"name":"Kuan-Chun Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kuan-Chun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37069473400"},{"name":"Shang-Ho Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shang-Ho","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37279553800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8058-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8057-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-3577"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1546-1874"}],"articleNumber":"7251897","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jitter","OFDM","Maximum likelihood estimation","Receivers","Radio frequency","Apertures","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["jitter","maximum likelihood estimation","radio receivers","signal sampling","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiband bandpass sampling systems","multiband bandpass sampling techniques","software define radio","SDR systems","maximum likelihood pilot-aided algorithm","decimate-and-average scheme","residual jitter effect"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7251897","abstract":"Multiband bandpass sampling techniques have been widely used in Soft Define Radio (SDR) systems.

At the first stage, a maximum likelihood pilot-aided algorithm is used to estimate and compensate the dominated jitter.

However, most current channel estimation methods for OFDM/OQAM require a considerable amount of pilots or preamble, which could damage such a bandwidth efficiency. In this paper, semiblind channel estimation for OFDM/OQAM systems is studied. The proposed method is based on exploiting the statistical properties of the signal and interference components in the received OQAM signal. Moreover, a scattered set of pilots of zero values is introduced to further improve channel estimation performance. Compared to a recently reported method, the proposed method shows advantages when the available received data for channel estimation is limited, making the proposed method more suitable when the channel coherence time is small. Simulation results verified the advantages of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251900","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227493/7251315/07251900.pdf","startPage":"393","endPage":"397","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7251315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semiblind channel estimation for OFDM/OQAM systems assisted by zero-valued pilots","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7251900","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7251900/","displayDocTitle":"Semiblind channel estimation for OFDM/OQAM systems assisted by zero-valued pilots","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15438750","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7251900/","conferenceDate":"21-24 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semiblind channel estimation for OFDM/OQAM systems assisted by zero-valued pilots","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"Th155P0537.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.1329S","chronDate":"21-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227493","isNumber":"7251315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227493","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7251315","articleId":"7251900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7251912,"authors":[{"name":"C.J.

A stochastic number is encoded by a unary bit stream where each bit is 0 or 1. The value of the number is represented by the percent of 1's in the number, and is interpreted as a probability. Each bit of the stochastic number can be modeled as a Bernoulli random variable, and each stochastic number can be represented by a binomial random variable. The variance of a stochastic number is given by p(1 - p)/N where N represents the number of bits in the sequence, and p represents the mean value of the number. For long word-lengths, a binomial random variable behaves as a Gaussian random variable. The mean and variance of a two-input stochastic logic gate are dependent on the bit-level correlation of the two inputs. This paper derives closed-form expressions for mean and variance of two-input stochastic logic gates with correlated inputs. An approach to synthesize correlated stochastic bit streams with specified correlation from uncorrelated bit streams is also presented. Using the proposed synthesis method, stochastic logic gates are simulated with correlated inputs. The simulated values of means and variances are shown to be the same as the theoretical values; thus, the closed-form expressions are validated.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227493/7251315/07251915.pdf","startPage":"463","endPage":"467","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251915","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251915","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7251315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of bit-level correlation in stochastic computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7251915/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Effect of bit-level correlation in stochastic computing","htmlLink":"/document/7251915/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15438630","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of bit-level correlation in stochastic computing","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"Th225P0630.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050099S","chronDate":"21-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227493","isNumber":"7251315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227493","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7251315","articleId":"7251915","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7251925,"authors":[{"name":"Bokamoso Basutli","affiliation":["Electrical and Systems Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK"],"firstName":"Bokamoso","lastName":"Basutli","id":"37085679953"},{"name":"Sangarapillai Lambotharan","affiliation":["Electrical and Systems Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK"],"firstName":"Sangarapillai","lastName":"Lambotharan","id":"37273617900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8058-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8057-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-3577"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1546-1874"}],"articleNumber":"7251925","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7251925","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Games","Signal to noise ratio","Array signal processing","Interference channels","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","game theory","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bargain region extension","mixed quality-of-service optimization","mixed QoS optimization","two-user game","Nash equilibrium point","NE-mixed QoS","maximum ratio transmission beamformers","MRT beamformers","cost function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Game theory","Nash equilibrium","bargaining","mixed QoS","bargain region","cooperative"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251925","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227493/7251315/07251925.pdf","startPage":"511","endPage":"515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7251315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extending the bargain region using beamforming design under mixed QoS constraints","abstract":"In this work, we demonstrate how the bargain region can be extended by using mixed quality-of-service (QoS) optimization in a two-user game.

This setup allows the implementation of a 3-user MIMO interference channel. We have implemented different IA decoding schemes that operate either before or after the Fast Fourier Transform block.

The design complexity of the IA testbed is significant since many simultaneous wireless links have to be established to observe the benefits of IA. Therefore, the already enormous efforts needed for the development of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) testbeds are folded multiple times in IA testbeds. In general, testbeds can be categorized into three groups depending on the hardware platform, generic, specific and the hybrid of two. Clearly, developing on generic, hybrid and application specific platforms in turn are the safe steps towards real life prototyping. There are many research groups that have been developing IA on generic platforms [1]-[17]. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one research group that has developed on a hybrid platform [18], and none on the application specific platform. In this paper, we review the experimental IA evaluations in the literature, include important aspects from well-known prototyping principles in the picture, and give comparative discussion with the state-of-art wireless communications testbeds.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7251940/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 July 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7251940/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15452025","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Implementation aspects for interference alignment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation aspects for interference alignment","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"Th323P0550.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090082S","chronDate":"21-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227493","isNumber":"7251315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227493","xplore-issue":"7251315","articleId":"7251940","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7251941,"authors":[{"name":"Nima N.

We consider a pilot-assisted interference alignment scheme in which part of radio resources are allocated to channel training and the remaining resources are used for data transmission. A more accurate channel estimation can be obtained by increasing pilot transmission power. Since each transmitter has limited energy budget, this implies that less power is available for data transmission. Clearly, there is a trade off between the allocated power for channel training and the one for data communication. In order to investigate this trade off, first we compute an achievable sum-rate, and next we find the optimum power allocation to pilot transmission and data transmission. Finally, we verify these theoretical results with experimental measurements on USRP-based test-bed.","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251941","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227493/7251315/07251941.pdf","startPage":"585","endPage":"589","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251941","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7251315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal power allocation for pilot-assisted interference alignment in MIMO interference networks: Test-bed results","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7251941","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7251941/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal power allocation for pilot-assisted interference alignment in MIMO interference networks: Test-bed results","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15452034","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7251941/","conferenceDate":"21-24 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal power allocation for pilot-assisted interference alignment in MIMO interference networks: Test-bed results","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"Th324P0586.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059911S","chronDate":"21-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227493","isNumber":"7251315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227493","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7251315","articleId":"7251941","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7251950,"authors":[{"name":"Guan Gui","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Systems Akita Prefectural University, Yurihonjo, Japan"],"firstName":"Guan","lastName":"Gui","id":"37590883700"},{"name":"Li Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Systems Akita Prefectural University, Yurihonjo, Japan"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Xu","id":"37279486600"},{"name":"Wentao Ma","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Wentao","lastName":"Ma","id":"37592837800"},{"name":"Badong Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Badong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37406619700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8058-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8057-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-3577"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1546-1874"}],"articleNumber":"7251950","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7251950","abstract":"Broadband wireless channels usually have the sparse nature. Based on the assumption of Gaussian noise model, adaptive filtering algorithms for reconstructing sparse channels were proposed to take advantage of channel sparsity. However, impulsive noises are often existed in many advanced broadband communications systems. These conventional algorithms are vulnerable to performance deteriorate by the impulsive noise. In this paper, sign least mean square algorithm (SLMS) based robust sparse adaptive filtering algorithms are proposed to estimate channels as well as to mitigate impulsive noise. By using different sparsity-inducing penalty functions, i.e., zero-attracting (ZA), reweighted ZA (RZA), reweighted L1-norm (RL1) and Lp-norm (LP), the proposed SLMS algorithms are termed as SLMS-ZA, SLMS-RZA, LSMS-RL1 and SLMS-LP.

A well known approach for separation of sources is the transformation to the time-frequency domain, where the task can be reduced to multiple instantaneous problems. While these may be easily solved using independent component analysis, this approach has the drawback of the inherent permutation and scaling ambiguities, which have to be corrected before the transformation to the time domain or otherwise the whole process will fail. Here, we extend an existing clustering approach to cope with the case where spatial aliasing occurs. This is achieved by exploiting the direction information of whole clusters instead of single bins. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on real-room recordings.","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251961","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227493/7251315/07251961.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7251315","startPage":"679","endPage":"683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A clustering approach for solving the spatial aliasing problem in convolutive blind source separation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7251961","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A clustering approach for solving the spatial aliasing problem in convolutive blind source separation","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7251961/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 July 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15438661","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7251961/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A clustering approach for solving the spatial aliasing problem in convolutive blind source separation","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"Th414P0255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071992S","chronDate":"21-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227493","isNumber":"7251315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227493","xplore-issue":"7251315","articleId":"7251961","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7251984,"authors":[{"name":"Dominik Rieth","affiliation":["Institute for Communication Technologies and Embedded Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Germany","Airbus Group Innovations, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Dominik","lastName":"Rieth","id":"37085386300"},{"name":"Christoph Heller","affiliation":["Airbus Group Innovations, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Heller","id":"37604283400"},{"name":"Gerd Ascheid","affiliation":["Institute for Communication Technologies and Embedded Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerd","lastName":"Ascheid","id":"37268217800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8058-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8057-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-3577"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1546-1874"}],"articleNumber":"7251984","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":380},"abstract":"This paper presents a novel architecture for the modulation scheme Shaped Offset QPSK (SOQPSK), which belongs to the class of Continuous Phase Modulations (CPMs).

More importantly, it provides a unifying framework for many KAF algorithms. However, suffering from huge computational load, especially when network size is large, it is not suitable for real-time applications. In order to extend its availability, we design a reconfigurable parallel FPGA accelerator for it. The generally used Gaussian kernel is chosen. Moreover, a novel quantization method is adopted to constrain the network size, so as to further reduce computational load and storage overhead. The proposed accelerator allows multiple input data to be processed simultaneously, accelerating the execution rate. Shift registers are used to record the results of different input data. The codebook and coefficients are updated for each input in sequential order along with the shifting of registers constantly. Finally, the FPGA accelerator with eight datapaths, which works at 100MHz, achieves an average speedup of 404.47 versus C code running on a 3GHz Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2320 CPU.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A reconfigurable parallel FPGA accelerator for the kernel affine projection algorithm","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7252008","startPage":"906","endPage":"910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7252008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7251315","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227493/7251315/07252008.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7252008","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7252008/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"A reconfigurable parallel FPGA accelerator for the kernel affine projection algorithm","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7252008/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15438690","conferenceDate":"21-24 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A reconfigurable parallel FPGA accelerator for the kernel affine projection algorithm","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"Fr151P0514.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073713S","chronDate":"21-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227493","isNumber":"7251315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227493","xplore-issue":"7251315","articleId":"7252008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7252010,"authors":[{"name":"Weihua Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Weihua","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085627602"},{"name":"Jihong Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jihong","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37405215200"},{"name":"Hua Qu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Qu","id":"37591430600"},{"name":"Badong Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Badong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37406619700"},{"name":"Jose C.

And we have taken advantage of graphics processing units (GPUs) in parallel to accelerate the complex calculation. We achieve RT-CT-RXD on the parallel structure and it can be easily further introduced into embedded systems.

Nevertheless, random sequences are usually used to construct sensing matrix, but it is difficult and expensive to be implemented in hardware, and may cause large Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) in OFDM system. Consequently, in this paper, the method that to obtain deterministic sensing matrix by deterministic sequence named as Golay Complementary Sequence is detailed investigated. Golay sequence has the properties as perfect periodic auto-correlations, simultaneously realizing timing acquisition and channel estimation. Also PAPR can be limited within 3dB in OFDM system by the method.

This paper proposes an effective deep learning framework by stacking multiple output features that learned through each stage of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Different from the traditional deep learning network, we use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to get the filter kernels of convolutional layer, which is name as Stacked PCA Network (SPCANet). Our SPCANet model follows the basic architecture of the CNN, which comprises three layers in each stage: convolutional filter layer, nonlinear processing layer and feature pooling layer. Firstly, in the convolutional filter layer of our model, PCA instead of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is employed to learn filter kernels, and the output of all cascaded convolutional filter layers is used as the input of nonlinear processing layer. Secondly, the following nonlinear processing layer is also simplified. We use hashing method for nonlinear processing. Thirdly, the block based histograms instead of max-pooling technique are employed in the feature pooling layer. In the last output layer, the output of each stage is stacked together as one final feature output of our model. Extensive experiments conducted on many different face recognition scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7252036/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 July 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7252036/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15438723","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Stacked PCA Network (SPCANet): An effective deep learning for face recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stacked PCA Network (SPCANet): An effective deep learning for face recognition","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"Fr243P0526.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097512S","chronDate":"21-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227493","isNumber":"7251315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227493","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7251315","articleId":"7252036","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7252037,"authors":[{"name":"Jiayuan Fan","affiliation":["Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jiayuan","lastName":"Fan","id":"37085385660"},{"name":"Tao Chen","affiliation":["Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085378481"},{"name":"Jiuwen Cao","affiliation":["Key Lab for IOT and Information Fusion Technology of Zhejiang, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Jiuwen","lastName":"Cao","id":"37085443368"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8058-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8057-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-3577"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1546-1874"}],"articleNumber":"7252037","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":319},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Histograms","Accuracy","Feature extraction","Digital images","Cameras","Noise reduction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image denoising","image enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image tampering detection","noise histogram features","digital image editing tools","intrinsic image regularities","noise difference","renormalized histogram","tampering operation order"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Forensics","Noise features","Histogram"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7252037","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7252037","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7252037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7251315","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227493/7251315/07252037.pdf","startPage":"1044","endPage":"1048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image tampering detection using noise histogram features","abstract":"With the rapid development of digital image editing tools, the authenticity of digital images becomes questionable in recent years. Image tampering detection is a technology that detects tampered images by using intrinsic image regularities. However, existing intrinsic image regularities are designed for one specific type of tampering operations. When multiple types of tampering operations are used to process a digital image, image tampering detection accuracy is seriously degraded. This paper exploits the re-normalized histogram of noise and noise difference as a new type of intrinsic image regularities, which is computed as the ratio of the histogram to the peak-value. When the image is operated by image tampering, the re-normalized histogram would increase as the peak value of this histogram would decrease. By applying the re-normalized histogram as features, the experimental results show that the proposed method has the ability to detect a wide range of tamper operations, including single type and multiple types of tampering operations without the prior knowledge of tampering operation order, type and parameter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7252037/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 July 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7252037/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15452102","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Image tampering detection using noise histogram features","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image tampering detection using noise histogram features","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"Fr244P0553.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111491S","chronDate":"21-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227493","isNumber":"7251315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227493","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7251315","articleId":"7252037","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7252041,"authors":[{"name":"Takahiro Inatsuki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan"],"firstName":"Takahiro","lastName":"Inatsuki","id":"37085735011"},{"name":"Masato Matsuura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan"],"firstName":"Masato","lastName":"Matsuura","id":"37078047600"},{"name":"Kosuke Morinaga","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan"],"firstName":"Kosuke","lastName":"Morinaga","id":"37078004900"},{"name":"Hiroshi Tsutsui","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Tsutsui","id":"37078116200"},{"name":"Yoshikazu Miyanaga","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshikazu","lastName":"Miyanaga","id":"37085562811"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8058-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8057-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-3577"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1546-1874"}],"articleNumber":"7252041","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":279},"abstract":"In this paper, we present an FPGA implementation of low-latency video transmission system.

Using HD resolution video simulations shows that the proposed schemes achieves slightly better PSNR performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7252043","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227493/7251315/07252043.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7252043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7251315","startPage":"1071","endPage":"1075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Framework of surveillance video analysis and transmission system using background modeling and MIMO-OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7252043","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Framework of surveillance video analysis and transmission system using background modeling and MIMO-OFDM","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7252043/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 July 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15438670","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7252043/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Framework of surveillance video analysis and transmission system using background modeling and MIMO-OFDM","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"Fr254P0572.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069067S","chronDate":"21-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227493","isNumber":"7251315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227493","xplore-issue":"7251315","articleId":"7252043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7252045,"authors":[{"name":"Naoto Sasaoka","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Tottori University, Tottori, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoto","lastName":"Sasaoka","id":"37266309400"},{"name":"Yusuke Adachi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Tottori University, Tottori, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Adachi","id":"37085721183"},{"name":"Yoshio Itoh","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Tottori University, Tottori, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshio","lastName":"Itoh","id":"37281486800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8058-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8057-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-3577"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1546-1874"}],"articleNumber":"7252045","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":276},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Estimation","Multipath channels","Accuracy","Channel estimation","OFDM","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","cognitive radio","MIMO communication","multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO multipath channels","channel capacity","Rician K factor estimation","cognitive radio","link adaptation","flat fading"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM","channel estimation","K factor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7252045","abstract":"The channel capacity of a MIMO system depends on a Rician K factor.

This paper presents a unified high throughput SVD/QRD precoder chip design for MIMO OFDM systems. A hardware-implementation-friendly Givens Rotation (GR) based SVD computing scheme is developed first. It starts with a bi-diagonalization phase followed by an iterative diagonalization phase consisting of successive nullification sweeps. A convergence detection mechanism is employed to terminate the computations if the required precision is achieved. The design successfully integrates the SVD module (for precoding) with the QR decomposition (QRD) module (for MIMO signal detection) under a unified hardware framework. The design features a two-level pipelined, fully parallel architecture and CORDIC processors are employed to implement the GR modules efficiently. Various design optimization techniques are applied to reduce the circuit complexity and the power consumption. The implementation using TSMC 90nm process technology indicates a 35.75M SVDs per second throughput rate when operating at 143MHz. Both the throughput rate and the gate count efficiency of the proposed one outperform previous designs significantly.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high throughput unified SVD/QRD precoder design for MIMO OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7252059","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227493/7251315/07252059.pdf","startPage":"1148","endPage":"1151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7252059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7251315","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7252059","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7252059/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"A high throughput unified SVD/QRD precoder design for MIMO OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"21-24 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7252059/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15452037","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high throughput unified SVD/QRD precoder design for MIMO OFDM systems","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"Fr353P0479.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055627S","chronDate":"21-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227493","isNumber":"7251315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227493","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7251315","articleId":"7252059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7252063,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Wu","affiliation":["Loughborough University, Leicestershire, UK"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085407375"},{"name":"Sangarapillai Lambotharan","affiliation":["Loughborough University, Leicestershire, UK"],"firstName":"Sangarapillai","lastName":"Lambotharan","id":"37273617900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8058-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8057-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-3577"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1546-1874"}],"articleNumber":"7252063","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7252063","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Optimization","Resource management","Array signal processing","Downlink","Uplink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cellular radio","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference constraint","SINR balancing","coordinated multicell beamforming","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","base station transmission power","uplink-downlink duality","downlink problem","uplink beamformer design problem"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7252063","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227493/7251315/07252063.pdf","startPage":"1166","endPage":"1170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7252063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7251315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An interference constraint and SINR balancing based coordinated multicell beamforming","abstract":"We propose a coordinated multicell beamformer design based on balancing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) to multiple levels.

To ensure robust performance, only the interference-plus-noise components are used in the computation of covariance matrix. Any leakage of the desired signal will introduce distortion at the beamformer output and under-estimation of the interference and/or noise will lead to a reduction in interference and noise suppression. To identify interference-plus-noise components from the received microphone signals, we analyze the microphone outputs in the short-time Fourier transform domain where we exploit property of the Hermitian angle in complex vector space. This information is then used to determine the interference-plus-noise presence probability which is then incorporated to the updating process of covariance matrix estimation. We show that the proposed algorithm outperforms a recently proposed algorithm for both simulated and recorded data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7252069/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15438681","publicationDate":"July 2015","conferenceDate":"21-24 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7252069/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Speech enhancement via covariance estimation using Hermitian angle in adaptive beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech enhancement via covariance estimation using Hermitian angle in adaptive beamforming","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"Fr422P0412.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072607S","chronDate":"21-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227493","isNumber":"7251315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227493","xplore-issue":"7251315","articleId":"7252069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7252072,"authors":[{"name":"Alastair H.

Spatial filtering can reduce interference from noise and reverberation but in even moderately reverberant environments the beam pattern fails to suppress reverberation to a level adequate for typical applications. In this paper we investigate the feasibility of applying dereverberation by considering multiple beamformer outputs as channels to be dereverberated. In one realisation we process directly in the spherical harmonic domain where the beampatterns are mutually orthogonal. In a second realisation, which is not limited to spherical microphone arrays, beams are pointed in the direction of dominant reflections. Simulations demonstrate that in both cases reverberation is significantly reduced and, in the best case, clarity index is improved by 15 dB.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7252072/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15438754","publicationDate":"July 2015","conferenceDate":"21-24 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7252072/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multichannel equalisation for high-order spherical microphone arrays using beamformed channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multichannel equalisation for high-order spherical microphone arrays using beamformed channels","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"Fr425P0575.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063008S","chronDate":"21-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227493","isNumber":"7251315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227493","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7251315","articleId":"7252072","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7252076,"authors":[{"name":"Pengming Feng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Pengming","lastName":"Feng","id":"37085341861"},{"name":"Wenwu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Wenwu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280468500"},{"name":"Syed Mohsen Naqvi","affiliation":["Loughborough University, Loughborough, Leicestershire, GB"],"firstName":"Syed Mohsen","lastName":"Naqvi","id":"37629484600"},{"name":"Jonathon A.

In this paper, we propose a feature representation method which succinctly captures these three low-level components at multiple scales. Riesz wavelet transform is employed to obtain multi-scale monogenic wavelets, which are formulated by quaternion representation. Instead of summing up the multi-scale monogenic representations, we consider all monogenic representations across multiple scales as individual features. For classification, two schemes were applied to integrate these multiple feature representations: a fusion-based method which combines the features efficiently and discriminately using the ultra-fast, optimized Multiple Kernel Learning (UFO-MKL) algorithm; and concatenation-based method where the features are combined into a single feature vector and classified by a linear SVM. Experiments carried out on a recent spontaneous micro-expression database demonstrated the capability of the proposed method in outperforming the state-of-the-art monogenic signal approach to solving the micro-expression recognition problem.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monogenic Riesz wavelet representation for micro-expression recognition","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7252078","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227493/7251315/07252078.pdf","startPage":"1237","endPage":"1241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7252078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7251315","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7252078","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7252078/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Monogenic Riesz wavelet representation for micro-expression recognition","conferenceDate":"21-24 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7252078/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15452101","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monogenic Riesz wavelet representation for micro-expression recognition","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"Fr443P0335.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075457S","chronDate":"21-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227493","isNumber":"7251315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227493","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7251315","articleId":"7252078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7252081,"authors":[{"name":"Carlo Safarian","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Santa Clara University, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Carlo","lastName":"Safarian","id":"37085703106"},{"name":"Tokunbo Ogunfunmi","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Santa Clara University, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Tokunbo","lastName":"Ogunfunmi","id":"37085450640"},{"name":"Walter J.

Classifying digestive organs in WCE images intuitively means to recognize higher semantic image features. To achieve this, an effective deep CNN-based WCE classification system has been constructed (DCNN-WCE-CS). With about 1 million real WCE images, intensive experiments are conducted to evaluate its performance by setting different network parameters. Results illustrate its superior performance compared to traditional classification methods, where about 95% classification accuracy can be achieved in average.

Synchronizing standards which permit both flexible and automatic operations are discussed. Transmitter synchronizing apparatus for flexible synchronizing standards, receiver circuits for both non-automatic and automatic synchronizing operation are also discussed, and a \u201ctransition\u201d type receiver for operation on both old and new types of synchronizing signals is briefly described.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers","pdfPath":"/iel7/7226733/7252751/07252756.pdf","startPage":"254","endPage":"267","publicationTitle":"Journal of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers","doi":"10.5594/J10048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.5594/J10048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7252751","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7252756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Method of Synchronization for Television Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"SMPTE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7252756/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1940","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1940","displayDocTitle":"A New Method of Synchronization for Television Systems","volume":"35","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1940","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Method of Synchronization for Television Systems","sourcePdf":"10-5594_J10048.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038021S","chronDate":"Sept.  1940","isNumber":"7252751","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7226733","citationCount":"2","articleId":"7252756","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1940","subType":"SMPTE Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7253640,"authors":[{"name":"Subhra Chakraborty","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra Ranchi, Jharkhand, India"],"firstName":"Subhra","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"37085611004"},{"name":"Abhishek Pandey","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra Ranchi, Jharkhand, India"],"firstName":"Abhishek","lastName":"Pandey","id":"37085608913"},{"name":"Vijay Nath","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra Ranchi, Jharkhand, India"],"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Nath","id":"37398659900"}],"articleNumber":"7253640","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"abstract":"Removed.","doi":"10.1109/EESCO.2015.7253640","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, Signals, Communication and Optimization (EESCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, Signals, Communication and Optimization (EESCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227935/7253613/07253640.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7253613","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EESCO.2015.7253640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Notice of Removal: A novel 116 dB operational amplifier design using positive feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7253640","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Notice of Removal: A novel 116 dB operational amplifier design using positive feedback","xploreNote":"Document Removed From IEEE Xplore: This document has been removed from IEEE Xplore as this conference has chosen to implement IEEE's policy on non-presented papers as per section 8.2.1.B.13 of IEEE's \"Publication Services and Products Board Operations Manual\".

Flexibility in EONs is also guaranteed by emerging sliceable bandwidth variable transponders (SBVTs) that support the simultaneous generation of multiple optical carriers. Such carriers can be used to serve different lightpaths (i.e., slice-ability), or can be merged into a single high-rate superchannel. SBVTs typically use a dedicated laser to generate each carrier, i.e., multilasers SBVT (ML-SBVT). Alternatively, a multiwavelength source can be used to generate multiple carriers using a single laser, i.e., multiwavelength SBVT (MW-SBVT). MW-SBVT improves the super-channel spectrum efficiency. Indeed, MW-SBVT reduces the intercarrier interference among the subcarriers composing the super-channel; thus, it is possible to reduce the guard bands among subcarriers. With ML-SBVT, each subcarrier suffers from unstableness of the related laser and intercarrier interference may have a huge impact, thus, higher guard bands are needed. On the other hand, the use of a MW-SBVT introduces specific constraints to the routing and spectrum assignment (RSA), because the spacing among the subcarriers is limited to a range of specific values. To take into account the constraints introduced by transponders, this paper integrates the selection of the transponder into RSA; thus, proposing a dynamic routing, spectrum, and transponder assignment (RSTA) scheme supporting both ML-SBVT and MW-SBVT technologies, and aiming to combine the benefits of the two technologies. Simulation results show that the proposed RSTA scheme provides benefits in terms of achieved blocking probability compared to the traditional RSA schemes. Moreover, the achieved results demonstrate that jointly using both SBVT technologies provides significant benefits with respect to the utilization of any single SBVT technology.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2477898","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7286894/07254110.pdf","startPage":"4648","endPage":"4658","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2477898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7286894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Routing, Spectrum, and Transponder Assignment in Elastic Optical Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7254110/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.15, 15 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Routing, Spectrum, and Transponder Assignment in Elastic Optical Networks","volume":"33","issue":"22","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15500102","publicationDate":"15 Nov.15, 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7254110/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EU-FP7 IDEALIST"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Routing, Spectrum, and Transponder Assignment in Elastic Optical Networks","sourcePdf":"jlt-dallaglio-2477898-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109902S","chronDate":"Nov.15, 15 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7286894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7286894","articleId":"7254110","onlineDate":"10 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-25"},{"_id":7254112,"authors":[{"name":"Vittorio Curri","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Telecomunicazioni, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Vittorio Curri (M\u201999) was born in Ivrea, Italy, in 1970.

It is based on the well accepted thesis that in the considered system scenario propagation effects can be approximately and conservatively modeled as an additive Gaussian disturbance called nonlinear interference (NLI), and it exploits the GN-model for analytical calculations. As an example, we apply the developed method to three typical fiber types with fiber-span loss A\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">f</sub>\n from 20 to 30 dB, and show that the pure counter-propagating pumping scheme is always close to be optimal. Using this pumping scheme, the merit of Raman pumping is very similar for all the considered fibers and its maximum is enabled by full-Raman amplification with an OSNR improvement that increases with A\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">f</sub>\n, and goes from 4 to 5 dB in the explored range. We show that adding some copropagating pump, we obtain a further OSNR improvement of only up to 0.9 dB, so, for the considered scenarios, it does not emerge any indications for the use of some copropagating pump in HFA. Moreover, for counter-propagating pumping schemes, we can obtain about 80% of the maximum Raman merit setting the Raman gain in the HFA only to 60% of the overall gain. We define as moderate pumping regime this HFA operating-mode, that, besides being convenient from an energy-efficiency point of view, it is also irrelevantly affected by pump depletion and so it is very stable in case some input channels are added/dropped, as required by reconfigurable optical networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7254112/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15, 15 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"34","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"15 Jan.15, 2016","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7254112/","accessionNumber":"15786105","displayDocTitle":"Merit of Raman Pumping in Uniform and Uncompensated Links Supporting NyWDM Transmission","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004351","fundingName":"CISCO Systems"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004731","fundingName":"SRA contract"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Merit of Raman Pumping in Uniform and Uncompensated Links Supporting NyWDM Transmission","sourcePdf":"jlt-curri-2477599-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107937S","chronDate":"Jan.15, 15 2016","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7405362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7405362","articleId":"7254112","onlineDate":"10 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7254115,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Lissandron","affiliation":["Information Engineering Department, University of Padua, Padua, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245517/7394954/7254115/lissa-2477902-small.gif","p":["Stefano Lissandron (S\u201913) received the M.S.

System stability can be addressed by analyzing the source and load impedances at the interaction section, and well-established approaches exist for dc and three-phase ac networks. Some papers also focused on single-phase ac systems, whose study is generally more difficult due to their time-varying characteristics. Similar to the approaches based on dq rotating frame impedances, this paper focuses on single-phase systems using the dynamic phasor approach to determine the 2-D source and load impedances. The system stability is then evaluated using the generalized Nyquist stability criterion. As an example of application, a single-phase ac system that includes a current-controlled inverter synchronized to the grid through a phase-locked loop is proposed.

This paper proposes a new solution to address this problem. Full-bridge submodules (SMs) are used in the place of half-bridge SMs in the MMC to significantly reduce the low-frequency pulsating power in the SM capacitors in startup or low-speed motor drives. Furthermore, quasi-resonant controllers are adopted to acquire improved tracking performance for injected circulating current. Simulation and experimental results are presented and have proved the validity of the proposed method. Comparisons of efficiency and cost between the conventional and the proposed solutions further demonstrate the potential of proposed method for MV drive applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7254116/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2015","volume":"4","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"15956371","publicationDate":"June 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7254116/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Low-Frequency Ripple Suppression for Medium-Voltage Drives Using Modular Multilevel Converter With Full-Bridge Submodules","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Power Electronics Science and Education Development Program through the Delta Environmental and Educational Foundation","grantNumber":"DREG2014013"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51477063"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Frequency Ripple Suppression for Medium-Voltage Drives Using Modular Multilevel Converter With Full-Bridge Submodules","sourcePdf":"jestpe-zhang-2477433-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093661S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6245517","isNumber":"7463098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245517","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"7463098","articleId":"7254116","onlineDate":"10 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7254117,"authors":[{"name":"Toshiaki Koike-Akino","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Toshiaki Koike-Akino (M\u201905\u2013SM\u201911) received the B.S.\n degree in electrical and electronics engineering, M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in communications and computer engineering\n from Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, in 2002, 2003, and 2005, respectively.

However, their promising performance cannot always be obtained due to practical constraints, such as finite codeword length, finite iteration, finite memory, and finite precision. In this paper, we focus on a practical design method of high-performance LDPC codes under a constraint of finite-iteration decoding for low-power optical communications. We introduce an iteration-aware LDPC code design approach, which is based on decoding trajectory in extrinsic information transfer chart analysis. It is demonstrated that an LDPC code designed by the conventional curve-fitting method exhibits nearly 2 dB of penalty, when the maximum number of iterations is limited. The results suggest that the LDPC code should be adaptively changed, e.g., when the number of decoding iterations is decreased to save power consumption. We also extend our design method to a multi-objective optimization concept by taking average degrees into account, so that the threshold and the computational complexity are minimized at the same time. The proposed Pareto-optimal codes can achieve additional 2-dB gain or 50% complexity reduction at maximum, in low-power decoding scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2477881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7405362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2477881","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7405362/07254117.pdf","startPage":"573","endPage":"581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iteration-Aware LDPC Code Design for Low-Power Optical Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Iteration-Aware LDPC Code Design for Low-Power Optical Communications","volume":"34","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15, 15 2016","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7254117/","publicationDate":"15 Jan.15, 2016","accessionNumber":"15786083","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7254117/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iteration-Aware LDPC Code Design for Low-Power Optical Communications","sourcePdf":"jlt-koikeakino-2477881-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155684S","chronDate":"Jan.15, 15 2016","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7405362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7405362","articleId":"7254117","onlineDate":"10 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7254127,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Shi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Victoria University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Shi","id":"37287152000"},{"name":"Xiaojie Su","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Dependable Service Computing in Cyber Physical Society, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaojie","lastName":"Su","id":"37530892100"},{"name":"Fanbiao Li","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Fanbiao","lastName":"Li","id":"37958341600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"7254127","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":195,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1525},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7254127","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switched systems","Switches","Stochastic processes","Stochastic systems","Symmetric matrices","Automation","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","Brownian motion","filtering theory","filters","fuzzy systems","linearisation techniques","Lyapunov methods","stochastic systems","switching systems (control)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic perturbation","T-S fuzzy switched systems","dissipativity performance","mean-square exponential stability","Brownian motion","piecewise Lyapunov function technique","fuzzy filters","filter error dynamic system","dissipative performance","solvability condition","linearization procedure","dissipativity-based filtering","average dwell time technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Switched systems","filter design","dissipativity analysis","stochastic systems","Fuzzy systems"]},{"kwd":["Dissipativity analysis","filter design","fuzzy systems","stochastic systems","switched systems"]}],"abstract":"In this technical note, the problem of the dissipativity-based filtering problem is considered for a class of T-S fuzzy switched systems with stochastic perturbation.

However, OFDM-based VLC systems suffer from a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), along with the nonlinear transfer characteristics of light-emitting diodes (LEDs). In this paper, a subcarrier grouping scheme for an OFDM-based VLC system is proposed. This scheme exploits the property that one LED lamp usually contains multiple independent LED chips. In the proposed scheme, all OFDM signal subcarriers are divided into groups, and each group is transmitted by an individual LED chip while the same receiver structure is maintained. The PAPR is reduced significantly because only some of the subcarriers are located on each LED chip. Hence, the achievable input power can be increased, leading to a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and a lower bit error rate (BER). Simulated and experimental results demonstrate that the BER performance can be improved by over two orders of magnitude. Moreover, an adaptive switching mechanism is also proposed in this paper, in which a subcarrier grouping scheme is employed adaptively when the required input power is high. Simulation results validate that the proposed mechanism can enhance system robustness significantly.","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2477900","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/7222813/07254143.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2477900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7222813","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subcarrier Grouping OFDM for Visible-Light Communication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7254143","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Subcarrier Grouping OFDM for Visible-Light Communication Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7254143/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"externalId":"7903812","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15451663","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7254143/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329203"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2013AA013601"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Program of State Grid Corporation of China","grantNumber":"SGHAZZ00FCJS1500238"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Subcarrier Grouping OFDM for Visible-Light Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"jphot-yu-2477900-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091695S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"7222813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7222813","articleId":"7254143","onlineDate":"10 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7254155,"authors":[{"name":"Thiow Keng Tan","affiliation":["NTT DOCOMO, Inc., Tokyo, Japan","M-Sphere Consulting Pte.

In order to evaluate this goal, verification tests were conducted by the Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding of ITU-T SG 16 WP 3 and ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29. This paper presents the subjective and objective results of a verification test in which the performance of the new standard is compared with its highly successful predecessor, the Advanced Video Coding (AVC) video compression standard (ITU-T H.264 and ISO/IEC 14496-10). The test used video sequences with resolutions ranging from 480p up to ultra-high definition, encoded at various quality levels using the HEVC Main profile and the AVC High profile. In order to provide a clear evaluation, this paper also discusses various aspects for the analysis of the test results. The tests showed that bit rate savings of 59% on average can be achieved by HEVC for the same perceived video quality, which is higher than a bit rate saving of 44% demonstrated with the PSNR objective quality metric. However, it has been shown that the bit rates required to achieve good quality of compressed content, as well as the bit rate savings relative to AVC, are highly dependent on the characteristics of the tested content.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2477916","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2477916","startPage":"76","endPage":"90","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/7372356/07254155.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7372356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video Quality Evaluation Methodology and Verification Testing of HEVC Compression Performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7254155/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Video Quality Evaluation Methodology and Verification Testing of HEVC Compression Performance","volume":"26","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2016","accessionNumber":"15689042","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7254155/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Video Quality Evaluation Methodology and Verification Testing of HEVC Compression Performance","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-tan-2477916-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150577S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7372356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"7372356","articleId":"7254155","onlineDate":"10 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7254160,"authors":[{"name":"Jung Min Pak","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jung Min","lastName":"Pak","id":"37665453800"},{"name":"Choon Ki Ahn","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Choon Ki","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37061578700"},{"name":"Yuriy S.

The horizon sizes and the number of FIR filters in the SEFFB are adapted to changes in system characteristics using maximum likelihood. The SEFFB is applied to target tracking using a ground moving target indicator.

With this method, the problem of over-fitting can be effectively suppressed, so that deep CNNs can be trained from scratch with a small number of training data, i.e., 420 labeled albums with about 30 000 photos. This method can effectively deal with sets of images, no matter if the sets bear temporal structures. A typical approach to sequential image analysis usually leverages motions between adjacent frames, while the proposed method focuses on capturing the co-occurrences and frequencies of features. Nevertheless, our method outperforms previous best performers in terms of album classification, and achieves comparable or even better performances in terms of gait based human identification. These results demonstrate its effectiveness and good adaptivity to different kinds of set data.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Representative Deep Features for Image Set Analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2015.2477681","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/7302100/07254176.pdf","startPage":"1960","endPage":"1968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2015.2477681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7302100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7254176","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7254176/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Learning Representative Deep Features for Image Set Analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7254176/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15553469","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Representative Deep Features for Image Set Analysis","sourcePdf":"tmm-wu-2477681-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102498S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"7302100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"7302100","articleId":"7254176","onlineDate":"10 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7254179,"authors":[{"name":"Corey Kereliuk","affiliation":["DTU Compute, The Technical University of Denmark, Frederiksberg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/7302100/7254179/7254179-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Corey Kereliuk received the Ph.D. degree in music from McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, in 2013.","His research interests include signal processing and machine learning as they apply to the analysis, modification, and synthesis of music recordings."]},"firstName":"Corey","lastName":"Kereliuk","id":"37085619565"},{"name":"Bob L.

Recent work builds adversaries for deep learning systems applied to image object recognition, exploiting the parameters of the system to find the minimal perturbation of the input image such that the system misclassifies it with high confidence. We adapt this approach to construct and deploy an adversary of deep learning systems applied to music content analysis. In our case, however, the system inputs are magnitude spectral frames, which require special care in order to produce valid input audio signals from network- derived perturbations . For two different train-test partitionings of two benchmark datasets, and two different architectures , we find that this adversary is very effective. We find that convolutional architectures are more robust compared to systems based on a majority vote over individually classified audio frames. Furthermore , we experiment with a new system that integrates an adversary into the training loop, but do not find that this improves the resilience of the system to new adversaries.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2015.2478068","startPage":"2059","endPage":"2071","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2015.2478068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7302100","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/7302100/07254179.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning and Music Adversaries","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7254179/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning and Music Adversaries","volume":"17","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7254179/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15553467","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning and Music Adversaries","sourcePdf":"tmm-kereliuk-2478068-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128312S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"7302100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"7302100","articleId":"7254179","onlineDate":"10 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7254184,"authors":[{"name":"Abrar H.

Each CNN will generate attribute-specific feature representations, and then we apply multi-task learning on the features to predict their attributes. In our multi-task framework, we propose a method to decompose the overall model's parameters into a latent task matrix and combination matrix. Furthermore, under-sampled classifiers can leverage shared statistics from other classifiers to improve their performance. Natural grouping of attributes is applied such that attributes in the same group are encouraged to share more knowledge. Meanwhile, attributes in different groups will generally compete with each other, and consequently share less knowledge.

Without adding any additional components to the system, the leakage current caused by the PV-to-ground parasitic capacitance can be bypassed by introducing a common-mode (CM) conducting path to the inverter. The resulting ground leakage current is therefore well controlled to be below the regulation limit. Furthermore, the proposed inverter can also eliminate the well-known double-line-frequency pulsating power that is inherent in single-phase PV systems. By properly injecting CM voltages to the output filter capacitors, the pulsating power can be decoupled from the dc-link. Therefore, it is possible to use long-lifetime film capacitors instead of electrolytic capacitors to improve the reliability of the PV system. The mechanism of leakage current suppression and the closed-loop control of pulsating power decoupling are discussed in this paper in detail. A 500-W prototype was also built and tested in the laboratory, and both simulation and experimental results are finally presented to show the excellent performance of the proposed PV inverter.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Leakage currents","Capacitors","Impedance","Inductors","Voltage control","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","invertors","leakage currents","photovoltaic power systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["highly reliable transformerless photovoltaic inverters","leakage current","grid-connected photovoltaic systems","common-mode conducting path","closed-loop control","pulsating power decoupling","power 500 W"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Leakage current","power decoupling","single-phase system","transformerless photovoltaic inverter"]},{"kwd":["Leakage current","power decoupling","single-phase system","transformerless photovoltaic (PV) inverter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2477802","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7377137/07254185.pdf","startPage":"1016","endPage":"1026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7377137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2477802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Highly Reliable Transformerless Photovoltaic Inverters With Leakage Current and Pulsating Power Elimination","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7254185","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Highly Reliable Transformerless Photovoltaic Inverters With Leakage Current and Pulsating Power Elimination","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7254185/","volume":"63","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7254185/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15697126","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly Reliable Transformerless Photovoltaic Inverters With Leakage Current and Pulsating Power Elimination","sourcePdf":"tie-tang-2477802-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094954S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7377137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"7377137","articleId":"7254185","onlineDate":"10 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7254187,"authors":[{"name":"Udaya Bhaskar Rongala","affiliation":["Scuola Superiore Sant\u2019Anna, The BioRobotics Institute, Pontedera, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7879455/7254187/ronga-2472477-small.gif","p":["Udaya Bhaskar Rongala was born in India in 1988.

Naturalistic textures were evaluated with a passive touch protocol. The resulting neuromorphic spike trains were able to classify ten naturalistic textures ranging from textiles to glass to BioSkin, with accuracy as high as 97%. Remarkably, rather than on firing rate features calculated over the stimulation window, the highest achieved decoding performance was based on the precise spike timing of the neuromorphic output as captured by Victor Purpura distance. We also systematically varied the sliding velocity and the contact force to investigate the role of sensing conditions in categorizing the stimuli via the artificial sensory system. We found that the decoding performance based on the timing of neuromorphic spike events was robust for a broad range of sensing conditions. Being able to categorize naturalistic textures in different sensing conditions, these neurorobotic results pave the way to the use of neuromorphic tactile sensors in future real-life neuroprosthetic applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7879455/07254187.pdf","startPage":"819","endPage":"829","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2472477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2472477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7879455","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7254187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neuromorphic Artificial Touch for Categorization of Naturalistic Textures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neuromorphics","Force","Robot sensing systems","Neurons","Decoding","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomimetics","mechanoception","neurocontrollers","robots","tactile sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neuromorphic artificial touch","naturalistic texture categorization","mechanoreceptor firing behavior","biomimetic tactile sensor","Izhikevich neuronal model","passive touch protocol","neuromorphic spike trains","BioSkin","firing rate features","stimulation window","neuromorphic output spike timing","Victor Purpura distance","artificial sensory system","neurorobotics","neuromorphic tactile sensors","neuroprosthetic applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neuromorphic artificial touch","neuroprosthetics","neurorobotics","spike-based decoding","tactile sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7254187/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Neuromorphic Artificial Touch for Categorization of Naturalistic Textures","volume":"28","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7254187/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16759890","pubMedId":"26372658","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"DG Connect through the NEBIAS European Project entitled NEurocontrolled BIdirectional Artificial Upper Limb and Hand Prosthesis","grantNumber":"EU-FP7-ICT-611687"},{"fundingName":"Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation through the Directorate General for Country Promotion (Economy, Culture and Science)\u2013Unit for Scientific and Technological Cooperation via the SensBrain Italy\u2013Sweden Bilateral Research Project entitled Brain Network Mechanisms for Integration of Natural Tactile Input Patterns"},{"fundingName":"Ministero dell\u2019Istruzione, dell\u2019Universit\u00e0 e della Ricerca (MIUR) through the Italian Progetti di Rilevante Interesse Nazionale (PRIN) programme with the HandBot Project entitled Biomechatronic Hand Prostheses Endowed with Bio-Inspired Tactile Perception, Bi-Directional Neural Interfaces and Distributed Sensori-Motor Control","grantNumber":"CUP: B81J12002680008 prot.: 20102YF2RY"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission through the NanoBioTouch European Project entitled Nanoresolved Multiscale Investigations of Human Tactile Sensations and Tissue Engineered Nanobiosensors","grantNumber":"EU-FP7-NMP-228844"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neuromorphic Artificial Touch for Categorization of Naturalistic Textures","sourcePdf":"tnnls-oddo-2472477-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089992S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7879455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"7879455","articleId":"7254187","onlineDate":"10 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7254197,"authors":[{"name":"Daniele Perrone","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, University of Bern, Nebr\u00fcckstrasse 10, Bern, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/7464929/7254197/perro-2477819-small.gif","p":["Daniele Perrone received the BEng degree from the Universit\u00e0\n della Calabria in 2007 and the MEng degree in artificial intelligence from \u201cSapienza\u201d Universit\u00e0 di\n Roma in 2009.

Recently, there has been a significant effort on understanding the basic mechanisms to solve blind deconvolution. While this effort resulted in the deployment of effective algorithms, the theoretical findings generated contrasting views on why these approaches worked. On the one hand, one could observe experimentally that alternating energy minimization algorithms converge to the desired solution. On the other hand, it has been shown that such alternating minimization algorithms should fail to converge and one should instead use a so-called Variational Bayes approach. To clarify this conundrum, recent work showed that a good image and blur prior is instead what makes a blind deconvolution algorithm work. Unfortunately, this analysis did not apply to algorithms based on total variation regularization. In this manuscript, we provide both analysis and experiments to get a clearer picture of blind deconvolution. Our analysis reveals the very reason why an algorithm based on total variation works. We also introduce an implementation of this algorithm and show that, in spite of its extreme simplicity, it is very robust and achieves a performance comparable to the top performing algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/7464929/07254197.pdf","startPage":"1041","endPage":"1055","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2477819","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2477819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7464929","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7254197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Clearer Picture of Total Variation Blind Deconvolution","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deconvolution","Kernel","Minimization","Algorithm design and analysis","TV","Convolution","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deconvolution","image denoising","image restoration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["total variation blind deconvolution","sharp image recovery","blur kernel recovery","noisy blurry image","alternating energy minimization algorithms","variational Bayes approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deblurring","blind deconvolution","total variation"]},{"kwd":["Deblurring","blind deconvolution","total variation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7254197/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Clearer Picture of Total Variation Blind Deconvolution","volume":"38","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7254197/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 June 2016","accessionNumber":"16023295","pubMedId":"26372205","dateOfInsertion":"04 May 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006785","fundingName":"Google","grantNumber":"113095"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Clearer Picture of Total Variation Blind Deconvolution","sourcePdf":"tpami-perrone-2477819-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155192S","chronDate":"June 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"7464929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"7464929","articleId":"7254197","onlineDate":"10 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":7254203,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Morstyn","affiliation":["Australian Energy Research Institute, University of New South Wales (UNSW Australia), Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/7463573/7254203/7254203-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Thomas Morstyn (S'13) received the B.E.

The multi-timescale nature of cascading outages makes conventional quasi-static simulation methods inaccurate in characterizing actual evolution of outages. This paper proposes a multi-timescale cascading outage model using a quasi-dynamic simulation method. The model establishes a framework for simulating interactions among dynamics in quite different timescales. It realizes simulation of cascading outages with representation of time evolution, so it overcomes ambiguity of time in conventional cascading outage models and hence has better practicality. Moreover, the model considers dynamics, e.g., load variation and generator excitation protection which affect voltage and reactive power profiles. Also, an improved re-dispatch model based on sensitivity is proposed. These improvements facilitate better simulation for a realistic power system. Also, dynamic simulation can be flexibly incorporated into the simulation of short-term processes in this model as needed. Case studies with the proposed multi-timescale model on the IEEE 30-bus system discuss the role of generator protection in cascading outage evolution, and analyze stage characteristics in outages. The multi-timescale model is also demonstrated on a reduced 410-bus US-Canada northeast power grid.

Furthermore, a nonuniform rate of operational degradation induces electrothermal variations thereby accelerating the development of failure. This paper uses simulations and experiments to quantitatively and qualitatively investigate the impact of electrothermal variations on the reliability of parallel connected power devices under unclamped inductive switching (UIS) conditions. This is especially pertinent to SiC where small die areas mean devices are often connected in parallel for higher current capability. Measurements and simulations show that increasing the variation in the initial junction temperatures and switching rates between parallel connected devices under UIS reduces the total sustainable avalanche current by 10%. It is seen that the device with the lower junction temperature and lower switching rate fails. The measurements also show that the maximum sustainable avalanche energy for a given variation in junction temperature and switching rate increases with the avalanche duration, meaning that the effect of electrothermal variation is more critical with high power (high current and low inductor) UIS pulses compared with high energy (low current and high inductance) pulses. These results are important for condition monitoring and reliability analysis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Effect of Electrothermal Nonuniformities on Parallel Connected SiC Power Devices Under Unclamped and Clamped Inductive Switching","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2477831","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7374779/07254217.pdf","startPage":"4526","endPage":"4535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2477831","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374779","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7254217","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7254217/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","displayDocTitle":"The Effect of Electrothermal Nonuniformities on Parallel Connected SiC Power Devices Under Unclamped and Clamped Inductive Switching","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7254217/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"15697310","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council"},{"fundingName":"Underpinning Power Electronics Devices Theme","grantNumber":"EP/L007010/1"},{"fundingName":"Components Theme","grantNumber":"EP/K034804/1 and EP/K008161/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effect of Electrothermal Nonuniformities on Parallel Connected SiC Power Devices Under Unclamped and Clamped Inductive Switching","sourcePdf":"tpel-hu-2477831-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068601S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7374779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"7374779","articleId":"7254217","onlineDate":"10 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7254218,"authors":[{"name":"Theodore Soong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7374779/7254218/soong-small.gif","p":["Theodore Soong (S\u201911) received the B.A.Sc. degree in\n engineering science, in 2009 and the M.A.Sc. degree in electrical engineering, in 2012, both from the University of\n Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","His research interest includes the integration of renewable resources to the grid and modular converters."]},"firstName":"Theodore","lastName":"Soong","id":"38490662800"},{"name":"Peter W.

In both cases, long-series connected strings of batteries are required to efficiently maintain the necessary dc-link voltage. Such configurations are susceptible to reliability issues, as shutdown of a battery string due to individual battery failure, overheating, or overcharging/discharging results in loss of a large fraction of ES capacity. To increase the reliability of an ES system, shorter strings of batteries are preferable. In this study, the ES is subdivided into many banks of short-series strings, which are integrated into the submodules of a modular multilevel converter (MMC). To further enhance the reliability, the MMC should also be unaffected by an ES bank shutdown. This paper investigates the robustness of the MMC to ES bank failure by assessing the power balance between submodules when a subset of ES banks is not operational. The analysis concludes that as many as 33% of ES banks may be shutdown without affecting MMC power exchange with the grid, and is supported with both simulation and experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2477834","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7374779/07254218.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2477834","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374779","startPage":"4085","endPage":"4095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Assessment of Fault Tolerance in Modular Multilevel Converters With Integrated Energy Storage","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7254218","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Assessment of Fault Tolerance in Modular Multilevel Converters With Integrated Energy Storage","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7254218/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"15697301","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7254218/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assessment of Fault Tolerance in Modular Multilevel Converters With Integrated Energy Storage","sourcePdf":"tpel-soong-2477834-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067691S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7374779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"7374779","articleId":"7254218","onlineDate":"10 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7254222,"authors":[{"name":"Yao Sun","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7394209/7254222/sun-small.gif","p":["Yao Sun (M'13) was born in Hunan, China, in 1981.

They have obtained a wide range of applications, such as photovoltaic (PV) systems, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) drivers, fuel cell (FC) power systems, and electric vehicle (EV) battery chargers, etc. This paper provides a comprehensive review of active power decoupling circuit topologies. They are categorized into two groups in terms of the structure characteristics: independent and dependent decoupling circuit topologies. The former operates independently with the original converter, and the latter, however, shares the power semiconductor devices with the original converter partially and even completely. The development laws for the active power decoupling topologies are revealed from the view of \u201cduality principle,\u201d \u201cswitches sharing,\u201d and \u201cdifferential connection.\u201d In addition, the exceptions and special cases are also briefly introduced. This paper is targeted to help researchers, engineers, and designers to construct some new decoupling circuit topologies and properly select existing ones according to the specific application.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2477882","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7394209/07254222.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2477882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7394209","startPage":"4778","endPage":"4794","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Review of Active Power Decoupling Topologies in Single-Phase Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7254222","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Review of Active Power Decoupling Topologies in Single-Phase Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7254222/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"15754660","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7254222/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61573382"},{"fundingName":"National High-tech R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2012AA051601"},{"fundingName":"Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"14JJ5035"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002822","fundingName":"Central South University","grantNumber":"2015CXS006"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Review of Active Power Decoupling Topologies in Single-Phase Systems","sourcePdf":"tpel-sun-2477882-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.240901S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7394209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"224","xplore-issue":"7394209","articleId":"7254222","onlineDate":"10 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":7254224,"authors":[{"name":"Jaeung Han","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, KAIST, Daejeon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4629386/7944974/7254224/han-2477835-small.gif","p":["Jaeung Han received the BS and MS degrees in computer science from\n the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in 2009 and 2011, respectively.

To satisfy different needs for computing resources, cloud providers provide many different types of virtual machines (VMs) with various numbers of computing cores and amounts of memory. The cost and execution time of a scientific application vary depending on the types of VMs, number of VMs, and current status of the cloud due to interference among VMs. However, currently, cloud users are solely responsible for selecting the most effective VM configuration for their needs, but often end up with sub-optimal selections. In this paper, using molecular dynamics simulations as a case study, we propose a framework to guide users to select the optimal VM configurations that satisfy their requirements for scientific parallel computing in virtualized clusters. For molecular dynamics computation on a cluster of VMs, the guidance framework uses artificial neural networks which are trained to predict its execution times for various inputs, VM configurations, and status of interference among VMs. Using our performance prediction mechanisms, the guidance framework helps users choose an optimal or near-optimal VM cluster configuration under cost and runtime constraints.","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2015.2477835","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4629386/7944974/07254224.pdf","startPage":"366","endPage":"380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2015.2477835","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7944974","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Configuration Guidance Framework for Molecular Dynamics Simulations in Virtualized Clusters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7254224","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7254224/","displayDocTitle":"Configuration Guidance Framework for Molecular Dynamics Simulations in Virtualized Clusters","volume":"10","issue":"3","publicationDate":"1 May-June 2017","accessionNumber":"16948569","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7254224/","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning","grantNumber":"NRF-2012R1A1A1043329 and NRF-2013R1A2A2A01015514"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002613","fundingName":"Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Configuration Guidance Framework for Molecular Dynamics Simulations in Virtualized Clusters","sourcePdf":"tsc-choi-2477835-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10854S","chronDate":"May-June 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"7944974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7944974","articleId":"7254224","onlineDate":"10 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7254226,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Xing","affiliation":["King's College London, Centre for Telecommunications Research"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Xing","id":"38666351700"},{"name":"Kai-Kit Wong","affiliation":["University College London, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"],"firstName":"Kai-Kit","lastName":"Wong","id":"37278682500"},{"name":"Zheng Chu","affiliation":["Newcastle University, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Chu","id":"37085347034"},{"name":"Arumugam Nallanathan","affiliation":["King's College London, Centre for Telecommunications Research"],"firstName":"Arumugam","lastName":"Nallanathan","id":"37269846800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"7254226","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":71,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2660},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7254226","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Jamming","Transmitters","Robustness","Wireless communication","Optimization","Communication system security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","covariance matrices","jamming","mathematical programming","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication security","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiantenna amplify-and-forward relay wiretap channel","multiantenna harvest-and-jam helpers","worst-case robust optimization","semidefinite relaxation","AF beamforming matrix","cooperative jamming","artificial noise covariance matrix","joint optimization","perfect channel state information","transmit power constraints","secrecy rate","secure AF relaying","self-sustaining friendly jammers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplify-and-forward relay","artificial noise","cooperative jamming","harvest-and-jam","physical-layer security","robust optimization","semidefinite relaxation","wireless energy transfer"]}],"abstract":"This paper studies the use of multi-antenna harvest-and-jam (HJ) helpers in a multi-antenna amplify-and-forward (AF) relay wiretap channel assuming that the direct link between the source and destination is broken. Our objective is to maximize the secrecy rate at the destination subject to the transmit power constraints of the AF relay and the HJ helpers. In the case of perfect channel state information (CSI), the joint optimization of the artificial noise (AN) covariance matrix for cooperative jamming and the AF beamforming matrix is studied using semidefinite relaxation (SDR) which is tight, while suboptimal solutions are also devised with lower complexity. For the imperfect CSI case, we provide the equivalent reformulation of the worst-case robust optimization to maximize the minimum achievable secrecy rate. Inspired by the optimal solution to the case of perfect CSI, a suboptimal robust scheme is proposed striking a good tradeoff between complexity and performance. Finally, numerical results for various settings are provided to evaluate the proposed schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2477800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7323913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2477800","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7323913/07254226.pdf","startPage":"6616","endPage":"6631","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"To Harvest and Jam: A Paradigm of Self-Sustaining Friendly Jammers for Secure AF Relaying","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"To Harvest and Jam: A Paradigm of Self-Sustaining Friendly Jammers for Secure AF Relaying","volume":"63","issue":"24","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15,  2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Dec.15, 2015","accessionNumber":"15598190","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7254226/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"To Harvest and Jam: A Paradigm of Self-Sustaining Friendly Jammers for Secure AF Relaying","sourcePdf":"tsp-wong-2477800-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097865S","chronDate":"Dec.15,  2015","isNumber":"7323913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"71","articleId":"7254226","onlineDate":"10 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7254229,"authors":[{"name":"Visar Berisha","affiliation":["Speech and Hearing Science, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, United States"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7360993/7254229/7254229-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Visar Berisha received the Ph.D. degree from Arizona State University, Tempe, USA, in 2007.","From 2007 to 2009, he was a member of the technical staff at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2014Lincoln Laboratory, Cambridge, USA.

The sparseness of the channel impulse response and prior information for the non-Gaussian channel gains, modeled by an exact continuous Gaussian mixture (CGM), are exploited to improve the performance of the channel estimation algorithm. The resulting novel algorithm initially estimates the overall sparse complex-valued channel taps from the source to the destination as well as their locations using the matching pursuit (MP) approach. The effective time-domain non-Gaussian noise is approximated well as a Gaussian noise in the frequency-domain, where the estimation takes place. An efficient and low complexity algorithm is developed based on a combination of the MP and the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) based space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization technique, to improve the estimates of the channel taps and their locations in an iterative manner. Computer simulations show that the UWA channel is estimated very effectively and the proposed algorithm exhibits excellent symbol error rate and channel estimation performance.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2477807","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7343816/07254230.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2477807","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7343816","startPage":"214","endPage":"228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Channel Estimation and Equalization for OFDM-Based Underwater Cooperative Systems With Amplify-and-Forward Relaying","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7254230","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Channel Estimation and Equalization for OFDM-Based Underwater Cooperative Systems With Amplify-and-Forward Relaying","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7254230/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"64","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2016","accessionNumber":"15647672","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7254230/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Turkish Scientific and Research Council TUBITAK","grantNumber":"110E092"},{"fundingName":"U S National Science Foundation NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-1420575 and  CNS-1456793 and ECCS-1343210."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Channel Estimation and Equalization for OFDM-Based Underwater Cooperative Systems With Amplify-and-Forward Relaying","sourcePdf":"tsp-panayirci-2477807-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.212157S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7343816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7343816","articleId":"7254230","onlineDate":"10 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7254231,"authors":[{"name":"Heeseong Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Yuseong-Gu, Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7343816/7254231/7254231-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Heeseong Yang received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2010 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2012, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include RADAR signal processing, array signal processing, and MIMO communications."]},"firstName":"Heeseong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085350243"},{"name":"Joohwan Chun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Yuseong-Gu, Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7343816/7254231/7254231-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Joohwan Chun (SM'09) received the Ph.D. degree from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 1989.

The method is based on the well-known two-stage weighted least squares (2SWLS) method, but in contrast to the recently proposed Group-2SWLS, it requires only one reference transmitter (or receiver) without grouping and combining. This change allows us to obtain a closed-form solution which is less likely to be degraded by bias. Furthermore, the proposed method can easily utilize not only time-of-arrival (TOA) and frequency-of-arrival (FOA) data but also time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) and frequency-difference-of-arrival (FDOA) data. We also introduce new auxiliary variables for the purpose of numerical stability; our method using the auxiliary variables is shown to be numerically more stable than the Group-2SWLS, while attaining the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) at higher noise levels. The adoption of auxiliary variables requires no additional computations in contrast to the adoption of the concept of Turbo-2SWLS for the same purpose.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7254231/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2016","volume":"64","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15647669","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7254231/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Algebraic Solution for Moving Target Localization in Noncoherent MIMO Radar Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Algebraic Solution for Moving Target Localization in Noncoherent MIMO Radar Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-chun-2477803-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088413S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7343816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"7343816","articleId":"7254231","onlineDate":"10 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7254232,"authors":[{"name":"Ziv Alina","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Tel Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Ziv Alina received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and the B.A. degree in physics in 2006 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering in 2015, all from Tel Aviv University, Israel.","He is currently with Qualcomm working as an algorithm engineer."]},"firstName":"Ziv","lastName":"Alina","id":"37085567028"},{"name":"Ofer Amrani","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Tel Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Ofer Amrani received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel, in 2000.","In 2001, he joined the School of Electrical Engineering, Tel-Aviv University.

This reverse power flow causes the voltage rise problem. In this paper, we study the use of demand side management to mitigate the voltage rise problem. We propose an autonomous energy consumption scheduling algorithm, which schedules the operation of deferrable loads to jointly shave the peak load and reduce the reverse power flow. The proposed algorithm shifts the operation of deferrable loads from peak consumption hours to hours with high-power generation from the PV units. We use stochastic programming to formulate an energy consumption scheduling problem, which takes into account the uncertainty related to the amount of power generation from PV units. The formulated cost function comprises a monetary cost for energy consumption, the revenue from energy export, and an external cost for the voltage rise.

Due to the unipolarity of optical signals, a direct current (DC) offset along with proper clipping is adopted in DCO-OFDM. A high DC-offset causes a waste of power and a low DC-offset causes a severe clipping distortion. Thus, the DC-offset and information-carrying power shall be jointly optimized to balance clipping distortion and power consumption. We consider the offset and power optimization problem under the optical and/or electrical power constraints over flat and dispersive channels. In the flat case, we analytically characterize the optimal solution, based on which several important insights are provided. We also investigate the relation and impact of the two constraints, and propose efficient algorithms to obtain the optimal solution. In the dispersive case, we identify the scope of the optimal solution, and provide efficient algorithms to jointly optimize the offset and power. The optimality and superiority of the proposed methods are validated by numerical results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7254237/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15,  2016","volume":"64","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15663187","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Jan.15, 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7254237/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Offset and Power Optimization for DCO-OFDM in Visible Light Communication Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Offset and Power Optimization for DCO-OFDM in Visible Light Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-wang-2477799-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.177571S","chronDate":"Jan.15,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7358222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"7358222","articleId":"7254237","onlineDate":"10 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7254238,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Xiong","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7254238/xiong-2477683-small.gif","p":["\n\nXin Xiong (S'14) received the B.S. degree in communication engineering \nfrom the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2011.

We investigate a quality of service (QoS) guaranteed user-scheduling algorithm for large-scale MIMO-OFDM systems, where pilots are assigned to served users. In general, a wireless channel concentrates its energy on a specific region in the angle and delay domains. We suggest to reuse pilots based on this channel property in a macrocellular environment, thus reducing pilot overhead significantly. In the presence of contamination caused by the pilot reuse, we analyze the asymptotic behavior and design an interference cancelation (IC) precoder. For both the simple matched filter (MF) precoder and the sophisticated IC precoder, we derive achievable rates under pilot contamination, which are metrics for QoS. Further, according to the analysis under a special case, the number of QoS-guaranteed users proves to be maximized when an equispaced property in the angle domain is satisfied. The theoretical result facilitates a low-complexity user-scheduling algorithm.

Furthermore, we conceive a new outage-based characterization approach for the JRJS scheme. The traditional best relay selection (TBRS) is also considered as a benchmark. We first derive closed-form expressions of both the connection outage probability (COP) and the secrecy outage probability (SOP) for both the TBRS and JRJS schemes. Then, a reliable and secure connection probability (RSCP) is defined and analyzed for characterizing the effect of the correlation between the COP and the SOP introduced by the corporate source-relay link. The reliability-security ratio (RSR) is introduced for characterizing the relationship between the reliability and the security through asymptotic analysis. Moreover, the concept of effective secrecy throughput is defined as the product of the secrecy rate and of the RSCP for the sake of characterizing the overall efficiency of the system, as determined by the transmit SNR, the secrecy codeword rate, and the power sharing ratio between the relay and the jammer. The impact of the direct source-eavesdropper link and additional performance comparisons with respect to other related selection schemes are also included. Our numerical results show that the JRJS scheme outperforms the TBRS method both in terms of the RSCP and in terms of its effective secrecy throughput, but it is more sensitive to the feedback delays. Increasing the transmit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) will not always improve the overall throughput. Moreover, the RSR results demonstrate that, upon reducing the CSI feedback delays, the reliability improves more substantially than the security degrades, implying an overall improvement in terms of the security-reliability tradeoff. Additionally, the secrecy throughput loss due to the second-hop feedback delay is more pronounced than that due to the first-hop one.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2478029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2478029","startPage":"6259","endPage":"6274","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7542099/07254240.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Relay and Jammer Selection Improves the Physical Layer Security in the Face of CSI Feedback Delays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7254240/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Joint Relay and Jammer Selection Improves the Physical Layer Security in the Face of CSI Feedback Delays","volume":"65","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","accessionNumber":"16210051","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7254240/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61371122, 61471393 and 61501512"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20150718 and BK20150040"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Relay and Jammer Selection Improves the Physical Layer Security in the Face of CSI Feedback Delays","sourcePdf":"tvt-hanzo-2478029-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132205S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7254240","onlineDate":"10 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7254241,"authors":[{"name":"Jaheon Gu","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7374774/7254241/jahgu-2477998-small.gif","p":["Jaheon Gu received the B.S. degree in electronic and electrical engineering, and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2010 and 2012, respectively.

The secure EE is maximized by joint source and relay power allocation, which is a nonconvex optimization problem. To cope with this difficulty, a solution scheme and corresponding algorithms are developed by jointly applying fractional programming, exact penalty, alternate search, and difference of convex functions programming. The key idea of the scheme is to convert the primal problem into simple subproblems step by step, such that related methods are adopted. It is verified that, compared with secrecy rate maximization, the proposed scheme improves the secure EE significantly yet with a certain loss of the secrecy rate due to the tradeoff between secure EE and secrecy rate. Furthermore, the proposed scheme achieves higher secure EE and secrecy rate than total transmission power minimization does, while with a certain increase of power consumption. These results indicate that a reasonable balance among secure EE, secrecy rate, and power consumption can be reached by the proposed scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achieving High Energy Efficiency and Physical-Layer Security in AF Relaying","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2477510","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7374774/07254242.pdf","startPage":"740","endPage":"752","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2477510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374774","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7254242","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7254242/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Achieving High Energy Efficiency and Physical-Layer Security in AF Relaying","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7254242/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15697445","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2012CB316000 and 2013CB336600"},{"fundingName":"NSFC Young Investigator","grantNumber":"61401249"},{"fundingName":"NSFC Excellent Young Investigator","grantNumber":"61322111"},{"fundingName":"NSFC Innovative Research Groups","grantNumber":"61321061"},{"fundingName":"MoE Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (SRFDP)","grantNumber":"20130002120001"},{"fundingName":"MoE New Century Talent","grantNumber":"NCET-12-0302"},{"fundingName":"National Innovative Talents Promotion","grantNumber":"2013RA2151"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005090","fundingName":"Beijing Nova","grantNumber":"Z121101002512051"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-1456921, CNS-1443917, ECCS-1405121, ECCS 1547201 and NSFC 61428101"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achieving High Energy Efficiency and Physical-Layer Security in AF Relaying","sourcePdf":"twc-bai-2477510-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109813S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7374774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7374774","articleId":"7254242","onlineDate":"10 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7254243,"authors":[{"name":"Zhifeng He","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7374774/7254243/zhihe-2477509-small.gif","p":["Zhifeng He (S\u201915) received the B.S. degree in electronics information science and technology from Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, China, and the M.S. degree in micro electronics and solid state electronics from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2009 and 2012, respectively.

Spectrum sensing, channel assignment, and power allocation strategies are jointly optimized to maximize the quality of service (QoS) for the CUs. We show that the formulated mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem can be decomposed into two subproblems: 1) SP1 for the optimal spectrum sensing strategy and 2) SP2 for the optimal channel assignment and power allocation, without sacrificing optimality. We show that SP1 can be optimally solved if there is no restriction on the sensing capability for each CU, and develop a column generation (CG)-based algorithm to solve SP2 iteratively in a distributed manner. We also develop a heuristic algorithm for spectrum sensing with greatly reduced requirement on CU hardware, while still achieving a highly competitive sensing performance. We analyze the proposed algorithms with respect to complexity and time efficiency, and derive a performance upper bound. The proposed algorithms are validated with simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2477509","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7374774/07254243.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2477509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374774","startPage":"728","endPage":"739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Decomposition Approach to Quality-Driven Multiuser Video Streaming in Cellular Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7254243","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Decomposition Approach to Quality-Driven Multiuser Video Streaming in Cellular Cognitive Radio Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7254243/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15697450","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7254243/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)","grantNumber":"CNS-0953513"},{"fundingName":"Wireless Engineering Research and Education Center (WEREC)"},{"fundingName":"11th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems (MASS 2014)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Decomposition Approach to Quality-Driven Multiuser Video Streaming in Cellular Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-mao-2477509-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093964S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7374774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7374774","articleId":"7254243","onlineDate":"10 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7254251,"authors":[{"name":"Juan Mata Pavia","affiliation":["University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland","Division of Neonatology, Biomedical Optics Research Laboratory, Zurich, Switzerland","Klinik f\u00fcr Neonatologie, Universit\u00e4tsSpital Z\u00fcrich, Schlieren, Switzerland","Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Quantum Architecture Group (AQUA), Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7279217/7254251/7254251-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Juan Mata Pavia received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden, and the telecommunications engineering diploma from the Polytechnic University of Valencia (UPV), Valencia, Spain, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, France, in 2015.","He is currently with the University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, where he is investigating the design of new single-photon detectors and their application in biomedical imaging.

The objects in the set are designed to cover a wide range of aspects of the manipulation problem. The set includes objects of daily life with different shapes, sizes, textures, weights, and rigidities as well as some widely used manipulation tests. The associated database provides high-resolution red, green, blue, plus depth (RGB-D) scans, physical properties, and geometric models of the objects for easy incorporation into manipulation and planning software platforms. In addition to describing the objects and models in the set along with how they were chosen and derived, we provide a framework and a number of example task protocols, laying out how the set can be used to quantitatively evaluate a range of manipulation approaches, including planning, learning, mechanical design, control, and many others. A comprehensive literature survey on the existing benchmarks and object data sets is also presented, and their scope and limitations are discussed. The YCB set will be freely distributed to research groups worldwide at a series of tutorials at robotics conferences. Subsequent sets will be, otherwise, available to purchase at a reasonable cost. It is our hope that the ready availability of this set along with the ground laid in terms of protocol templates will enable the community of manipulation researchers to more easily compare approaches as well as continually evolve standardized benchmarking tests and metrics as the field matures.","doi":"10.1109/MRA.2015.2448951","publicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/100/7254280/07254318.pdf","startPage":"36","endPage":"52","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MRA.2015.2448951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7254280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Benchmarking in Manipulation Research: Using the Yale-CMU-Berkeley Object and Model Set","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7254318","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7254318/","displayDocTitle":"Benchmarking in Manipulation Research: Using the Yale-CMU-Berkeley Object and Model Set","volume":"22","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15439738","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7254318/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Benchmarking in Manipulation Research: Using the Yale-CMU-Berkeley Object and Model Set","sourcePdf":"22mra03-calli-2448951-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.298189S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"100","isNumber":"7254280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"100","citationCount":"195","xplore-issue":"7254280","articleId":"7254318","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7254324,"authors":[{"name":"Davide Brugali","affiliation":["University of Bergamo, Italy"],"firstName":"Davide","lastName":"Brugali","id":"37326280900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9932"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-223X"}],"articleNumber":"7254324","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":943},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"}],"abstract":"A model is an abstract representation of a real system or phenomenon [1].

Two-layer decoding is proposed. First, for all active mobile stations (MSs) the spatial streams are decoupled at the pre-assigned base stations (BSs) by using a zero-forcing (ZF) type algorithm. Second, for MSs with strong signals, hard-decision decoding is performed at the BSs; while for other MSs, especially those at the edge of the cells, soft decisions from multiple BSs are passed to the WC, where maximum ratio combining (MRC) is performed. When deploying MRC, two strategies are considered to deal with the inter-cell interference (ICI). Assuming access at the WC to hard-decoded user data, or the lack of it, MRC with successive interference cancellation (SIC) and conventional MRC are investigated, respectively. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the potential of the technique developed in terms of total system sum rate performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 14th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory (CWIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7237119/7255133/07255158.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"87","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 14th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory (CWIT)","doi":"10.1109/CWIT.2015.7255158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CWIT.2015.7255158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7255133","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7255158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uplink scheduling in multi-cell MU-MIMO systems with ZF post-processing and diversity combining","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Optical wavelength conversion","Interference","Wireless communication","Signal to noise ratio","Silicon carbide"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","decoding","diversity reception","interference suppression","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Uplink Scheduling","multicell MU-MIMO system","ZF post-processing","diversity combining","uplink decoding","multiuser multiple input multiple output multicell system","wireless network","wireless controller","WC","two-layer decoding","active mobile station","MS","base station","zero-forcing type algorithm","hard-decision decoding","maximum ratio combining","MRC","intercell interference","ICI","successive interference cancellation","SIC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7255158/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Uplink scheduling in multi-cell MU-MIMO systems with ZF post-processing and diversity combining","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7255158/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15455262","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink scheduling in multi-cell MU-MIMO systems with ZF post-processing and diversity combining","confLoc":"St. John's, NL, Canada","sourcePdf":"1570089811.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047954S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7237119","isNumber":"7255133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7237119","xplore-issue":"7255133","articleId":"7255158","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7255161,"authors":[{"name":"Mostafa Mohammadkarimi","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, Memorial University St. John's, NL, Canada"],"firstName":"Mostafa","lastName":"Mohammadkarimi","id":"37589788900"},{"name":"Octavia A.

Simulation results show that when compared with the existing methods, such as the fourth-order lag product and second-order cyclostationarity-based methods, the proposed non-parametric method exhibits a superior performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Block codes","Modulation","Signal to noise ratio","Fading","Transmitting antennas","Nickel","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","linear codes","space-time block codes","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind identification","linear space-time block codes","binary tree","decision making","empirical cumulative distribution functions","received signal statistics","modulation format","carrier frequency offset","fourth-order lag product","second-order cyclostationarity-based methods","STBC codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Signal identification","Non-parametric test","Kolmogrov-Smirnov test","Space-time block coding"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CWIT.2015.7255161","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 14th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory (CWIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 14th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory (CWIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7237119/7255133/07255161.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7255133","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CWIT.2015.7255161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel non-parametric method for blind identification of STBC codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7255161","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel non-parametric method for blind identification of STBC codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7255161/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7255161/","accessionNumber":"15455259","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel non-parametric method for blind identification of STBC codes","confLoc":"St. John's, NL, Canada","sourcePdf":"1570086771.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054384S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7237119","isNumber":"7255133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7237119","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7255133","articleId":"7255161","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7255162,"authors":[{"name":"Aasem N.

At the base station (BS), zero-forcing (ZF) with singular value decomposition (SVD) decoupling of spatial streams is deployed. First, two algorithms are developed for mobile stations (MS)s and their corresponding antennas assignment as well as power allocation. The objective is to maximize the total system sum rate by considering the impact of multiple access noise enhancement on the spatial stream capacity. Then, an additional scheme is proposed to maximize the weighted sum capacity of all admitted users, where the weights are chosen based on the state of users' buffers. The proposed resource allocation and scheduling algorithms operate in a reduced search space for the sub-optimum configurations targeting lower overall complexity but still offering close to optimum results in a statistical sense. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the potential of the developed technique in terms of total system sum rate performance and the buffer behavior.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 14th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory (CWIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7237119/7255133/07255162.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"105","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 14th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory (CWIT)","doi":"10.1109/CWIT.2015.7255162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CWIT.2015.7255162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7255133","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7255162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial stream scheduling in uplink multiuser MIMO systems with zero-forcing post-processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antennas","Noise","Resource management","Algorithm design and analysis","MIMO","Decoding","Uplink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","radiofrequency interference","resource allocation","singular value decomposition","statistical analysis","telecommunication scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial stream scheduling","uplink multiuser MIMO system","zero-forcing postprocessing","interference-aware user selection","resource allocation","uplink multiuser multiple input multiple output system","base station","BS","ZF","singular value decomposition decoupling","SVD decoupling","mobile station","MS","antennas assignment","power allocation","multiple access noise enhancement","spatial stream capacity","weighted sum capacity maximization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7255162/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Spatial stream scheduling in uplink multiuser MIMO systems with zero-forcing post-processing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7255162/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15455230","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial stream scheduling in uplink multiuser MIMO systems with zero-forcing post-processing","confLoc":"St. John's, NL, Canada","sourcePdf":"1570089267.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050354S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7237119","isNumber":"7255133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7237119","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7255133","articleId":"7255162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7255163,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Rice","affiliation":["Brigham Young University, Provo, UT"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Rice","id":"37085495623"},{"name":"Jacob Frogget","affiliation":["Brigham Young University, Provo, UT"],"firstName":"Jacob","lastName":"Frogget","id":"37085623959"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6560-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6559-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7255163","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency modulation","Histograms","Phase modulation","Phase change materials","Telemetry","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","telemetry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radios","aeronautical telemetry","modulation classifier","CPM","IRIG 106","discrete phase shift","Kullback-Leibler distance","signal-to-noise ratio"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7255163","doi":"10.1109/CWIT.2015.7255163","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 14th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory (CWIT)","abstract":"A novel modulation classifier for the three CPMs described in IRIG 106 is developed.

The construction introduced stores messages as cliques of small size which can be retrieved in spite of partial error. We improve on the success of retrieving learnt messages by doing a local coding and by mapping codewords of a code on an extension field of G F (2) in clusters. We also use the fractal approach and a slightly different decoding scheme, which is appropriate for partial erasures, in order to reduce the complexity of retrieval.

This scenario is motivated by the possibility of using device-to-device links for inter-cell interference mitigation in cellular networks. We characterize the necessary and sufficient conditions on the number of antennas under which the relay link rate can result in a near one-to-one improvement to the overall throughput in the high signal-to-noise-ratio and interference-to-noise-ratio regime. We show that these conditions coincide with the necessary and sufficient condition under which full cooperation between relay and destination can improve the degrees of freedom of the relay channel. Simultaneous diagonalization by *congruence enables this characterization.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 14th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory (CWIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7237119/7255133/07255181.pdf","startPage":"182","endPage":"185","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 14th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory (CWIT)","doi":"10.1109/CWIT.2015.7255181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CWIT.2015.7255181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7255133","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7255181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A DoF analysis of compress-and-forward in MIMO Gaussian relay channel with correlated noises","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Interference","MIMO","Antennas","Noise","Quantization (signal)","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian channels","interference suppression","MIMO communication","radio links","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compress-and-forward relaying scheme","multiple-input multiple-output Gaussian relay channel","MIMO Gaussian relay channel","out-of-band finite-capacity relay-to-destination link","device-to-device links","intercell interference mitigation","cellular networks","relay link rate","signal-to-noise-ratio","interference-to-noise-ratio regime","DoF analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7255181/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"A DoF analysis of compress-and-forward in MIMO Gaussian relay channel with correlated noises","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7255181/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15455247","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A DoF analysis of compress-and-forward in MIMO Gaussian relay channel with correlated noises","confLoc":"St. John's, NL, Canada","sourcePdf":"1570090925.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049356S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7237119","isNumber":"7255133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7237119","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7255133","articleId":"7255181","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7255196,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Cao","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts, Lowell, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Yu Cao","id":"37085461271"},{"name":"Songqing Chen","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA"],"lastName":"Songqing Chen","id":"37085688845"},{"name":"Peng Hou","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts, Lowell, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Peng Hou","id":"37085693690"},{"name":"Donald Brown","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts, Lowell, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Donald","lastName":"Brown","id":"37085686745"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7891-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7890-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7255196","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1588},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart phones","Sensors","Accelerometers","Detection algorithms","Monitoring","Brain models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","decision making","medical computing","real-time systems","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fog computing assisted distributed analytics system","FAST","stroke mitigation","cloud computing","cloud services","edge intelligence","pervasive health monitoring applications","biomarkers","smart care decision making","acceleration magnitude values","nonlinear time series analysis techniques","real-time fall detection system","edge devices","smartphones","stroke patients","patient-centered design","response time","energy consumption"]}],"abstract":"Fog computing is a recently proposed computing paradigm that extends Cloud computing and services to the edge of the network. The new features offered by fog computing (e.g., distributed analytics and edge intelligence), if successfully applied for pervasive health monitoring applications, has great potential to accelerate the discovery of early predictors and novel biomarkers to support smart care decision making in a connected health scenarios. While promising, how to design and develop real-word fog computing-based pervasive health monitoring system is still an open question. As a first step to answer this question, in this paper, we employ pervasive fall detection for stroke mitigation as a case in study. There are four major contributions in this paper: (1) to investigate and develop a set of new fall detection algorithms, including new fall detection algorithms based on acceleration magnitude values and non-linear time series analysis techniques, as well as new filtering techniques to facilitate fall detection process; (2) to design and employ a real-time fall detection system employing fog computing paradigm, which distribute the analytics throughout the network by splitting the detection task between the edge devices (e.g., smartphones attached to the user) and the server (e.g., servers in the cloud); (3) we carefully exam the special needs and constraints of stroke patients and propose patient-centered design that is minimal intrusive to patients. This type of patient-centered design is currently lacking in most of the existing work; and (4) our experiments with real-word data show that our proposed system achieves the high sensitivity (low missing rate) while it also achieves the high specificity (low false alarm rate). At the same time, the response time and energy consumption of our system are close to the minimum of the existing approaches.","doi":"10.1109/NAS.2015.7255196","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Architecture and Storage (NAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Architecture and Storage (NAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7235962/7255186/07255196.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAS.2015.7255196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7255186","startPage":"2","endPage":"11","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FAST: A fog computing assisted distributed analytics system to monitor fall for stroke mitigation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7255196","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FAST: A fog computing assisted distributed analytics system to monitor fall for stroke mitigation","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7255196/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-7 Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15455186","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7255196/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FAST: A fog computing assisted distributed analytics system to monitor fall for stroke mitigation","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"102CaoB.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086315S","chronDate":"6-7 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7235962","isNumber":"7255186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7235962","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7255186","articleId":"7255196","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7255198,"authors":[{"name":"Dongyang Li","affiliation":["University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, US"],"lastName":"Dongyang Li"},{"name":"Qingbo Wang","affiliation":["Storage Architecture Research Group, HGST, a Western Digital Company, San Jose, CA, 95135, USA"],"lastName":"Qingbo Wang"},{"name":"Cyril Guyot","affiliation":["Storage Architecture Research Group, HGST, a Western Digital Company, San Jose, CA, 95135, USA"],"firstName":"Cyril","lastName":"Guyot"},{"name":"Ashwin Narasimha","affiliation":["Storage Architecture Research Group, HGST, a Western Digital Company, San Jose, CA, 95135, USA"],"firstName":"Ashwin","lastName":"Narasimha"},{"name":"Dejan Vucinic","affiliation":["Storage Architecture Research Group, HGST, a Western Digital Company, San Jose, CA, 95135, USA"],"firstName":"Dejan","lastName":"Vucinic"},{"name":"Zvonimir Bandic","affiliation":["Storage Architecture Research Group, HGST, a Western Digital Company, San Jose, CA, 95135, USA"],"firstName":"Zvonimir","lastName":"Bandic"},{"name":"Qing Yang","affiliation":["University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, US"],"lastName":"Qing Yang"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7891-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7890-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7255198","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","field programmable gate arrays","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware accelerator","similarity based data dedupe","data deduplication","backup storage systems","data chunks","primary storage","storage caches","compute-intensive kernel modules","sketch computation","data blocks","index searching","reference block","delta encoding","pipelined computation","parallel data lookup","multiple hardware modules","HW design","high throughput data traffic","multiple data units","wire speed dedupe","data stream","PC host system","PCIe Gen 2x4 interface","data reduction ratio","FPGA implementation","software implementation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data deduplication","Fingerprinting","multiple lookup dictionary","Cache","PCIe"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7255198","abstract":"Data deduplication has proven important in backup storage systems as large amount of identical or similar data chunks exist. Recent studies have shown the great potential of data deduplication in primary storage and storage caches. Deduplications in these environments require high speed processing not to drag down production performance. This paper presents a hardware accelerator for similarity based data deduplication. It implements three compute-intensive kernel modules to improve throughput and latency in dedupe systems: sketch computation for data blocks, index searching for reference block, and delta encoding over similar blocks. Adopting pipelined computation and parallel data lookup across multiple hardware modules, our HW design is capable of processing high throughput data traffic by working on multiple data units concurrently, thus enabling wire speed dedupe for data stream where similar blocks present. Using a PC host system connected to the FPGA-based accelerator through a PCIe Gen 2\u00d74 interface, our experiments show that the similarity based data dedupe performs 30% better in data reduction ratio than conventional dedupe techniques that look at identical blocks only. By comparing the hardware implementation with its software counterpart, the experimental results show that our preliminary FPGA implementation with maximum clock speed of 250MHz achieves at least 6 times improvement in latency over the software implementation running on state-of-art servers.","doi":"10.1109/NAS.2015.7255198","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Architecture and Storage (NAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Architecture and Storage (NAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7235962/7255186/07255198.pdf","startPage":"224","endPage":"232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7255186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAS.2015.7255198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware accelerator for similarity based data dedupe","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7255198/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Hardware accelerator for similarity based data dedupe","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7255198/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15455175","conferenceDate":"6-7 Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware accelerator for similarity based data dedupe","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"104LiB.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061655S","chronDate":"6-7 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7235962","isNumber":"7255186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7235962","xplore-issue":"7255186","articleId":"7255198","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7255200,"authors":[{"name":"Shishi Tan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","Data Storage System Laboratory, Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Shishi Tan","id":"37085659237"},{"name":"Ruirong Yu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","Data Storage System Laboratory, Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Ruirong Yu","id":"37085660748"},{"name":"Shenggang Wan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","Data Storage System Laboratory, Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Shenggang Wan","id":"37403130800"},{"name":"Qiang Cao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","Data Storage System Laboratory, Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Qiang Cao","id":"37397318100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7891-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7890-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7255200","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":203},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ash","Redundancy","Strips","Error correction codes","Bit error rate","Error correction","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories","NAND circuits","redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MLC NAND flash SSDs","low life endurance","hierarchical data redundancy","heterogeneous flash memory techniques","spinning HDDs","in-page ECCs","H2-SSD","across-chips data redundancy","high program-erase performance","SLC chip","I/O performance degradation","strict synchronous parity update strategy","trace-driven simulation","multilevel cell"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7255200","abstract":"As an alternative to conventional spinning HDDs, MLC NAND flash memory based SSDs suffer from a low life endurance. To cost-effectively address this problem, we propose integrating both Hierarchical data redundancy and Heterogeneous flash memory techniques into those SSDs, named as H2-SSD. By deploying across-chips data redundancy in addition to the conventional in-page ECCs, the error correction capacity of H2-SSD can be dramatically enhanced. As a result, the life endurance can be significantly improved. Furthermore, an extra small sized SLC chip is deployed in H2-SSD to store the across-chips parity. Due to the high Program/Erase performance and life endurance of that SLC chip, the degradation of I/O performance induced by the hierarchical data redundancy will be slight in most cases, even under a strict synchronous parity update strategy. Both quantitatively analysis and trace-driven simulation are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of H2-SSD. The results demonstrate that H2-SSD outperforms the conventional SSDs in the maximum Program/Erase cycles by 23% to 178% and suffer from a less than 10% degradation of I/O performance under most cases.","doi":"10.1109/NAS.2015.7255200","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Architecture and Storage (NAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Architecture and Storage (NAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7235962/7255186/07255200.pdf","startPage":"336","endPage":"344","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7255186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAS.2015.7255200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost-effectively improving life endurance of MLC NAND flash SSDs via hierarchical data redundancy and heterogeneous flash memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7255200/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Cost-effectively improving life endurance of MLC NAND flash SSDs via hierarchical data redundancy and heterogeneous flash memory","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7255200/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15455208","conferenceDate":"6-7 Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-effectively improving life endurance of MLC NAND flash SSDs via hierarchical data redundancy and heterogeneous flash memory","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"107TanB.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079718S","chronDate":"6-7 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7235962","isNumber":"7255186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7235962","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7255186","articleId":"7255200","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7255204,"authors":[{"name":"Meng Zhang","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Meng Zhang","id":"37085658418"},{"name":"Fei Wu","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Fei Wu","id":"37591624600"},{"name":"Changsheng Xie","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Changsheng Xie","id":"37085358267"},{"name":"You Zhou","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"You Zhou","id":"37085660302"},{"name":"Kai Zou","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Kai Zou","id":"37085665358"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7891-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7890-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7255204","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":380},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BCH codes","decoding","error correction codes","fault tolerance","flash memories","NAND circuits","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Chien search process","NAND flash memory devices","write interference","read interference","erase operations","data integrity","flash memory lifetime","error correction codes","ECC","flash controller","fault tolerance","Bose Chaudhuri Hochquenghem code","decoding","parallel Chien search algorithms","decoding logic","hardware complexity","energy consumption","plane optimization algorithm","redundant XOR gate reduction","(2047,1926, 11) BCH code","GMA approach","strength-reduced architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NAND flash memory","BCH code","Chien search","error locator polynomial","finite field multiplier"]}],"abstract":"As NAND flash memory chips become denser, they are more vulnerable to random errors caused by ageing, read or write interference, and erase operations. These errors compromise both the data integrity and lifetime of flash memory so that error correction codes (ECC) are employed by the flash controller to strengthen the fault tolerance. The BCH (Bose Chaudhuri Hochquenghem) code is a widely used ECC technique in flash-based storage devices due to its strong error correction capability and high performance. The third step of decoding a BCH code is the Chien search process, which locates the errors in the received codeword. To increase the decoding throughput, parallel Chien search algorithms are used, but existing algorithms occupy more than 60% area of the total decoding logic, increasing the hardware complexity and energy consumption. To reduce the hardware complexity and overhead, in this paper, we propose a plane optimization algorithm to reduce the redundant XOR gates used in the Chien search process. Our study based on intensive experiments shows that for a (2047,1926, 11) BCH code with the parallel factor of 32, the proposed optimization algorithm reduces the number of XOR gates used in the Chien search process by 79%, 46% and 13%, respectively, compared to the straightforward implementation, the GMA approach and the strength-reduced architecture.","doi":"10.1109/NAS.2015.7255204","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Architecture and Storage (NAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Architecture and Storage (NAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7235962/7255186/07255204.pdf","startPage":"106","endPage":"111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7255186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAS.2015.7255204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel optimization algorithm for Chien search of BCH Codes in NAND flash memory devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7255204","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"A novel optimization algorithm for Chien search of BCH Codes in NAND flash memory devices","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7255204/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15455185","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7255204/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-7 Aug. 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel optimization algorithm for Chien search of BCH Codes in NAND flash memory devices","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"20ZhangMengB.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064353S","chronDate":"6-7 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7235962","isNumber":"7255186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7235962","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7255186","articleId":"7255204","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7255223,"authors":[{"name":"Chundong Wang","affiliation":["Data Storage Institute, A*STAR, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chundong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085673596"},{"name":"Qingsong Wei","affiliation":["Data Storage Institute, A*STAR, Singapore"],"firstName":"Qingsong","lastName":"Wei","id":"37604257500"},{"name":"Jun Yang","affiliation":["Data Storage Institute, A*STAR, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085665671"},{"name":"Cheng Chen","affiliation":["Data Storage Institute, A*STAR, Singapore"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37071367800"},{"name":"Mingdi Xue","affiliation":["Data Storage Institute, A*STAR, Singapore"],"firstName":"Mingdi","lastName":"Xue","id":"37085657787"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7891-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7890-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7255223","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":298},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7255223","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Nonvolatile memory","Bandwidth","Performance evaluation","Metadata","File systems","Band-pass filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonvolatile memory","NVM","byte-addressable memory","persistent memory","PM","in-memory file system","CPU","consistency mechanisms","journaling","copy-on-write","cacheline flush","memory fence instructions","clflush","sfence","ordered writes","performance perspective","data management strategies"]}],"abstract":"The advent of the byte-addressable, non-volatile memory (NVM) has initiated the design of new data management strategies to utilize it as the persistent memory (PM). One way to manage the PM is via an in-memory file system. The consistency of the in-memory file system may nevertheless be compromised from directly exposing the PM to the CPU, because data are likely to be flushed from the CPU cache to the PM in an order that is different from the order in which they have been programed to be. As a result, in spite of classic consistency mechanisms, such as journaling and Copy-on-Write, file systems for the PM have to seek support of cacheline flush and memory fence instructions, e.g., clflush and sfence, to achieve ordered writes. On the other hand, manipulating the PM as a consistent block device with conventional file systems is also doable. The pros and cons of two approaches, however, have not been thoroughly investigated yet. We hence do so with extensive evaluations and detailed analyses. Our aim of this paper is to inspire how the PM shall be managed, especially from the performance perspective.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAS.2015.7255223","doi":"10.1109/NAS.2015.7255223","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Architecture and Storage (NAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7235962/7255186/07255223.pdf","startPage":"186","endPage":"194","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Architecture and Storage (NAS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7255186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How to be consistent with persistent memory?

The gains in the current protocols, however, are incremental and limited to a specific range of loads. Using an analytical framework, we first examine the main sources of performance degradation specific to LR-PONs. From this, we conclude that there is a large scope for improvement in the performance by using an optimal cycle length, which is not influenced by reach, and which polls users according to their reported load while providing opportunities for pre-granting bandwidth at the optical network units. The fraction of bandwidth that is pre-granted should be decreased with load. To tailor these optimal design concepts in a DBA algorithm, we propose Synergized-Adaptive Multi-GATE polling with Void-filling (S-AMGAV), which reduces both the delay bound and packet loss rate by at least 50% when compared to the state-of-the-art DBAs like interleaved polling with adaptive cycle time (IPACT), IPACT with grant estimation (IPACT-GE), multi-thread polling (MTP), double phase polling (DPP), gate driven (GD), and AMGAV. S-AMGAV also maintains simplicity of the protocol while removing bandwidth inefficiencies prevailing in the existing protocols. We verify the usefulness of the algorithm through both analytical modeling and simulations.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563700/7255246/07255251.pdf","startPage":"837","endPage":"850","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.7.000837","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.7.000837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7255246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synergized-adaptive multi-GATE polling with void filling: Overcoming performance degradation in LR-PONs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7255251/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Synergized-adaptive multi-GATE polling with void filling: Overcoming performance degradation in LR-PONs","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15439802","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synergized-adaptive multi-GATE polling with void filling: Overcoming performance degradation in LR-PONs","sourcePdf":"837.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084747S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","isNumber":"7255246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"4","articleId":"7255251","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":7255257,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Shang","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Shang"},{"name":"Yintang Yang","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Yintang","lastName":"Yang"},{"name":"Guang Ren","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Guang","lastName":"Ren"},{"name":"Bo Hu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Application Technology, The People's Liberation Army Institute of Equipment Command, Beijing 101416, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Hu"},{"name":"Tao Ding","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Ding"},{"name":"Wenwen Chen","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Wenwen","lastName":"Chen"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-0620"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0639"}],"articleNumber":"7255257","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":463},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Network topology","Mobile communication","Mobile computing","Clustering algorithms","Heuristic algorithms","Optimized production technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mesh generation","optical communication","quality of service","radio links","telecommunication control","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality of service","high-connectivity topology","node distribution uniformity","cluster heads","residual energy","dynamic multipoint-to-point access","localized Delaunay triangulation","tiered mobile FSO network","dynamic management scheme","topology control","free space optical networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Free space optical communication","Network topology","Network optimization","Networks"]}],"abstract":"Due to the limited node degree and fragile links, design and management of free space optical (FSO) networks is still a great challenge.

However, identifying key intersections that will soon become congested is a difficult task, performed by tedious, thorough simulations; even more difficult is to adapt the road network so as to increase its efficiency and avoid congestion. We argue upon the social component of road traffic and propose an alternative way to detect hotspots leading to congestion by using techniques borrowed from complex network analysis. We will use the betweenness centrality and argue upon its power-law distribution, which we set out to redistribute and equalize. The paper introduces a genetic algorithm that redistributes the betweenness values at a community level in a city by changing street directions and number of available lanes in order to reduce (and possibly even eliminate) congestion hotspots. Experimental results in terms of reducing traffic loads from hotspots and transferring to neighboring streets yield an improvement with a factor of up to 90% times without adding significant costs or modifying the existing infrastructure.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07256877.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"84","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7256877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7256877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7256877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bio-inspired redistribution of urban traffic flow using a social network approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Roads","Cities and towns","Optimization","Complex networks","Algorithm design and analysis","Vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","intelligent transportation systems","network theory (graphs)","road vehicles","social networking (online)","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["urban traffic flow","bioinspired redistribution","social network","road network","road vehicle","congestion free status","key intersections identification","congestion avoidance","complex network analysis","genetic algorithm","congestion hotspots","traffic load reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["road networks","complex networks","genetic optimization","betweenness centrality","complex network analysis","intelligent transportation system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7256877/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Bio-inspired redistribution of urban traffic flow using a social network approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7256877/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15454886","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bio-inspired redistribution of urban traffic flow using a social network approach","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086625S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7256877","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7256880,"authors":[{"name":"Rohitash Chandra","affiliation":["Software-Foundation, Artificial Intelligence and Cybernetics Research Group, Nausori, Fiji","School of Computing Information and Mathematical Sciences, University of the South Pacific, Suva, Fiji"],"firstName":"Rohitash","lastName":"Chandra","id":"37085378017"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7492-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7491-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"7256880","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7256880","abstract":"Cooperative coevolution is an evolutionary computation method which solves a problem by decomposing it into smaller subcomponents.

The proposed approach is tested on time series problems in which the different time-lags represent the different objectives. Multiple pre-processed datasets distinguished by their time-lags are used for training and testing.

The advantage of cooperative coevolutionary algorithms is the decomposition of the problem which allows us to learn different parts of the problem instead of the whole problem at once. However, previous research within the field of global optimization has shown that cooperative coevolutionary algorithms are biased towards equilibrium states. Since studies concerning cooperative coevolutionary algorithms used for solving multi-objective optimization problems were initiated, no attention has been paid to this issue. In this paper, we show empirical evidence of the existence of these problems within the multi-objective optimization field and present a novel cooperative coevolution framework which, through the use of the concept of Nash equilibrium, alleviates some of those optimization-related pathologies present in cooperative coevolutionary algorithms. We compare our proposed algorithm with respect to two algorithms that make use of the cooperative coevolutionary model to multi-objective optimization, NSCCGA (that makes use of Potter's coevolutionary model) and GCEA (a game theory based coevolutionary algorithm). The computational effort required by each algorithm (measured in terms of the number of fitness function evaluations) is also analyzed. Our preliminary results indicate that the proposed framework clearly outperforms the results of the aforementioned algorithms when using the Deb-Thiele- Laumanns-Zitzler (DTLZ) and the Zitzler-Deb-Thiele (ZDT) test suites.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7256881","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07256881.pdf","startPage":"109","endPage":"116","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7256881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A non-cooperative game for faster convergence in cooperative coevolution for multi-objective optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7256881/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"A non-cooperative game for faster convergence in cooperative coevolution for multi-objective optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15454924","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7256881/","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A non-cooperative game for faster convergence in cooperative coevolution for multi-objective optimization","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083834S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7256881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7256882,"authors":[{"name":"Geng Zhang","affiliation":["University of Macau, Taipa, Macau, MO"],"firstName":"Geng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085557239"},{"name":"Yangmin Li","affiliation":["University of Macau, Taipa, Macau, MO"],"firstName":"Yangmin","lastName":"Li","id":"37279899000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7492-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7491-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"7256882","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7256882","abstract":"This paper develops a new elimination mechanism strategy to improve the performance of cooperative particle swarm optimizer with elimination mechanism (CPSO-EM) algorithm which is proposed to extract better vector elements by analyzing features of cooperative particle swarm optimizer (CPSO).

This paper hypothesises that hidden layer saturation is a significant factor contributing to the poor training performance of the particle swarms, hindering good performance on neural networks regardless of the architecture size. A selection of classification problems is used to test this hypothesis. It is discovered that although a certain degree of saturation is necessary for successful training, higher degrees of saturation ultimately lead to poor generalisation. Possible factors leading to saturation are suggested, and means of alleviating saturation in particle swarms through weight initialisation range, maximum velocity, and search space boundaries are analysed.

However, its performance deteriorates significantly in noisy environments. Some studies have addressed this issue by introducing a resampling method. Most existing methods allocate a fixed and predetermined budget of re-evaluations for every iteration, but cannot change the budget according to different environments adaptively. Our previous work proposed a PSO-LA to integrate PSO with a Learning Automaton (LA) variant. PSO-LA utilizes LA's flexible self-adaption and automatic learning capability to learn the budget allocation for each iteration. This work further improves PSO-LA by the introduction of a subset scheme based LA (subLA) into PSO to further increase the probability of correctly finding the best particle through the pursuit on the a subset of particles with better performance, yielding a new method called LAPSO. LAPSO does not record the historical global best solution but finds it from the subset learned by subLA to jump out of the trapped area that may have a false global best solution. It can also adaptively consume computing budgets for every particle per iteration and, accordingly, total iteration times. Through experiments on 20 large-scale benchmark functions subject to different levels of noise, this work convincingly shows that LAPSO outperforms the existing ones in both accuracy and convergence rate of the optimization problems in noisy environments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7256885/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15454859","htmlLink":"/document/7256885/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A learning automata-based particle swarm optimization algorithm for noisy environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A learning automata-based particle swarm optimization algorithm for noisy environment","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066813S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7256885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7256886,"authors":[{"name":"Ji Ma","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085555710"},{"name":"JunQi Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"JunQi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38010290600"},{"name":"LinWei Xu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"LinWei","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085363073"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7492-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7491-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"7256886","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Optimization","Convergence","Topology","Benchmark testing","Sociology","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interpersonal learning particle swarm optimizer","populationbased optimization technique","ILPSO"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7256886","abstract":"Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO) is a population-based optimization technique that can be applied to a wide range of problems. However, except learning from itself (pbest), the way of information exchanging between a particle and the entire swarm is only learning from the best particle (gbest) in regular PSO and the interaction is \u201cone-way\u201d, which means a particle in the swarm just assimilate the best information passively, and its pbest will never propagate to other particles if the pbest is not the gbest. As a result, some potential useful information is ignored. This paper presents a variant of PSO that we called Interpersonal Learning Particle Swarm Optimizer (ILPSO), which uses a novel learning strategy whereby a particle can learn from any other particles in the swarm interpersonally, and the interaction is bidirectional. This strategy enhances the diversity of the swarm and alleviate premature. Experiments are performed on 20 benchmark functions and show the algorithm has competitive performance to other six well-known PSOs.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7256886","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07256886.pdf","startPage":"148","endPage":"155","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7256886","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interpersonal learning Particle Swarm Optimizer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7256886/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Interpersonal learning Particle Swarm Optimizer","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15454866","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7256886/","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interpersonal learning Particle Swarm Optimizer","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093131S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7256886","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7256888,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher W Cleghorn","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Pretoria Pretoria, South Africa"],"firstName":"Christopher W","lastName":"Cleghorn","id":"37085499609"},{"name":"Andries Engelbrecht","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Pretoria Pretoria, South Africa"],"firstName":"Andries","lastName":"Engelbrecht","id":"37276400500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7492-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7491-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"7256888","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":180},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7256888","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Topology","Mathematical model","Algorithm design and analysis","Stability criteria","Particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","particle swarm optimisation","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fully informed particle swarm optimizer","convergence analysis","explicit conditions","order-2 stability","stagnation assumption","neighborhood size","FIPS algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7256888","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07256888.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","startPage":"164","endPage":"170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7256888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fully informed particle swarm optimizer: Convergence analysis","abstract":"At present, the explicit conditions necessary for order-2 stability of the fully informed particle swarm optimizer (FIPS) have not be derived.

Community detection in complex networks has attracted much attention in recent years. As an effective evolutionary computation technique, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has become a candidate for many optimization applications. However, PSO algorithm was originally designed for continuous optimization. In this paper, an improved simple discrete particle swarm optimization (ISPSO) algorithm and a discrete particle swarm optimization with redefined operator (IDPSO-RO) algorithm are proposed in the discrete context of community detection problem. Furthermore, a community correcting strategy is used to optimize the results. The performance of the two algorithms is tested on three real networks with known community structures. The experiment results show that ISPSO and IDPSO-RO algorithms using community correcting strategy can detect community structures more efficiently without prior knowledge about the size of communities and the number of communities.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7256889","startPage":"171","endPage":"178","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07256889.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7256889","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel community detection method based on discrete particle swarm optimization algorithms in complex networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Complex networks","Sociology","Statistics","Algorithm design and analysis","Optimization","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex networks","evolutionary computation","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["community detection method","complex networks","evolutionary computation technique","improved simple discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm","redefined operator algorithm","community correcting strategy","IDPSO-RO algorithm","community structures"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7256889/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"A novel community detection method based on discrete particle swarm optimization algorithms in complex networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7256889/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15454871","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel community detection method based on discrete particle swarm optimization algorithms in complex networks","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087446S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7256889","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7256890,"authors":[{"name":"Guillaume Jornod","affiliation":["Distributed Intelligent Systems and Algorithms Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"],"firstName":"Guillaume","lastName":"Jornod","id":"37085629982"},{"name":"Ezequiel Di Mario","affiliation":["Distributed Intelligent Systems and Algorithms Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"],"firstName":"Ezequiel","lastName":"Di Mario","id":"38228063500"},{"name":"I\u00f1aki Navarro","affiliation":["Distributed Intelligent Systems and Algorithms Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"],"firstName":"I\u00f1aki","lastName":"Navarro","id":"38275723700"},{"name":"Alcherio Martinoli","affiliation":["Distributed Intelligent Systems and Algorithms Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"],"firstName":"Alcherio","lastName":"Martinoli","id":"37325252600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7492-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7491-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"7256890","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":326},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","program visualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SwarmViz","open-source visualization tool","particle swarm optimization","metaheuristic","high dimensional optimization problems","swarm dynamics","optimization process","PSO parameters","robotic controller"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7256890","abstract":"Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a metaheuristic for solving high dimensional optimization problems.

In this article, we present SwarmViz, an open-source visualization tool for PSO. Through SwarmViz, users are able to set up PSO experiments on canonical benchmark functions or input data from external experiments (e.g., learning robotic controllers), and to visualize the optimization process with state-of-the-art visualization tools. SwarmViz has two main goals. First, to enable researchers to monitor the progress of their specific optimization problem and adjust the relevant PSO parameters. Second, to give a visual insight about PSO to students in the scope of teaching optimization techniques. We demonstrate the features of the software through examples on well-known numerical benchmark functions and a case study on the optimization of a robotic controller.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7256890","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07256890.pdf","startPage":"179","endPage":"186","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7256890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SwarmViz: An open-source visualization tool for Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7256890/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"SwarmViz: An open-source visualization tool for Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15440728","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7256890/","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SwarmViz: An open-source visualization tool for Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082209S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7256890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7256891,"authors":[{"name":"Derek Dibblee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Brock University, St. Catharines, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Derek","lastName":"Dibblee","id":"37085748648"},{"name":"Justin Maltese","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Brock University, St. Catharines, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Justin","lastName":"Maltese","id":"37085724252"},{"name":"Beatrice M.

In human learning principles, mentoring provides both self and social cognizance through guidance, direction and momentum for the learners. Such a mentoring concept is integrated in PSO for faster convergence where all the particles are divided into dynamically changing three groups, namely, mentors, mentees and independent learners. In a given iteration, the particles classified as the mentees are supported by the mentor particles for searching in the potential region and eventually diverting the search towards the optimum solution. All the remaining particles perform independent search by employing social-awareness of the global search direction for intelligent exploration of the solution space. The proposed MePSO algorithm has been evaluated using 15 benchmark test functions from CEC2013 and the performance has been compared with different variants of PSO algorithms reported in the literature. The comparative results and the statistical analysis clearly indicate that MePSO performs better with faster convergence characteristics.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7256892","startPage":"196","endPage":"203","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07256892.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7256892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mentoring based particle swarm optimization algorithm for faster convergence","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mentoring","Particle swarm optimization","Convergence","Algorithm design and analysis","Mathematical model","Benchmark testing","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","iterative methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","particle swarm optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mentoring based particle swarm optimization algorithm","learning process","MePSO algorithm","human learning principles","social cognizance","independent learners","independent search","social-awareness","global search direction","intelligent solution space exploration","statistical analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7256892/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Mentoring based particle swarm optimization algorithm for faster convergence","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7256892/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15455014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mentoring based particle swarm optimization algorithm for faster convergence","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"126.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064321S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7256892","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7256894,"authors":[{"name":"Nitin Saxena","affiliation":["Computer Science & Engineering Department, Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology Allahabad, Allahabad, India"],"firstName":"Nitin","lastName":"Saxena","id":"37088239493"},{"name":"Ashish Tripathi","affiliation":["Computer Science & Engineering Department, Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology Allahabad, Allahabad, India"],"firstName":"Ashish","lastName":"Tripathi","id":"38244218200"},{"name":"K.K.

When particles personal best and swarm's global best position do not improve in successive generation i.e. start stagnating DPSO provides dynamicity to particles externally in such a manner that stagnated particles move towards potentially better unexplored region to maintain diversity as this increases chance to recover from stagnation. By identifying and curing stagnated particles, it also avoids the problems of getting trapped in local optima and premature convergence.

Specifically, in TBHPSO, a Robust Tabu Local Search is applied to the top particle in the hierarchy in each PSO iteration; in addition, a heuristic \u201cgoodness\u201d function, similar to that used in Ant Colony Optimization, is used to bias the PSO velocity update equation. In previous work, TBHPSO was found to perform significantly better than Diversified-Restart Robust Tabu Search (DivTS), a state-of-the-art technique for the QAP. In this paper, we introduce three variations to TBHPSO. The first variation (RTBHPSO) aims to increase search diversity by applying Tabu Local Search to a randomly chosen particle rather than always applying it to the root of the HPSO hierarchy. The second variation (DTBHPSO) applies DivTS (instead of RTS) to the top particle in the hierarchy, while the third variation first selects a random particle and then probabilistically selects either DivTS or RTS to apply to it. The performance of our proposed variations is compared against the original TBHPSO, keeping the CPU time fixed for both methods in each comparison, using 31 problem instances from the QAPLib instance library.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7256895","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07256895.pdf","startPage":"220","endPage":"226","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7256895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved Particle Swarm Optimization/Tabu search approach to the Quadratic Assignment Problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7256895/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"An improved Particle Swarm Optimization/Tabu search approach to the Quadratic Assignment Problem","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15454900","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7256895/","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved Particle Swarm Optimization/Tabu search approach to the Quadratic Assignment Problem","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099445S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7256895","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":7256896,"authors":[{"name":"Sander van Rijn","affiliation":["LIACS, Leiden University, Leiden, CA, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Sander","lastName":"van Rijn","id":"37085699796"},{"name":"Michael Emmerich","affiliation":["DENC Netherlands B.V, Bussum, AM, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Emmerich","id":"37368146600"},{"name":"Edgar Reehuis","affiliation":["Natural Computing Group, Leiden University, Leiden, CA, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Edgar","lastName":"Reehuis","id":"37085655145"},{"name":"Thomas B\u00e4ck","affiliation":["Natural Computing Group, Leiden University, Leiden, CA, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"B\u00e4ck","id":"37344469700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7492-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7491-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"7256896","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7256896","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["containerisation","genetic algorithms","loading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["truck loading optimization","self-adaptive genetic algorithm","GA","container loading problem","mutation rate"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7256896","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07256896.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","startPage":"227","endPage":"234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7256896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing highly constrained truck loadings using a self-adaptive genetic algorithm","abstract":"Most research into the Container Loading problem has been done on theoretical problem sets and while taking one or two constraints into account.

Considering high penetration of renewable energies and deregulation of power systems, electric power flows can change suddenly and operators in control centers have to control voltage in wider power systems. Therefore, VVC is required to shorten the control interval and handle larger-scale power systems. One of the solutions for this problem is applications of parallel and distributed computing. Since electric power systems is one of the infrastructures of social community, sustainable voltage control is crucial and dependability is strongly required for VVC. This paper investigates not only fast computation by parallel computation but also dependability of parallel PSO for VVC. The results are meaningful for practical parallel computation by PSO in actual VVC operations.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7256906","startPage":"304","endPage":"310","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE

The uncertainties occurring due to thermal unit outage, load forecast error and wind forecast error are efficiently incorporated using expected energy not served (EENS) reliability index while EENS cost is used to reflect the reliability objective. A multi-objective genetic algorithm is proposed to solve the aforementioned scheduling problem. The algorithm is implemented on a 20 unit test system and the effect of wind penetration level, value of lost load and load forecast uncertainty is analyzed. It is demonstrated and validated through simulation studies that optimum system spinning reserve is the amount for which the sum of system operation cost and expected energy not served cost i.e., total cost is minimum. Amongst the trade-off optimal solutions obtained, a single optimum solution is highlighted which can be most important to system operators.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7256907","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07256907.pdf","startPage":"311","endPage":"318","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7256907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-objective genetic algorithm for unit commitment with significant wind penetration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7256907/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"A multi-objective genetic algorithm for unit commitment with significant wind penetration","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15440775","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7256907/","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-objective genetic algorithm for unit commitment with significant wind penetration","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096481S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7256907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7256939,"authors":[{"name":"Noriko Takase","affiliation":["Graduate School of System Design, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Noriko","lastName":"Takase","id":"38666431000"},{"name":"J\u00e1nos Botzheim","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Sz\u00e9chenyi Istv\u00e1n University, Gyor, Hungary","Graduate School of System Design, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"J\u00e1nos","lastName":"Botzheim","id":"37272027200"},{"name":"Naoyuki Kubota","affiliation":["Graduate School of System Design, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoyuki","lastName":"Kubota","id":"37275324300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7492-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7491-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"7256939","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Legged locomotion","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","learning systems","legged locomotion","neurocontrollers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spiking neural network","robot locomotion generation","mobile robot","legged robot","computational intelligence","motion patterns","temporal information","Hebbian learning","evolution strategy","physics engine"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolving spiking neural network for robot locomotion generation","abstract":"In this paper, we propose locomotion generation for a mobile robot. Legged robot can walk in various complex terrains such as stairs as well as in flat environment. However, setting its behaviour to adapt to various environments in advance is very difficult. The robot can mimic the movement of organisms based on computational intelligence. In this study, we apply spiking neural network, which can take into account the transition of temporal information between the neurons. More specifically, the motion patterns are generated by applying a spiking neural network trained by Hebbian learning and evolution strategy, by using data provided by the physics engine measuring the distance walked by the robot and applied the motion patterns to real robot. Simulation was conducted to confirm the proposed technique.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7256939","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7256939","startPage":"558","endPage":"565","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07256939.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7256939","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7256939/","displayDocTitle":"Evolving spiking neural network for robot locomotion generation","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15454916","publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7256939/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolving spiking neural network for robot locomotion generation","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063918S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7256939","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7256940,"authors":[{"name":"Ezequiel Di Mario","affiliation":["Ecole Poly technique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, School of Architecture Civil and Environmental Engineering"],"firstName":"Ezequiel","lastName":"Di Mario","id":"37085346870"},{"name":"I\u00f1aki Navarro","affiliation":["Ecole Poly technique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, School of Architecture Civil and Environmental Engineering"],"firstName":"I\u00f1aki","lastName":"Navarro","id":"38275723700"},{"name":"Alcherio Martinoli","affiliation":["Ecole Poly technique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, School of Architecture Civil and Environmental Engineering"],"firstName":"Alcherio","lastName":"Martinoli","id":"37325252600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7492-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7491-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"7256940","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Noise","Robot sensing systems","Nickel","Mobile robots","Collision avoidance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed control","learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile robots","multi-robot systems","particle swarm optimisation","resource allocation","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed particle swarm optimization","optimal computing budget allocation","multirobot learning","population-based metaheuristic","robot controller optimization","robotic performance evaluations","reevaluation strategies","statistical technique","distributed PSO OCBA algorithm","resource-constrained mobile robots","global information","distributed noise-resistant PSO variant","communication radius"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7256940","abstract":"Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a population-based metaheuristic that can be applied to optimize controllers for multiple robots using only local information.

Two plasma actuators (PAs) were installed on the upper and the lower side of the cylinder. Thus, the design problem is the multi-variate problem. A Kriging based genetic algorithm (GA) was employed to optimize the parameters of the operating conditions of PAs and the design knowledge discovery is also carried out for the multi-variate problem. The aerodynamic performance was evaluated in wind tunnel testing to overcome the disadvantages of time-consuming numerical simulations. This optimization methodology explores the optimum waveform of parameters for AC voltage by changing the waveform automatically. Based on these results, optimum designs and global design information were obtained while drastically reducing the number of experiments required compared to a full factorial experiment. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a scatter plot matrix (SPM) were introduced for design knowledge discovery. According to the discovered design knowledge, it was found that the modulation frequency for two PAs is an important parameter to reduce drag. In addition, the duty ratio for a PA on the model has two optimum points. Flow visualization is also carried out by particle image velocimetry (PIV). According to this result, the flow separation around the model is reduced by optimum design compared with the flow of the model without PAs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Linear programming","Genetic algorithms","Actuators","Analysis of variance","Plasmas","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerodynamics","design engineering","drag reduction","plasma devices","statistical analysis","wind tunnels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wind tunnel","multivariable aerodynamic design","drag reduction","plasma actuators","Kriging based genetic operating","analysis of variance","ANOVA","scatter plot matrix","SPM","particle image velocimetry","flow separation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7256944","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7256944","startPage":"589","endPage":"595","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07256944.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7256944","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7256944/","displayDocTitle":"Wind tunnel experiment based multi-valiable aerodynamic design for drag reduction around cylinder using plasma actuators","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15440786","htmlLink":"/document/7256944/","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wind tunnel experiment based multi-valiable aerodynamic design for drag reduction around cylinder using plasma actuators","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056537S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7256944","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7256959,"authors":[{"name":"Yutong Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of Ministry of Education, Xidian University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Yutong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085665187"},{"name":"Mingxing Zhou","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of Ministry of Education, Xidian University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Mingxing","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085665507"},{"name":"Zhongzhou Jiang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of Ministry of Education, Xidian University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Zhongzhou","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085541294"},{"name":"Jing Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of Ministry of Education, Xidian University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Liu","id":"37065640800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7492-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7491-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"7256959","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":416},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Big data","Electroencephalography","Genetic algorithms","Evolutionary computation","Time series analysis","Lattices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","genetic algorithms","independent component analysis","medical signal processing","multi-agent systems","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-agent genetic algorithm","big optimization problems","electroencephalographic signals","EEG signals","independent component analysis","ICA","BigOpt","evolutionary optimization techniques","MAGA","self-learning operators","crossover operators","mutation operators","heuristic strategy","Optimization of Big Data 2015 Competition","big data age"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-agent Genetic Algorithm","Big Data","Big Optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7256959","abstract":"With the coming of big data age, the data usually present in a huge magnitude such as TB or more. These data contain both useful and useless information. Therefore, techniques which can effectively analyze these data are in urgent demand. In practice, dealing with Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals with Independent Component Analysis (ICA) approximates to a big optimization problem because it requires real-time, or at least automatic in dealing with signals. Thus, in the Optimization of Big Data 2015 Competition, the problem abstracted from dealing with EEG signals through ICA is modeled as a big optimization problem (BigOpt). Evolutionary optimization techniques have been successfully used in solving various optimization problems, and in the age of big data, they have attracted increasing attentions. Since the multi-agent genetic algorithm (MAGA) shows a good performance in solving large-scale problems, in this paper, based on the framework of MAGA, an MAGA is proposed for solving the big optimization problem, which is labeled as MAGA-BigOpt. In MAGA-BigOpt, the competition and self-learning operators are redesigned and combined with crossover and mutation operators to simulate the cooperation, competition, and learning behaviors of agents. Especially, in the self-learning operator, agents quickly find decreasing directions to improve itself with a heuristic strategy. In the experiments, the performance of MAGA-BigOpt is validated on the given benchmark problems from the Optimization of Big Data 2015 Competition, where both the data with and without noise are used. The results show that MAGA-BigOpt outperforms the baseline algorithm provided by the competition in both cases with lower computational costs.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7256959","startPage":"703","endPage":"707","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7256959","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07256959.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-agent genetic algorithm for big optimization problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7256959/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A multi-agent genetic algorithm for big optimization problems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7256959/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15455094","publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-agent genetic algorithm for big optimization problems","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085992S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7256959","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7256960,"authors":[{"name":"Zong-Gan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zong-Gan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085733071"},{"name":"Ke-Jing Du","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Ke-Jing","lastName":"Du","id":"37085732615"},{"name":"Zhi-Hui Zhan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhi-Hui","lastName":"Zhan","id":"37392529300"},{"name":"Jun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37074824900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7492-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7491-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"7256960","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":663},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Biological cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deadline constrained cloud computing resources scheduling","cost optimization","dynamic objective genetic algorithm","execution time","execution cost","dynamic objective strategy","scheduling scales","deadline conditions","DOGA approach","commercial activities"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","resource","scheduling","genetic algorithm","dynamic objective strategy"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7256960","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07256960.pdf","startPage":"708","endPage":"714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7256960","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7256960","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deadline constrained cloud computing resources scheduling for cost optimization based on dynamic objective genetic algorithm","abstract":"Cloud computing resources scheduling is significant for executing the workflows in cloud platform because it relates to both the execution time and execution cost. In order to take both the time and cost into consideration, Rodriguez and Buyya have proposed a cost-minimization and deadline-constrained workflow scheduling model on cloud computing. Their model has great applicability but the solution of their particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach is not good enough and cannot meet a tight deadline condition. In this paper, we propose a genetic algorithm (GA) approach to solve this model. In order to tackle with the tight deadline condition, a dynamic objective strategy is further proposed to let GA focus on optimize the execution time objective to meet the deadline constraint when the feasible solution hasn't been obtained. After obtaining a feasible solution, the GA focuses on optimizing the execution cost within the deadline constraint. Therefore, the proposed dynamic objective GA (DOGA) has adaptive ability to the search environment to different objectives. We have conduct extensive experiments based on workflows with different scales and different cloud resources. Experimental results show that DOGA can find better solution with smaller cost than PSO does on different scheduling scales and different deadline conditions. DOGA approach is more applicable to be used in commercial activities.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7256960/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15454967","htmlLink":"/document/7256960/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Deadline constrained cloud computing resources scheduling for cost optimization based on dynamic objective genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deadline constrained cloud computing resources scheduling for cost optimization based on dynamic objective genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"194.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058105S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7256960","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7256961,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The huge increment of available data may limit the applicability of most of the standard techniques. This problem becomes even more difficult when the class distribution is skewed, the topic known as imbalanced big data classification. Evolutionary undersampling techniques have shown to be a very promising solution to deal with the class imbalance problem. However, their practical application is limited to problems with no more than tens of thousands of instances. In this contribution we design a parallel model to enable evolutionary undersampling methods to deal with large-scale problems. To do this, we rely on a MapReduce scheme that distributes the functioning of these kinds of algorithms in a cluster of computing elements. Moreover, we develop a windowing approach for class imbalance data in order to speed up the undersampling process without losing accuracy. In our experiments we test the capabilities of the proposed scheme with several data sets with up to 4 million instances. The results show promising scalability abilities for evolutionary undersampling within the proposed framework.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7256961/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7256961/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15454781","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Evolutionary undersampling for imbalanced big data classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolutionary undersampling for imbalanced big data classification","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067939S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7256961","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7256963,"authors":[{"name":"Iraklis Varlamis","affiliation":["Department of Informatics and Telematics, Harokopio University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Iraklis","lastName":"Varlamis","id":"37540823900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7492-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7491-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"7256963","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Accuracy","Cloning","Sociology","Statistics","Mobile handsets","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Android (operating system)","evolutionary computation","Global Positioning System","image classification","image motion analysis","image sampling","object detection","smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary data sampling algorithm","user movement classification","smart phones","people daily activity recognition","user activity information analysis","GPSTracker","Android phones","geo-location information","point of interest","POIs","unbalanced training data","user movement type detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7256963","abstract":"Smartphones are nowadays used for recognizing people's daily activities and habits, by collecting and analysing user activity information in real-time.

In 2014, a cost-minimization and deadline-constrained workflow scheduling (CMDCWS) model is firstly proposed by Rodriguez and Buyya, which is applicable for the business need of cloud computing that a workflow task should be finished by minimizing the execute cost within a deadline constraint. As scheduling cloud computing resources for workflow is an NP-hard problem, Rodriguez and Buyya proposed to use particle swarm optimization (PSO) to solve the CMDCWS problem. In traditional PSO for CMDCWS, each dimension in the particle position stands for each task and the value of the corresponding dimension stands for the index of the cloud resource that executes this task. However, this may have drawback because the value of each dimension does not relate to the resource characteristic but is only a meaningless index number. Therefore the learning behaviors among the particles do not make sense because learning from index number may not lead to better position. In this paper, we present a resource renumber strategy to encode the particle position and design a renumber PSO (RNPSO) for CMDCWS. In RNPSO, all the resources are re-ordered and re-numbered according to their computational ability, i.e., the cost per unit time. By this, the values of particle position can make sense and the positions difference between the well-performed and poorly-performed particles can guide poorly-performed particle to promising region. We conduct experiments on test cases with small, middle, and large scales to compare the performance of PSO and RNPSO. The results show that the resource renumber strategy is promising for enhancing the PSO performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7256982/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15454955","htmlLink":"/document/7256982/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Renumber strategy enhanced particle swarm optimization for cloud computing resource scheduling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Renumber strategy enhanced particle swarm optimization for cloud computing resource scheduling","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059111S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7256982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7256985,"authors":[{"name":"Md Asafuddoula","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Information Technology, University of New South Wales, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Md","lastName":"Asafuddoula","id":"37706124600"},{"name":"Tapabrata Ray","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Information Technology, University of New South Wales, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Tapabrata","lastName":"Ray","id":"37276115400"},{"name":"Amitay Isaacs","affiliation":["IBM Australia OzLabs, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Amitay","lastName":"Isaacs","id":"37700774300"},{"name":"Hemant Kumar Singh","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Information Technology, University of New South Wales, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Hemant Kumar","lastName":"Singh","id":"37697638400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7492-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7491-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"7256985","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sociology","Statistics","Optimization","Welding","Genetic algorithms","Steady-state","Shafts"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","quantum computing","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["steady state quantum genetic algorithm","multi/many-objective engineering optimization problems","systematic sampling","reference directions","Q-bits","quantum representation","quantum computing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7256985","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a novel decomposition based steady state quantum genetic algorithm for the solution of engineering optimization problems. Systematic sampling is used to generate reference directions and a small population of quantum individuals (solutions with variables represented as Q-bits) is evolved using a simple variation operator.

The underlying motivation of quantum representation stems from its ability to represent multiple states which offers the potential to evolve a small population of solutions. This aspect is magnified even further when one attempts to solve a many objective optimization problem where evolution of a large population of solutions may not be practically viable.

Conventional electrical power systems do not consider reverse power flow, in which the power flows toward the power system in distribution systems. When large quantities of distributed generators (DGs) are introduced into a distribution system they can cause voltage deviations beyond the statutory range, and can reverse flow toward the substation transformer. Consequently, this cause faults in electricity devices and even lead to a massive blackout. This is an important issue within the distribution system. To resolve voltage deviation problems it is necessary to consider some trade-offs. However, there is not much research adapting multi-objective optimization for use in the distribution system. Therefore this paper provides a method of multi-objective optimization in order to minimize voltage deviation while simultaneously minimizing the number of introduced voltage control devices and finding an optimum placement of those voltage control devices.

In order to utilize the solutions, a final decision making process is indispensable in most cases in which a small number of solutions have to be selected. In this process a decision maker selects the solutions according to his or her preferences or based on the knowledge acquired by observing the approximated Pareto front. Due to the limited number of solutions an algorithm can obtain, in particular when the number of objectives is large, a decision maker may be interested in sampling additional solutions in some preferred regions. This paper proposes to use a reference vector based preference articulation (RVPA) method to obtain such additional solutions in preferred regions. After describing the proposed method in detail, experiments are conducted on six benchmark MOPs to assess the performance of the proposed RVPA method. Our empirical results show that, by setting reference vectors in the objective space, the proposed RVPA is able to obtain corresponding solutions in the preferred regions at a much lower cost compared to e.g. a re-start strategy. In addition, by setting the reference vectors in a uniform way, the proposed RVPA method is also able to improve the general quality (convergence and distribution) of the solutions obtained by an MOEA.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7256991/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15454993","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"Reference vector based a posteriori preference articulation for evolutionary multiobjective optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reference vector based a posteriori preference articulation for evolutionary multiobjective optimization","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043664S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"9","articleId":"7256991","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7256993,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Desjardins","affiliation":["The School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Desjardins","id":"37085724133"},{"name":"Rafael Falcon","affiliation":["The Research & Engineering Division, Larus Technologies Corporation, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Rafael","lastName":"Falcon","id":"37594950200"},{"name":"Rami Abielmona","affiliation":["The Research & Engineering Division, Larus Technologies Corporation, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Rami","lastName":"Abielmona","id":"37273203600"},{"name":"Emil Petriu","affiliation":["The School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Emil","lastName":"Petriu","id":"37273946400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7492-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7491-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"7256993","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7256993","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Trajectory","Wireless sensor networks","Batteries","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","mobile robots","trajectory control","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective optimization approach","reliable robot-assisted sensor relocation","mobile robots","value-added services","wireless sensor networks","operational lifetime","total distance minimization","MOO formulation","RRASR","trajectory length","passive sensor","damaged sensor","evolutionary MOO algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["evolutionary multi-objective optimization","genetic algorithms","wireless sensor and robot networks","robotics","wireless sensor networks","sensor relocation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7256993","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07256993.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","startPage":"956","endPage":"964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7256993","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-objective optimization approach to reliable Robot-Assisted Sensor Relocation","abstract":"Mobile robots can provide a wide range of value-added services to wireless sensor networks during their operational lifetime. One of them has to do with the replacement of damaged sensors with other functional, passive ones. This scenario has been recently studied as the \u201cRobot-Assisted Sensor Relocation\u201d (RASR) problem. RASR solutions traditionally focus only on one aspect of the problem: minimizing the total distance traveled by the robot.The existing centralized solutions do not take into account the reliability of the passive nodes that are selected as substitutes for the damaged nodes, for instance, their current battery level. With this in mind, we propose a multi-objective optimization (MOO) formulation of the problem, named Reliable Robot-Assisted Sensor Relocation (RRASR), where we consider two more objectives in addition to the trajectory length. These objectives result from the fact that a given passive sensor selected to replace a damaged sensor in the region may not be in perfect condition and that another passive sensor may be a better option. Due to the nature of MOO problems, we must present a diverse set of solutions that exhibit a trade-off among the different decision objectives to a network manager so they may take appropriate action. We evaluate the performance of four state-of-the-art evolutionary MOO algorithms with sensor networks of varying sizes and inflicted damage levels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time RASR is approached from an MOO angle.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7256993/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15454782","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7256993/","publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A multi-objective optimization approach to reliable Robot-Assisted Sensor Relocation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-objective optimization approach to reliable Robot-Assisted Sensor Relocation","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070912S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7256993","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7256998,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Hadded","affiliation":["RAMSIS Team, CRISTAL Laboratory, Manouba, Tunisia","TELECOM SudParis, UMR 5157, France"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Hadded","id":"37085516502"},{"name":"Rachid Zagrouba","affiliation":["RAMSIS Team, CRISTAL Laboratory, Manouba, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Rachid","lastName":"Zagrouba","id":"37089136151"},{"name":"Anis Laouiti","affiliation":["TELECOM SudParis, UMR 5157, France"],"firstName":"Anis","lastName":"Laouiti","id":"37392157100"},{"name":"Paul Muhlethaler","affiliation":["INRIA, France"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Muhlethaler","id":"37296445000"},{"name":"Leila Azouz Saidane","affiliation":["RAMSIS Team, CRISTAL Laboratory, Manouba, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Leila Azouz","lastName":"Saidane","id":"37297089000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7492-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7491-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"7256998","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":645},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7256998","abstract":"Vehicular Ad hoc NETworks (VANETs) are a major component recently used in the development of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs). VANETs have a highly dynamic and portioned network topology due to the constant and rapid movement of vehicles. Currently, clustering algorithms are widely used as the control schemes to make VANET topology less dynamic for Medium Access Control (MAC), routing and security protocols. An efficient clustering algorithm must take into account all the necessary information related to node mobility. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Weighted Clustering Protocol (AWCP), specially designed for vehicular networks, which takes the highway ID, direction of vehicles, position, speed and the number of neighboring vehicles into account in order to enhance the stability of the network topology. However, the multiple control parameters of our AWCP, make parameter tuning a nontrivial problem. In order to optimize the protocol, we define a multi-objective problem whose inputs are the AWCP's parameters and whose objectives are: providing stable cluster structures, maximizing data delivery rate, and reducing the clustering overhead. We address this multi-objective problem with the Non-dominated Sorted Genetic Algorithm version 2 (NSGA-II). We evaluate and compare its performance with other multi-objective optimization techniques: Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) and Multi-objective Differential Evolution (MODE). The experiments reveal that NSGA-II improves the results of MOPSO and MODE in terms of spacing, spread, ratio of non-dominated solutions, and inverse generational distance, which are the performance metrics used for comparison.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7256998","startPage":"994","endPage":"1002","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation

The results of seven variants of particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms on IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) 2015 single objective multi-niche optimization problems are reported in this paper. The PSO algorithms include PSO with star structure, PSO with ring structure, PSO with four clusters structure, PSO with Von Neumann structure, social-only PSO with star structure, social-only PSO with ring structure, and cognition-only PSO. The experimental tests are conducted on fifteen benchmark functions. Based on the experimental results, the conclusions could be made that the PSO with ring structure performs better than the other PSO variants on multimodal optimization. To obtain good performance on the multimodal optimization problems, an algorithm needs to converge the candidate solutions to the global optima while keep the population diversity during whole search process.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7257009/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15454904","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7257009/","publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multimodal optimization using particle swarm optimization algorithms: CEC 2015 competition on single objective multi-niche optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multimodal optimization using particle swarm optimization algorithms: CEC 2015 competition on single objective multi-niche optimization","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"243.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.163132S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7257009","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7257017,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Chen","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085672031"},{"name":"Bing Xue","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Xue","id":"37660818400"},{"name":"Mengjie Zhang","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Mengjie","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37406631900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7492-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7491-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"7257017","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":299},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Mathematical model","Benchmark testing","Standards","Training data","Sociology","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","gradient methods","regression analysis","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalisation","domain adaptation","genetic programming","symbolic regression problems","complementary search","genetic beam search","symbolic regression performance","GP approaches with gradient descent","GPGD","benchmark function approximations","program trees","standard GP method"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7257017","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7257017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7257017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07257017.pdf","startPage":"1137","endPage":"1144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalisation and domain adaptation in GP with gradient descent for symbolic regression","abstract":"Genetic programming (GP) has been widely applied to symbolic regression problems and achieved good success. Gradient descent has also been used in GP as a complementary search to the genetic beam search to further improve symbolic regression performance. However, most existing GP approaches with gradient descent (GPGD) to symbolic regression have only been tested on the \u201cconventional\u201d symbolic regression problems such as benchmark function approximations and engineering practical problems with a single (training) data set only and the effectiveness on unseen data sets in the same domain and in different domains has not been fully investigated. This paper designs a series of experiment objectives to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of GPGD with various settings for a set of symbolic regression problems applied to unseen data in the same domain and adapted to other domains. The results suggest that the existing GPGD method applying gradient descent to all evolved program trees three times at every generation can perform very well on the training set itself, but cannot generalise well on the unseen data set in the same domain and cannot be adapted to unseen data in an extended domain. Applying gradient descent to the best program in the final generation of GP can also improve the performance over the standard GP method and can generalise well on unseen data for some of the tasks in the same domain, but perform poorly on the unseen data in an extended domain. Applying gradient descent to the top 20% programs in the population can generalise reasonably well on the unseen data in not only the same domain but also in an extended domain.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7257017/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15454775","htmlLink":"/document/7257017/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Generalisation and domain adaptation in GP with gradient descent for symbolic regression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalisation and domain adaptation in GP with gradient descent for symbolic regression","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"251.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.186395S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7257017","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7257023,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Wang","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems Research Group, University of York, Heslington, UK"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085419385"},{"name":"James Alfred Walker","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems Research Group, University of York, Heslington, UK"],"firstName":"James Alfred","lastName":"Walker","id":"37274812100"},{"name":"Simon J.

As the circuit clustering result is subsequently used by the circuit place-and-route process at the post-synthesis stage, the clustering quality significantly affects the routing cost and the utilisation of FPGA. Among clustering metrics, reducing the global interconnects (global nets) between configurable logic blocks (CLBs) can be viewed as the most efficient precondition to improve the clustering quality. Since the circuit has many connection properties, it is difficult to identify the proper component combinations for sub-circuits that optimise interconnect, and it is even more complicated when CLBs pose constraints. In our technique, we break the circuit clustering task into two phases. We firstly apply the MOGA to identify the best component combinations to FPGA CLBs while respecting constraints, and a second MOGA takes clustering results from the first phase and performs further optimisation. Our proposed method is tested using the MCNC-20 benchmark. The results show that the proposed technique produces better results than state-of-art algorithms in reducing global nets.

This paper proposes a multi-vector representation in GAs and PSO, which can generate multiple sets of data cases in a single run, to generate test data for complex test programs. Experiments have been conducted to examine and compare the performance of GAs and PSO on six commonly used benchmark test programs and three newly developed programs with a relatively large number of complex conditions. The experimental results show that the proposed multi-vector representation can improve the performance of GAs and PSO on all the nine tested programs, achieving the optimal 100% code coverage on the relatively easy programs. PSO outperforms GAs in terms of both the code coverage and the computational efficiency, especially on the hard programs.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7257026","startPage":"1204","endPage":"1211","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7257026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07257026.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code coverage optimisation in genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimisation for automatic software test data generation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7257026/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Code coverage optimisation in genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimisation for automatic software test data generation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7257026/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15454935","publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code coverage optimisation in genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimisation for automatic software test data generation","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"260.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111271S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7257026","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7257051,"authors":[{"name":"Li Kuang","affiliation":["Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, CN"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Kuang","id":"37085500626"},{"name":"Feng Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Software Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, P.R.

For real world large scale optimization problems with large variable/search space, using a large population of individuals in proportion to the size of search space is ubiquitous. Solving such problems with current state of the art algorithms like NSGA-II [1] is pervasive. The strength of NSGA-II lies in its non-dominance selection procedure and non-dominance based sorting of a population of individuals. Although, the non-dominated sort is computationally efficient for a small population (10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n - 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n) of solutions but becomes computationally expensive and slow for a large population (10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sup>\n - 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">5</sup>\n) of solutions. Also, various archive based algorithms [2], [3] have been proposed in past which make use of a large population apart from the principal population. Therefore, there is a huge need for a scalable and parallel implementation of NSGA-II. With advent of consumer level Graphics processing units(GPUs) and advancement of CUDA framework we try to fill this research gap using GPGPU architecture. In this paper we propose a parallel GPU based implementation of NSGA-II with major focus on non-dominated sorting. The proposed approach can be easily coupled with the original form of NSGA-II to solve real world problems using large populations.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7257074","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07257074.pdf","startPage":"1567","endPage":"1574","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7257074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A scalable parallel implementation of evolutionary algorithms for multi-objective optimization on GPUs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7257074/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"A scalable parallel implementation of evolutionary algorithms for multi-objective optimization on GPUs","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15454854","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7257074/","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A scalable parallel implementation of evolutionary algorithms for multi-objective optimization on GPUs","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082728S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7257074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7257075,"authors":[{"name":"Masataka Mizukoshi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masataka","lastName":"Mizukoshi","id":"37085705707"},{"name":"Masaharu Munetomo","affiliation":["Information Initiative Center, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaharu","lastName":"Munetomo","id":"37330250200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7492-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7491-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"7257075","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":370},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7257075","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer crime","Sparks","Genetic algorithms","IP networks","Distributed processing","Genetics","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","data handling","genetic algorithms","parallel processing","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed denial-of-service attack protection system","genetic algorithms","Hadoop cluster computing framework","Internet security","spoofing packets","traffic pattern analysis","DDoS attack prevention","Hadoop distributed processing infrastructure","scalable DDoS protection system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DDoS attack","Hadoop","Genetic Algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7257075","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07257075.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","startPage":"1575","endPage":"1580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7257075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed denial of services attack protection system with genetic algorithms on Hadoop cluster computing framework","abstract":"DDoS attacks become serious as one of the menaces of the Internet security. It is difficult to prevent because DDoS attacker send spoofing packets to victim which makes the identification of the origin of attacks very difficult. A series of techniques have been studied such as pattern matching by learning the attack pattern and abnormal traffic detection. However, pattern matching approach is not reliable because attackers always set attacks of different traffic patterns and pattern matching approach only learns from the past DDoS data. Therefore, a reliable system has to watch what kind of attacks are carried out now and investigate how to prevent those attacks. Moreover, the amount of traffic flowing through the Internet increase rapidly and thus packet analysis should be done within considerable amount of time. This paper proposes a scalable, real-time traffic pattern analysis based on genetic algorithm to detect and prevent DDoS attacks on Hadoop distributed processing infrastructure. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our scalable DDoS protection system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7257075/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15454899","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7257075/","publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Distributed denial of services attack protection system with genetic algorithms on Hadoop cluster computing framework","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed denial of services attack protection system with genetic algorithms on Hadoop cluster computing framework","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"309.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053194S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7257075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7257076,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad A.

Controllability of the complex networks can be accomplished through minimizing two quantities related to the eigenvalues of the extended adjacency matrix. The identification problem of the driver nodes can be solved as a Constrained Optimization Problem which unifies these two quantities into one framework. The cat cortical network is taken as an example of a directed weighted complex network. In this paper, the Constrained Dynamic Differential Evolution (CDDE) algorithm is generalized to produce the Generalized Constrained Dynamic Differential Evolution (GCDDE) algorithm. The GCDDE uses the exploitation probability Pe to determine whether the crossover rate CR takes random large values from the range [0.5, 1] to produce different levels of exploration ability or takes random small values from the range [0, 0.5] to produce different levels of exploitation ability. Through the value of Pe, GCCDE can attain the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation with multiformity. Then, the algorithms GCDDE and CDDE are applied to determine the controlling regions of the cortical networks. The results illustrate that GCDDE outperforms four state-of-the-art Constrained Optimization Evolutionary Algorithms and also approaches of the control theory and graph theory. Using GCDDE, the identification problem of driver nodes is investigated in a macroscopic manner. It is found that the controlling regions have a high in-degree and a low out-degree. It is important to mention that when the number of driver nodes increases, the GCDDE can find feasible optimal solutions that make the cat cortical network more controllable.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7257076","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07257076.pdf","startPage":"1581","endPage":"1588","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7257076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Locating controlling regions of neural networks using constrained evolutionary computation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7257076/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Locating controlling regions of neural networks using constrained evolutionary computation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15440776","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7257076/","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Locating controlling regions of neural networks using constrained evolutionary computation","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"310.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.143593S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7257076","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7257087,"authors":[{"name":"Moriah Bostian","affiliation":["Department of Economics, Lewis & Clark College, Portland, Oregon"],"firstName":"Moriah","lastName":"Bostian","id":"37085639055"},{"name":"Gerald Whittaker","affiliation":["Productivity and Quantitative Methods, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, India"],"firstName":"Gerald","lastName":"Whittaker","id":"37085634468"},{"name":"Ankur Sinha","affiliation":["Agricultural Research Service (USDA ARS), Corvallis, Oregon"],"firstName":"Ankur","lastName":"Sinha","id":"37555963700"},{"name":"Bradley Barnhart","affiliation":["Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), Corvallis, Oregon"],"firstName":"Bradley","lastName":"Barnhart","id":"37085639328"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7492-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7491-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"7257087","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fertilizers","Optimization","Production","Approximation algorithms","Genetic algorithms","Approximation methods","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data envelopment analysis","environmental economics","evolutionary computation","fertilisers","optimisation","profitability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data envelopment analysis solution methods","bilevel multiobjective optimization","DEA solution methods","integrated solution framework","policy-oriented problem","regulator multiobjective optimization problem","upper level","profit-maximizing decisions","lower level","production technology","firm policy response","functional form","fertilizer runoff reduction","agriculture","environmental economics","approximate optimal frontier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bilevel multi-objective optimization","Data envelopment analysis","Bilevel evolutionary algorithm","Nitrogen pollution"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7257087","abstract":"This study illustrates the use of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) solution methods in bilevel optimization problems. Here, we show that DEA and bilevel optimization can also be used together as part of an integrated solution framework. We work with a policy-oriented problem in which the regulator's multi-objective optimization problem at the upper level is constrained by the profit-maximizing decisions of individual firms at the lower level. Each firm's response to the policy is a prori unknown to the regulator, and depends on the underlying production technology. Rather than assuming a common production relationship across firms, DEA allows us to model each firm's response to the policy without imposing a functional form on the production technology. We use DEA to estimate the technology facing each producer, based on observed practices of other producers. Doing so endogenizes the cost of responding to prospective policies at the lower level, providing a more realistic solution set at the upper level. Our application addresses the design of a policy to reduce fertilizer runoff from agriculture, an important problem in environmental economics. We employ a multi-objective bilevel evolutionary algorithm to solve for the approximate optimal frontier.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7257087","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07257087.pdf","startPage":"1667","endPage":"1674","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7257087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incorporating data envelopment analysis solution methods into bilevel multi-objective optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7257087/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Incorporating data envelopment analysis solution methods into bilevel multi-objective optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15454836","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7257087/","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incorporating data envelopment analysis solution methods into bilevel multi-objective optimization","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"321.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11782S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7257087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7257115,"authors":[{"name":"Kalyanmoy Deb","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Kalyanmoy","lastName":"Deb","id":"37272206800"},{"name":"Ling Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085479103"},{"name":"Sandeep Kulkarni","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Sandeep","lastName":"Kulkarni","id":"37275753100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7492-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7491-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"7257115","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":333},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7257115","abstract":"Most designs in practice go through a number of different loading or operating conditions.

Despite its practical importance, multi-scenario consideration has not been paid much attention in multi-objective optimization literature. In this paper, we address this challenging issue by suggesting an aggregate based handling of multiple scenarios and contrasts the proposed approach against a recently suggested approach which involves running multi-objective optimization multiple times and a rigid decision-making method. The proposed method is applied to two numerical test problems and two engineering design problems. This first evolutionary based multi-scenario, multi-objective optimization study should spur further interests among EMO researchers.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7257115","startPage":"1877","endPage":"1884","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07257115.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7257115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-scenario, multi-objective optimization using evolutionary algorithms: Initial results","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Aggregates","Decision making","Bridges","Loading","Linear programming","Context"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","evolutionary computation","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiscenario multiobjective optimization","evolutionary algorithms","decision-making method","numerical test problems","engineering design problems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7257115/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Multi-scenario, multi-objective optimization using evolutionary algorithms: Initial results","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7257115/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15454819","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-scenario, multi-objective optimization using evolutionary algorithms: Initial results","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"349.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053626S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7257115","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7257116,"authors":[{"name":"Ruimin Shen","affiliation":["School of Mathematics & Computational Science, Xiangtan University, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Ruimin","lastName":"Shen","id":"38251930600"},{"name":"Jinhua Zheng","affiliation":["Institute of Information Engineering, Xiangtan University, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Jinhua","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37276383900"},{"name":"Miqing Li","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems & Computing, Brunel University, Uxbridge, Middlesex, U.

Meanwhile, generic programming is widely used in OTL, and the generic algorithms can be used to process different data structures. However, compared with C++, the Python script is more suitable for building the experimental platform. To ensure that all attributes of the experimental results can be fully maintained, a database is used to store the experimental data. Moreover, batch experiments can be easily defined in a set of configuration files; thus, the experiments can be executed automatically without human intervention. In addition, serial and various parallel execution modes are supported, and the user can easily switch the running mode to distributed computing to increase the computing speed. Finally, a highly customizable data visualization tool is created to play back the data sample stored in the database. From a series of comparative studies, the accuracy and running performance of OTL are verified by the statistical results.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7257116","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07257116.pdf","startPage":"1885","endPage":"1892","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7257116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid development platform for evolutionary multi-objective optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7257116/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid development platform for evolutionary multi-objective optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15454920","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7257116/","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid development platform for evolutionary multi-objective optimization","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"350.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095109S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7257116","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7257117,"authors":[{"name":"Kalyan Shankar Bhattacharjee","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Information Technology, University of New South Wales, Australia"],"firstName":"Kalyan Shankar","lastName":"Bhattacharjee","id":"37085748052"},{"name":"Tapabrata Ray","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Information Technology, University of New South Wales, Australia"],"firstName":"Tapabrata","lastName":"Ray","id":"37276115400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7492-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7491-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"7257117","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective evaluation in multiobjective optimization: A less explored avenue","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7257117","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Support vector machines","Linear programming","Sociology","Statistics","Context","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["population based stochastic algorithms","multiobjective optimization problems","computationally expensive analysis","objective functions","computational cost","selective evaluation strategies","support vector machine classifier","SVM classifier","nondominated sorting genetic algorithm","NSGA- II","unconstrained biobjective optimization problems","DTLZ1-DTLZ5","search process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiobjective Optimization","Selective evaluation","Supervised classification learning"]}],"abstract":"Population based stochastic algorithms have long been used for the solution of multiobjective optimization problems. In the context of computationally expensive analysis, the existing practice utilizes some form of surrogates or approximations. In this paper, we investigate the effects of selective evaluation of promising solutions and try to derive answers to the following questions: (a) should we discard the solution based on variable values only ? (b) should we evaluate one of its objective functions and then decide to select or discard it ? or (c) should we evaluate both its objective functions before selecting or discarding it ? While evaluation of solutions is crucial for learning, it comes with a computational cost that can be significant for problems involving computationally expensive analysis. Herein, we study the effects of various selective evaluation strategies using support vector machine (SVM) classifier coupled with non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The performance of the strategies have been evaluated using five well studied unconstrained bi-objective optimization problems (DTLZ1-DTLZ5) with limited computational budget. The results clearly indicate the benefits of using certain strategies for certain class of problems and in certain stages of the search process. Furthermore, the results also suggest that some solutions can be discarded without any evaluation, while for others after evaluation of one or both objective(s). Selective evaluation is a rarely investigated field and we hope that this study would prompt design of efficient algorithms that selectively evaluate solutions on the fly i.e. based on the trade-off between need to learn/evaluate and cost to learn.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7257117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7257117","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07257117.pdf","startPage":"1893","endPage":"1900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7257117/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Selective evaluation in multiobjective optimization: A less explored avenue","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15455081","htmlLink":"/document/7257117/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective evaluation in multiobjective optimization: A less explored avenue","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"351.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057987S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7257117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7257119,"authors":[{"name":"Seyyedeh Newsha Ghoreishi","affiliation":["University of Southern Denmark, Center for Energy Informatics, Odense, Denmark"],"firstName":"Seyyedeh Newsha","lastName":"Ghoreishi","id":"37085641240"},{"name":"Jan Corfixen S\u00f8rensen","affiliation":["University of Southern Denmark, Center for Energy Informatics, Odense, Denmark"],"firstName":"Jan Corfixen","lastName":"S\u00f8rensen","id":"37085650428"},{"name":"Bo N\u00f8rregaard J\u00f8rgensen","affiliation":["University of Southern Denmark, Center for Energy Informatics, Odense, Denmark"],"firstName":"Bo N\u00f8rregaard","lastName":"J\u00f8rgensen","id":"37443684000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7492-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7491-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"7257119","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Meteorology","Approximation algorithms","Sensors","Approximation methods","Mathematical model","Optimization","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air pollution control","decision making","evolutionary computation","nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms","nonlinear greenhouse climate control problem","nontrivial real world decision-making processes","complex real-world problems","nonlinear multiobjective multiissue optimization problem","\u03b5-NSGAII","\u03b5-MOEA","PAES","PESAII","SPEAII","nonlinear complex climate control problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7257119","abstract":"Non-trivial real world decision-making processes usually involve multiple parties having potentially conflicting interests over a set of issues.

These kinds of problems do not have a single solution, but a set of optimal trade-off solutions. These trade-off solutions are stored in a fixed-size archive during the optimisation process. A decision maker then decides which trade-off solution to use for a specific optimisation problem. Larger archives require more computations than smaller archives. However, no research has been conducted to determine the influence of the archive size on the performance of algorithms when solving these kinds of problems. Therefore, this paper investigates the effect of archive sizes on the performance of the dynamic vector evaluated particle swarm optimisation algorithm. In addition, this study investigates the effect of the sampling size of the true Pareto-optimal front (POF) on the performance measure values when using small archives. The results indicate that the archive size does influence the performance of the algorithm and that in certain cases a small archive size may be beneficial. Furthermore, the results indicate that a larger sampling size of the true POF results in a worse performance measure value for the smaller archives.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7257121","startPage":"1926","endPage":"1933","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7257121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07257121.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of the archive size on the performance of the dynamic vector evaluated particle swarm optimisation algorithm solving dynamic multi-objective optimisation problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7257121/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Influence of the archive size on the performance of the dynamic vector evaluated particle swarm optimisation algorithm solving dynamic multi-objective optimisation problems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7257121/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15454870","publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of the archive size on the performance of the dynamic vector evaluated particle swarm optimisation algorithm solving dynamic multi-objective optimisation problems","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"355.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095675S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7257121","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7257128,"authors":[{"name":"Joon-Woo Lee","affiliation":["Dept. of Robotics and Mechatronics, Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials (KIMM), Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Joon-Woo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37406245200"},{"name":"Taeyong Choi","affiliation":["Dept. of Robotics and Mechatronics, Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials (KIMM), Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Taeyong","lastName":"Choi","id":"37277959400"},{"name":"Hyunmin Do","affiliation":["Dept. of Robotics and Mechatronics, Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials (KIMM), Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Hyunmin","lastName":"Do","id":"38236486700"},{"name":"Dongil Park","affiliation":["Dept. of Robotics and Mechatronics, Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials (KIMM), Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Dongil","lastName":"Park","id":"37672279400"},{"name":"Chanhun Park","affiliation":["Dept. of Robotics and Mechatronics, Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials (KIMM), Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Chanhun","lastName":"Park","id":"37085619298"},{"name":"Young-Su Son","affiliation":["Dept. of Robotics and Mechatronics, Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials (KIMM), Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Su","lastName":"Son","id":"37590506200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7492-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7491-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"7257128","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Particle swarm optimization","Benchmark testing","Information exchange","Standards","Bones","Gaussian distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous cooperative bare bones particle swarm optimization","Gaussian jump","large scale global optimization","LSGO","BBPSO","information exchange"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7257128","abstract":"Many optimization problems in recent engineering are complex and high-dimensional problems, a so-called Large-Scale Global Optimization (LSGO) problem, due to the increasing requirements for multidisciplinary approach. This paper proposes a novel Bare Bones Particle Swarm Optimization (BBPSO) algorithm to solve LSGO problems. The BBPSO is a variant of a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and is based on Gaussian distribution. The BBPSO does not consider the selection of controllable parameters of the PSO and is a simple but powerful optimizer. This algorithm, however, is vulnerable to LSGO problems. This study has improved its performance for LSGO problems by combining the heterogeneous cooperation based on the information exchange between particles and the Gaussian jump strategy to avoid local optima. The CEC'2015 Special Session on Large-Scale Global Optimization has given 15 benchmark problems to provide convenience and flexibility for comparing various optimization algorithms specifically designed for large-scale global optimization.

Nevertheless, employing Molecular Dynamics trajectories in virtual screening of large repositories is a very costly procedure, which ultimately may become unfeasible. Data clustering have been applied in this context with the goal of reducing the overall computational cost in order to make this task feasible. In this paper, we develop a novel estimation of distribution algorithm called Clus-EDA for clustering entire trajectories using structural features from the substrate-binding cavity of the protein receptor. This novel approach is capable of reducing the original trajectory to about 4% of its original size whilst keeping all relevant information for the analysis of receptor-ligand binding. The resulting partition generated by the estimation of distribution algorithm is further validated by analyzing the interactions between 20 ligands and a Fully-Flexible Receptor model containing a 20 ns Molecular Dynamics simulation trajectory. Results show that Clus-EDA is capable of outperforming traditional clustering algorithms such as k-means and hierarchical clustering by providing the smallest variance of the free energy of binding within the conformations in each cluster.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7257138","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07257138.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7257138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","startPage":"2058","endPage":"2065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clustering Molecular Dynamics trajectories with a univariate estimation of distribution algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7257138","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Clustering Molecular Dynamics trajectories with a univariate estimation of distribution algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7257138/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15440727","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7257138/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clustering Molecular Dynamics trajectories with a univariate estimation of distribution algorithm","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"372.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096728S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7257138","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7257156,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Piskur","affiliation":["Center for Computer Games Research, IT University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Piskur","id":"37085610071"},{"name":"Peter Greve","affiliation":["Center for Computer Games Research, IT University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Greve","id":"37085614727"},{"name":"Julian Togelius","affiliation":["New York University, Metrotech Center, Brooklyn, New York"],"firstName":"Julian","lastName":"Togelius","id":"38483272100"},{"name":"Sebastian Risi","affiliation":["Center for Computer Games Research, IT University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Risi","id":"38230648800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7492-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7491-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"7257156","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Biological neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Neurons","Sensors","Navigation","Collaboration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human factors","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BrainCrafter","human-based neural network engineering","artificial neural networks","ANN","human design capabilities","machine design capabilities","complex artificial brains"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7257156","abstract":"This paper presents the online application Brain-Crafter, in which users can manually build artificial neural networks (ANNs) to control a robot in a maze environment.

Introduction of brain information to Interactive Genetic Algorithm (IGA) was considered, because this biological information is strongly related to Kansei. Two experiments were performed to examine the proposed framework. Five females participated in the experiments. First, we measured participants' brain activities using an evaluation system that simulated product presentation and examined whether the estimator built from these data could estimate the precise preference levels. The stimuli were dress designs with various colors and shapes. The subjects' brain activities and button responses were obtained in two sessions. The estimator that outputs a preference level on the basis of brain activity patterns was built from the result of the first session. By applying the estimator to the former and the later brain information and by comparing the results and button responses, it was demonstrated that multilevel preference could be estimated. In the second experiment, the dress selection simulation using an IGA was performed. The IGA used the evaluation values which were obtained from the estimator constructed from the first session. They increased by generation achieved statistical significance. I was determined that preference levels could be estimated adequately using brain activities when similar stimuli were presented, e.g. a recommendation system for dress selection.

In this paper, a multi-objective artificial bee colony (MOABC) framework is developed for feature selection in classification, and a new fuzzy mutual information based criterion is proposed to evaluate the relevance of feature subsets. Three new multi-objective feature selection approaches are proposed by integrating MOABC with three filter fitness evaluation criteria, which are mutual information, fuzzy mutual information and the proposed fuzzy mutual information. The proposed multi-objective feature selection approaches are examined by comparing them with three single-objective ABC-based feature selection approaches on six commonly used datasets. The results show that the proposed approaches are able to achieve better performance than the original feature set in terms of the classification accuracy and the number of features. By using the same evaluation criterion, the proposed multi-objective algorithms generally perform better than the single-objective methods, especially in terms of reducing the number of features. Furthermore, the proposed fuzzy mutual information criterion outperforms mutual information and the original fuzzy mutual information in both single-objective and multi-objective manners. This work is the first study on multi-objective ABC for filter feature selection in classification, which shows that multi-objective ABC can be effectively used to address feature selection problems.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7257185","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07257185.pdf","startPage":"2420","endPage":"2427","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7257185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-objective artificial bee colony approach to feature selection using fuzzy mutual information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7257185","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7257185/","displayDocTitle":"A multi-objective artificial bee colony approach to feature selection using fuzzy mutual information","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15440769","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7257185/","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-objective artificial bee colony approach to feature selection using fuzzy mutual information","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"419.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070173S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7257185","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7257186,"authors":[{"name":"Tony Butler-Yeoman","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Tony","lastName":"Butler-Yeoman","id":"37085609360"},{"name":"Bing Xue","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Xue","id":"37660818400"},{"name":"Mengjie Zhang","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Mengjie","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37406631900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7492-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7491-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"7257186","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":333},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7257186","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","Filtering algorithms","Mathematical model","Algorithm design and analysis","Computational efficiency","Training","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","feature selection","filtering theory","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","hybrid filter-wrapper approach","learning algorithm","classification algorithm","feature selection algorithms","FastPSO","RapidPSO","WrapperPSO","FilterPSO","pure wrapper algorithm","computational cost","computational time"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7257186","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07257186.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","startPage":"2428","endPage":"2435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7257186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle swarm optimisation for feature selection: A hybrid filter-wrapper approach","abstract":"Feature selection is an important pre-processing step, which can reduce the dimensionality of a dataset and increase the accuracy and efficiency of a learning/classification algorithm. However, existing feature selection algorithms mainly wrappers and filters have their own advantages and disadvantages. This paper proposes two filter-wrapper hybrid feature selection algorithms based on particle swarm optimisation (PSO), where the first algorithm named FastPSO combined filter and wrapper into the search process of PSO for feature selection with most of the evaluations as filters and a small number of evaluations as wrappers. The second algorithm named RapidPSO further reduced the number of wrapper evaluations. Theoretical analysis on FastPSO and RapidPSO is conducted to investigate their complexity. FastPSO and RapidPSO are compared with a pure wrapper algorithm named WrapperPSO and a pure filter algorithm named FilterPSO on nine benchmark datasets of varying difficulty. The experimental results show that both FastPSO and RapidPSO can successfully reduce the number of features and simultaneously increase the classification performance over using all features. The two proposed algorithms maintain the high classification performance achieved by WrapperPSO and significantly reduce the computational time, although the number of features is larger. At the same time, they increase the classification accuracy of FilterPSO and reduce the number of features, but increased the computational cost. FastPSO outperformed RapidPSO in terms of the classification accuracy and the number of features, but increased the computational time, which shows the trade-off between the efficiency and effectiveness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7257186/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15454874","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7257186/","publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Particle swarm optimisation for feature selection: A hybrid filter-wrapper approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle swarm optimisation for feature selection: A hybrid filter-wrapper approach","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"420.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101503S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7257186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-25"},{"_id":7257188,"authors":[{"name":"Jonatas L. de Paiva","affiliation":["Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Carlos, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Jonatas L.","lastName":"de Paiva","id":"37085668919"},{"name":"Claudio F.

It is arguable that the selection in evolutionary algorithms is a classification problem in nature, i.e., selection equals to classifying the selected solutions into one class and the unselected ones into another class. Following this idea, we propose a classification based preselection for multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. This approach maintains two external populations: one is a positive data set which contains a set of `good' solutions, and the other is a negative data set contains a set of `bad' solutions. In each generation, the two external populations are used to train a classifier firstly, then the classifier is applied to filter the newly generated candidate solutions and only the ones labeled as positive are kept as the offspring solutions.

However, distributing the tasks into different processors (or cores) is a good solution in speeding up the process overall. In this study, a novel and pragmatic distributed computing approach for multiobjective evolutionary optimization algorithm is proposed. Instead of dividing the objective space into pre-defined cone-domination principles, as proposed in an earlier study, a distribution of reference points initialized on a hyper-plane spanning the entire objective space is assigned to different processors and the R-NSGA-II procedure is invoked to find respective partial efficient fronts. Our results show that the proposed distributed computing approach reduces the overall computational effort compared to that needed with a single-processor method.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7257250","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07257250.pdf","startPage":"2907","endPage":"2914","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7257250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reference point based distributed computing for multiobjective optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7257250","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7257250/","displayDocTitle":"Reference point based distributed computing for multiobjective optimization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15455041","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7257250/","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reference point based distributed computing for multiobjective optimization","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"484.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094898S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7257250","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7257252,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Li","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Shijiazhuang University of Economics, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, P.R.China","School of Computer Science, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, Hubei, P.R.

This work tries to further improve the effectiveness of the directed mating by focusing on the search directions in the objective space. Since the conventional directed mating picks useful infeasible solutions based on Pareto dominance, all solutions are given the same search direction regardless of their locations in the objective space. To improve the diversity of the obtained solutions in evolutionary constrained multi-objective optimization, we propose a variant of the directed mating using the inverted PBI (IPBI) scalarizing function. The proposed IPBI-based directed mating gives unique search directions to all solutions depending on their locations in the objective space. Also, the proposed IPBI-based directed mating can control the strength of directionality for each solution's search direction by the parameter \u03b8. We use discrete m-objective k-knapsack problems and continuous mCDTLZ problems with 2-4 objectives and compare the search performances of TNSDM algorithm using the conventional directed mating and the proposed TNSDM-IPBI using IPBI-based directed mating. The experimental results shows that the proposed TNSDM-IPBI using the appropriate \u03b8* achieves higher search performance than the conventional TNSDM in all test problems used in this work by improving the diversity of solutions in the objective space.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7257253","startPage":"2929","endPage":"2936","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07257253.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7257253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Directed mating using inverted PBI function for constrained multi-objective optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","knapsack problems","Pareto optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary constrained multiobjective optimization","objective function values","search performance","search directions","Pareto dominance","IPBI-based directed mating","inverted PBI scalarizing function","discrete m-objective k-knapsack problems","continuous mCDTLZ problems","TNSDM algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7257253/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Directed mating using inverted PBI function for constrained multi-objective optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7257253/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15440729","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Directed mating using inverted PBI function for constrained multi-objective optimization","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"487.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080102S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7257253","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7257268,"authors":[{"name":"Simone A.

A composite SaaS constitutes a group of loosely-coupled applications that communicate with each other to form higher-level functionality. The benefits to the SaaS providers are reduced delivery cost and flexible SaaS functions, and the benefit for the users is the decreased cost of subscription. For this to be achieved effectively, the optimization of the process is required in order to manage the SaaS resources in the data center efficiently. In this paper, the optimization task of composite SaaS is investigated using an Immune network optimization approach. The approach makes use of activation and suppression that are mimicked by the natural immune system triggering an immune response not only when antibodies interact with antigens but also when they interact with other antibodies. Experiments are conducted with a series of SaaS configurations and the proposed immune network algorithm is compared with a formerly proposed grouping genetic algorithm. The results show that the immune network algorithm outperforms the grouping genetic algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Immune network algorithm applied to the optimization of composite SaaS in cloud computing","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7257268","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07257268.pdf","startPage":"3042","endPage":"3048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7257268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7257268","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7257268/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Immune network algorithm applied to the optimization of composite SaaS in cloud computing","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7257268/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15440738","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Immune network algorithm applied to the optimization of composite SaaS in cloud computing","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"502.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119119S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7257268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7257269,"authors":[{"name":"Ronghua Shang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of Ministry of Education, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Ronghua","lastName":"Shang","id":"37676117800"},{"name":"Licheng Jiao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of Ministry of Education, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Licheng","lastName":"Jiao","id":"37276095000"},{"name":"Hao Xu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of Ministry of Education, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085621367"},{"name":"Yangyang Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of Ministry of Education, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yangyang","lastName":"Li","id":"37422525700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7492-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7491-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"7257269","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7257269","abstract":"This paper proposes a quantum immune clone algorithm to solve the constrained multi-objective optimization problem.

The appearing of the non-feasible solutions expands the search scope and makes it easy to evolve solutions near the Pareto front.

Many researchers have been focusing on this topic due to the potential of yielding significant profits on the invested money in a short time frame. Believing in the predictability of stock markets, traders have been using Technical Analysis tools for a very long time to analyze and predict the behavior of stocks, aiming to make the best investment decisions possible with this information. In addition, applying machine learning techniques to predict stock market movements has become an area of research that has received a lot of attention in recent years. Popular algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines have been widely used in this area and they have been reporting satisfactory performances. As an attempt to improve the accuracy of these algorithms, researchers have been proposing techniques to combine them, forming Ensemble Systems. This work presents the design of an Ensemble System based on Genetic Algorithm for forecasting the weekly prices' trend in the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange Index (Ibovespa Index). In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, experiments were conducted to compare it with other popular ensemble methods (e.g., Bagging, Boosting and Random Forests). Finally, the empirical results show that the proposed model outperforms the other ensemble methods. Therefore, this implies that the proposed approach can be used by traders as a promising tool for forecasting stock market prices.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7257276/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15440716","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7257276/","publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Ensemble system based on genetic algorithm for stock market forecasting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ensemble system based on genetic algorithm for stock market forecasting","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"510.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.12079S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7257276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7257277,"authors":[{"name":"Siming Liu","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno, Reno, NV"],"firstName":"Siming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37071149200"},{"name":"Shamik Sengupta","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno, Reno, NV"],"firstName":"Shamik","lastName":"Sengupta","id":"37288180900"},{"name":"Sushil J.

Security problems in cognitive radio networks have been heavily studied in recent years. However, few studies have considered the effect of memory size on attack and defense strategies. We model cognitive radio network attack and defense as a zero-sum stochastic game. Our research focuses on using GAs to recognize attack patterns from different attackers and evolving defensive strategies against the attack patterns so as to maximize network utility. We assume attackers are not only able to attack high utility channels, but are also capable of attacking based on the history of high utility channel usage by the secondary user. In our simulations, different memory lengths are used by the secondary user against memory enabled attackers. Results show that the best performance strategies evolved by GAs gain more payoff, on average, than the Nash equilibrium. Against our baseline memory enabled attackers, GAs quickly and reliably found the theoretically globally optimal defensive strategy. These results indicate that GAs is a viable approach for generating strong defenses against arbitrary memory based attackers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7257277/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15454805","publicationDate":"May 2015","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7257277/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Evolving defensive strategies against iterated induction attacks in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolving defensive strategies against iterated induction attacks in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"511.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061489S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7257277","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7257282,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Li","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Li","id":"37085735310"},{"name":"Jianchang Liu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Jianchang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37537662300"},{"name":"Shubin Tan","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Shubin","lastName":"Tan","id":"37538334500"},{"name":"Xia Yu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Xia","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085403188"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7492-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7491-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"7257282","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":367},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lead","Sorting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decomposition","evolutionary computation","learning (artificial intelligence)","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["general multiobjective particle swarm optimizer","R2-indicator","decomposition method","R2-MOPSO","personal best leaders","elitist-learning strategy","Gaussian learning strategy","evolutionary algorithms","many-objective optimization problems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7257282","abstract":"This paper proposes a general multi-objective particle swarm optimizer based on R2-indicator and decomposition (called R2-MOPSO) to deal with multi-objective optimization problems and then to solve many-objective optimization problems.

In PSO, three parameters should be given experimentally or empirically. While in the sDMS-PSO a self-adaptive strategy of parameters is embedded. One or more parameters are assigned to different swarms adaptively. In a single swarm, through specified iterations, the parameters achieving the maximum number of renewal of the local best solutions are recorded. Then the information of competitive arguments is shared among all of the swarms through generating new parameters using the saved part. Multiple swarms detect the arguments in various groups in parallel during the evolutionary process which accelerates the learning speed. What's more, sharing the information of the best parameters leads to faster convergence. A local search method of the quasi-Newton is included to enhance the ability of exploitation. The sDMS-PSO is tested on the set of benchmark functions provided by CEC2015. The results of the experiment are showed in the paper.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7257290","startPage":"3206","endPage":"3213","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7257290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07257290.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A self-adaptive dynamic particle swarm optimizer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7257290/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A self-adaptive dynamic particle swarm optimizer","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7257290/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15454985","publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A self-adaptive dynamic particle swarm optimizer","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"524.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11666S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7257290","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":7257302,"authors":[{"name":"Matheus R.

The proposed PSO algorithm accomplishes the task of forming groups based on two criteria, level of knowledge and interest, thus forming groups with different levels and similar interests, providing better students' interactions and knowledge construction. Results of computational tests showed that the algorithm can meet the criteria for grouping in a satisfactory computation time and it is more efficient than algortithms for group formation commonly approached in the literature.

In this paper, three different classification algorithms will be compared for the purposes of maximizing capital while minimizing risk to the investor. The main contribution of this work is a demonstrated improvement over other prediction methods using machine learning; the results show that tuning support vector machine parameters with particle swarm optimization leads to highly accurate (approximately 95%) and robust stock forecasting for historical datasets.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7257306","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07257306.pdf","startPage":"3327","endPage":"3331","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7257306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust stock value prediction using support vector machines with particle swarm optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7257306/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Robust stock value prediction using support vector machines with particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15454842","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7257306/","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust stock value prediction using support vector machines with particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"540.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055571S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7257306","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7257311,"authors":[{"name":"Shengcai Liu","affiliation":["USTC-Birmingham Joint Research Institute in Intelligent Computation and Its Applications (UBRI), University of Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Shengcai","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085614652"},{"name":"Yufan Wei","affiliation":["USTC-Birmingham Joint Research Institute in Intelligent Computation and Its Applications (UBRI), University of Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Yufan","lastName":"Wei","id":"37085610296"},{"name":"Ke Tang","affiliation":["USTC-Birmingham Joint Research Institute in Intelligent Computation and Its Applications (UBRI), University of Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Tang","id":"37402030500"},{"name":"A.

A logical request is to maximize end users' long-term benefit. Thus, the overall long-term QoS properties of the composite service should be optimized and the users' requirements during the period should be satisfied. However, the benefit-maximization has not been considered under the background of long-term based CSCP in existing research yet. To fill this gap, in this paper, a new formulation LCSCP is proposed to define the long-term based CSCP as an optimization problem. Then, for the sake of efficiency, three meta-heuristic approaches (i.e, Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing and Tabu Search) are studied. Comprehensive experiments are designed and conducted to test their various aspects of performance on different test sets with different workflows. Experimental results provide a basic perspective of how these three widely adopted meta-heuristic frameworks work on this new problem, which can be baseline work for further research.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2015.7257311","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229815/7256859/07257311.pdf","startPage":"3362","endPage":"3369","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2015.7257311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7256859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS-aware long-term based service composition in cloud computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7257311","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7257311/","displayDocTitle":"QoS-aware long-term based service composition in cloud computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15440692","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7257311/","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS-aware long-term based service composition in cloud computing","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"545.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113658S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229815","isNumber":"7256859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229815","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7256859","articleId":"7257311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7257317,"authors":[{"name":"Qin Chen","affiliation":["Facility Design and Instrument Institute, China Aerodynamic R&D Center, Minayang, China"],"firstName":"Qin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085738467"},{"name":"Cheng Fu","affiliation":["Facility Design and Instrument Institute, China Aerodynamic R&D Center, Minayang, China"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Fu","id":"37085735639"},{"name":"Qingfu Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Qingfu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37275872700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7492-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7491-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"7257317","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On performance of decomposition-based MOEAs in noisy environment","abstract":"Real world optimization often involves noises and uncertainty.

Certain design techniques of astronomical sensors were combined with new methods of CCD charge transfer and large-format integrated circuit fabrication to create a 4096 pixel \u00d7 3112 pixel detector.

The goal of communication is to achieve reliability between Alice and Bob, but also confidentiality despite Eve's presence. Wiretap channels are declined in all kinds of flavors, depending on the underlying channels used by the three players: discrete memoryless channels, additive Gaussian noise channels, or fading channels, to name a few. In this survey, we focus on the case where the three players use multiple-antenna channels with Gaussian noise to communicate. After summarizing known results for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channels, both in terms of achievable reliable data rate (capacity) and code design, we introduce the MIMO wiretap channel. We then state the MIMO wiretap capacity, summarize the idea of the proof(s) behind this result, and comment on the insights given by the proofs on the physical meaning of the secrecy capacity. We finally discuss design criteria for MIMO wiretap codes.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2015.2468077","startPage":"1874","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/7270357/07258309.pdf","endPage":"1882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7270357","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2015.2468077","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7258309/","displayDocTitle":"A Perspective on the MIMO Wiretap Channel","volume":"103","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7258309/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15456800","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-0932428, CCF-1018927, CCF-1423663 and CCF-1409204"},{"fundingName":"Qualcomm Inc."},{"fundingName":"NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory"},{"fundingName":"King Abdulaziz University"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004052","fundingName":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Perspective on the MIMO Wiretap Channel","sourcePdf":"jproc-oggier-2468077-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057171S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"7270357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7270357","articleId":"7258309","onlineDate":"11 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7258313,"authors":[{"name":"Amitav Mukherjee","affiliation":["Radio Access Technologies group at Ericsson Research, San Jose, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/7270357/7258313/mukhe-2466548-small.gif","p":["\nAmitav Mukherjee (Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree from the University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA, in 2005, the M.S. degree from Wichita State University, Wichita, KS, USA, in 2007, both in electrical engineering, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA, in 2012.","He is currently a Research Engineer at Ericsson Research, San Jose, CA, USA, where he is involved in 3GPP LTE-A RAN1 standardization.

The limited hardware, low-complexity, and severe energy constraints of MTC devices present unique communication and security challenges. As a result, robust physical-layer security methods that can supplement or even replace lightweight cryptographic protocols are appealing solutions. In this paper, we present an overview of low-complexity physical-layer security schemes that are suitable for the IoT. A local IoT deployment is modeled as a composition of multiple sensor and data subnetworks, with uplink communications from sensors to controllers, and downlink communications from controllers to actuators. The state of the art in physical-layer security for sensor networks is reviewed, followed by an overview of communication network security techniques. We then pinpoint the most energy-efficient and low-complexity security techniques that are best suited for IoT sensing applications. This is followed by a discussion of candidate low-complexity schemes for communication security, such as on-off switching and space-time block codes. The paper concludes by discussing open research issues and avenues for further work, especially the need for a theoretically well-founded and holistic approach for incorporating complexity constraints in physical-layer security designs.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2015.2466548","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/7270357/07258313.pdf","startPage":"1747","endPage":"1761","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7270357","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2015.2466548","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical-Layer Security in the Internet of Things: Sensing and Communication Confidentiality Under Resource Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7258313","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Physical-Layer Security in the Internet of Things: Sensing and Communication Confidentiality Under Resource Constraints","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7258313/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15456810","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7258313/","volume":"103","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical-Layer Security in the Internet of Things: Sensing and Communication Confidentiality Under Resource Constraints","sourcePdf":"jproc-mukherjee-2466548-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147122S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"7270357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"187","xplore-issue":"7270357","articleId":"7258313","onlineDate":"11 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7258314,"authors":[{"name":"M.

CCPSs facilitate the seamless integration of devices in the physical world (e.g., sensors, cameras, microphones, speakers, and GPS devices) with cyberspace. This enables a range of emerging applications or systems such as patient or health monitoring, which require patient locations to be tracked. These systems integrate a large number of physical devices such as sensors with localization technologies (e.g., GPS and wireless local area networks) to generate, sense, analyze, and share huge quantities of medical and user-location data for complex processing. However, there are a number of challenges regarding these systems in terms of the positioning of patients, ubiquitous access, large-scale computation, and communication. Hence, there is a need for an infrastructure or system that can provide scalability and ubiquity in terms of huge real-time data processing and communications in the cyber or cloud space. To this end, this paper proposes a cloud-supported cyber-physical localization system for patient monitoring using smartphones to acquire voice and electroencephalogram signals in a scalable, real-time, and efficient manner. The proposed approach uses Gaussian mixture modeling for localization and is shown to outperform other similar methods in terms of error estimation.","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2015.2470644","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/7875385/07258314.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2015.2470644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7875385","startPage":"118","endPage":"127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud-Supported Cyber\u2013Physical Localization Framework for Patients Monitoring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7258314","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cloud-Supported Cyber\u2013Physical Localization Framework for Patients Monitoring","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7258314/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2015","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16724817","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7258314/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University","grantNumber":"RGP-228"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud-Supported Cyber\u2013Physical Localization Framework for Patients Monitoring","sourcePdf":"jsyst-hossain-2470644-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078116S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"7875385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"7875385","articleId":"7258314","onlineDate":"11 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7258329,"authors":[{"name":"Haiyang Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haiyang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37537712400"},{"name":"Lianrong Ma","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lianrong","lastName":"Ma","id":"37536693300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7258329","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":265},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Upper bound","Iterative decoding","Mathematical model","Reed-Solomon codes","Error analysis","Closed-form solutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parity check codes","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full-length RS-LDPC codes","minimum distance","Reed-Solomon code","finite field","low density parity check code","closed-form expressions","minimum-weight codewords"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RS-LDPC codes","minimum distance","vector representation"]},{"kwd":["RS-LDPC codes","minimum distance","vector representation"]}],"abstract":"Let q be a power of 2 and y \u2264 q an integer.

The multiview extension, MV-HEVC, allows efficient coding of multiple camera views and associated auxiliary pictures, and can be implemented by reusing single-layer decoders without changing the block-level processing modules since block-level syntax and decoding processes remain unchanged. Bit rate savings compared with HEVC simulcast are achieved by enabling the use of inter-view references in motion-compensated prediction. The more advanced 3D video extension, 3D-HEVC, targets a coded representation consisting of multiple views and associated depth maps, as required for generating additional intermediate views in advanced 3D displays. Additional bit rate reduction compared with MV-HEVC is achieved by specifying new block-level video coding tools, which explicitly exploit statistical dependencies between video texture and depth and specifically adapt to the properties of depth maps. The technical concepts and features of both extensions are presented in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2477935","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2477935","startPage":"35","endPage":"49","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/7372356/07258339.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7372356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overview of the Multiview and 3D Extensions of High Efficiency Video Coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7258339/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Overview of the Multiview and 3D Extensions of High Efficiency Video Coding","volume":"26","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2016","accessionNumber":"15689048","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7258339/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Overview of the Multiview and 3D Extensions of High Efficiency Video Coding","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-tech-2477935-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.261332S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7372356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"246","xplore-issue":"7372356","articleId":"7258339","onlineDate":"11 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7258342,"authors":[{"name":"Junlin Hu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/7723941/7258342/hu-2477936-small.gif","p":["Junlin Hu received the B.Eng. degree from the Xi\u2019an University of Technology, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2008, and the M.Eng. degree from Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China, in 2012.

Unlike most existing appearance-based visual trackers, which use hand-crafted similarity metrics, our DML tracker learns a nonlinear distance metric to classify the target object and background regions using a feed-forward neural network architecture. Since there are usually large variations in visual objects caused by varying deformations, illuminations, occlusions, motions, rotations, scales, and cluttered backgrounds, conventional linear similarity metrics cannot work well in such scenarios. To address this, our proposed DML tracker first learns a set of hierarchical nonlinear transformations in the feed-forward neural network to project both the template and particles into the same feature space where the intra-class variations of positive training pairs are minimized and the interclass variations of negative training pairs are maximized simultaneously. Then, the candidate that is most similar to the template in the learned deep network is identified as the true target. Experiments on the benchmark data set including 51 challenging videos show that our DML tracker achieves a very competitive performance with the state-of-the-art trackers.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2477936","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/7723941/07258342.pdf","startPage":"2056","endPage":"2068","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2477936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7723941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Metric Learning for Visual Tracking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7258342","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7258342/","displayDocTitle":"Deep Metric Learning for Visual Tracking","volume":"26","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16425705","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7258342/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001381","fundingName":"Rapid-Rich Object Search Laboratory through the National Research Foundation, Singapore, under its Interactive Digital Media within the Strategic Research Programme"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Metric Learning for Visual Tracking","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-hu-2477936-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125597S","chronDate":"Nov.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7723941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7723941","articleId":"7258342","onlineDate":"11 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7258343,"authors":[{"name":"Chunyan Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/7765074/7258343/xu-2477937-small.gif","p":["Chunyan Xu received the B.Sc. degree from Shandong Normal University, Jinan, China, in 2007, the M.Sc. degree from Huazhong Normal University, Wuhan, China, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree from the School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, in 2015.","She was a Visiting Scholar with the National University of Singapore, Singapore, from 2013 to 2015.

In this paper, we introduce the cross-loss-function regularization for boosting the generalization capability of the DNN, which results in the multi-loss regularized DNN (ML-DNN) framework. For a particular learning task, e.g., image classification, only a single-loss function is used for all previous DNNs, and the intuition behind the multiloss framework is that the extra loss functions with different theoretical motivations (e.g., pairwise loss and LambdaRank loss) may drag the algorithm away from overfitting to one particular single-loss function (e.g., softmax loss). In the training stage, we pretrain the model with the single-core-loss function and then warm start the whole ML-DNN with the convolutional parameters transferred from the pretrained model. In the testing stage, the outputs by the ML-DNN from different loss functions are fused with average pooling to produce the ultimate prediction. The experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST, and SVHN) demonstrate that the proposed ML-DNN framework, instantiated by the recently proposed network in network, considerably outperforms all other state-of-the-art methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7258343/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","volume":"26","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2016","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16518832","htmlLink":"/document/7258343/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-loss Regularized Deep Neural Network","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572214 and U1233119"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council Discovery Projects Funding Scheme","grantNumber":"DP140102270"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-loss Regularized Deep Neural Network","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-xu-2477937-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095553S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7765074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"7765074","articleId":"7258343","onlineDate":"11 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7258345,"authors":[{"name":"Jianquan Lu","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jianquan","lastName":"Lu","id":"37597286200"},{"name":"Jie Zhong","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37085361426"},{"name":"Chi Huang","affiliation":["College of Mathematics, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, China"],"firstName":"Chi","lastName":"Huang","id":"38026488100"},{"name":"Jinde Cao","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jinde","lastName":"Cao","id":"37290969000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"7258345","dbTime":"37 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":155,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":839},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"abstract":"This technical note presents analytical investigations of reachability and controllability of Boolean control networks (BCNs) with pinning controllers.

For this purpose, a 12/8 SRM has been designed at 22 000 r/min and 150 kW and two stages have been applied. In the first stage, a new equivalent stiffness of the frame is utilized in order to estimate the resonant frequencies for different frame shapes. The paper provides a mathematical calculation method and evaluates its effectiveness with finite-element simulations. The results indicate an improvement between 4% and 25% in the estimation natural frequencies. The second stage includes the vibration and acoustic noise analysis using 3-D finite-element method. Considerations for acoustic noise reduction in high-speed SRM using different frame types and cooling ribs are discussed.

Meanwhile, the high-performance computing world undergoes a trend toward heterogeneity. However, it is never easy to develop domain-specific applications on heterogeneous systems while maximizing the system efficiency. In this paper, a novel framework, namely, cloud-based heterogeneous computing framework (CHCF), is proposed with a set of tools and techniques for compilation, optimization, and execution of multimedia mining applications on heterogeneous systems. With the aid of the compiler and the utility library provided by CHCF, users are able to develop multimedia mining applications rapidly and efficiently. The proposed framework employs a number of techniques, including adaptive data partitioning, knowledge-based hierarchical scheduling, and performance estimation, to achieve high computing performance. As one of the most important multimedia mining applications, large-scale image retrieval is investigated based on the proposed CHCF. The scalability, computing performance, and programmability of CHCF are studied for large-scale image retrieval by case studies and experimental evaluations. The experimental results demonstrate that CHCF can achieve good scalability and significant computing performance improvements for image retrieval.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2477939","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2477939","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/7343760/07258354.pdf","startPage":"1900","endPage":"1913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7343760","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7258354/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"CHCF: A Cloud-Based Heterogeneous Computing Framework for Large-Scale Image Retrieval","volume":"25","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15647637","htmlLink":"/document/7258354/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61472281"},{"fundingName":"National 863 Program of China","grantNumber":"2014AA015101"},{"fundingName":"Shu Guang Project through the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission and Shanghai Education Development Foundation","grantNumber":"12SG23"},{"fundingName":"Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at the Shanghai Institutions of Higher Learning","grantNumber":"GZ2015005"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"0800219270"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CHCF: A Cloud-Based Heterogeneous Computing Framework for Large-Scale Image Retrieval","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-wang-2477939-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149174S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7343760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7343760","articleId":"7258354","onlineDate":"11 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7258365,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaomin Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Windsor, Windsor, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/7410138/7258365/lu-small.gif","p":["Xiaomin Lu (S'11\u2013M'12) received the Bachelor's\n degree in engineering from Sun-Yet Sen University, Guangdong, China, in July 2010, and the Doctoral degree in\n electrical and computer engineering from the University of Windsor, Windsor, ON, Canada, in 2014.","She is currently a Research Engineer.

First, motivation for the employment of IPMSM with damper bars for integrated charging is provided and justified. Thereafter, a novel parameter determination method based on dq-axis theory to determine the parameters of a laboratory IPMSM with dampers is proposed and experimentally validated. The determined parameters are then employed to design, control, and compare the performance of an integrated charging system incorporating an IPMSM drive with and without damper bars.

Current regulation under these faults is particularly challenging because optimal torque control strategy generates nonsinusoidal current references with unbalance in both fundamental and higher order working harmonics, to achieve minimal copper losses and torque ripple under fault condition. Under field-weakening operation, voltage limit introduces additional control problems. The paper describes a solution for these control issues by employing a novel controller in stationary frame. This control strategy allows minimal reconfiguration of the control structure from healthy to postfault operation.

In this paper, we propose a general CNN-based multi-modal learning framework for RGB-D object recognition. We first construct deep CNN layers for color and depth separately, which are then connected with a carefully designed multi-modal layer. This layer is designed to not only discover the most discriminative features for each modality, but is also able to harness the complementary relationship between the two modalities. The results of the multi-modal layer are back-propagated to update parameters of the CNN layers, and the multi-modal feature learning and the back-propagation are iteratively performed until convergence. Experimental results on two widely used RGB-D object datasets show that our method for general multi-modal learning achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods specifically designed for RGB-D data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7258382/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15553471","htmlLink":"/document/7258382/","displayDocTitle":"Large-Margin Multi-Modal Deep Learning for RGB-D Object Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-Margin Multi-Modal Deep Learning for RGB-D Object Recognition","sourcePdf":"tmm-wang-2476655-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120899S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"7302100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"7302100","articleId":"7258382","onlineDate":"11 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7258396,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Hee Yoo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea","Agency for Defense Development, The 1st Research and Development Institute, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Chung-Hee","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37085380589"},{"name":"Dong-Kuk Lim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Kuk","lastName":"Lim","id":"38477198500"},{"name":"Hyun-Kyo Jung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Hyun-Kyo","lastName":"Jung","id":"37292316100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"7258396","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":573},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7258396","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Forging","Torque","Permanent magnet motors","Electromagnetics","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","electromagnetic devices","optimisation","permanent magnet motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic machine design","multivariable optimization algorithm","interior permanent magnet motor","compressed sensing","surrogate model","big bang-big crunch method","evolutionary multimodal optimization algorithm","electromagnetic field calculation","nonlinear optimization algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electromagnetic machine design","evolutionary algorithm","multimodal optimization","surrogate model"]},{"kwd":["Electromagnetic machine design","evolutionary algorithm","multimodal optimization","surrogate model"]}],"abstract":"The design of an electromagnetic machine is a nonlinear, multivariable, and multimodal optimization problem that incurs a great deal of computation time when calculating electromagnetic fields.

This perspective is well suited to pictorially, symbolically, and quantitatively representing the nonlinear, dynamic, and stochastic (noisy) ordinary and partial differential equations that rigorously describe the molecular circuits of synthetic biology. This perspective enables us to construct a canonical analog circuit schematic that helps unify and review the operation of many fundamental circuits that have been built in synthetic biology at the DNA, RNA, protein, and small-molecule levels over nearly two decades. We review 17 circuits in the literature as particular examples of feedforward and feedback analog circuits that arise from special topological cases of the canonical analog circuit schematic. Digital circuit operation of these circuits represents a special case of saturated analog circuit behavior and is automatically incorporated as well. Many issues that have prevented synthetic biology from scaling are naturally represented in analog circuit schematics. Furthermore, the deep similarity between the Boltzmann thermodynamic equations that describe noisy electronic current flow in subthreshold transistors and noisy molecular flux in biochemical reactions has helped map analog circuit motifs in electronics to analog circuit motifs in cells and vice versa via a `cytomorphic' approach. Thus, a body of knowledge in analog electronic circuit design, analysis, simulation, and implementation may also be useful in the robust and efficient design of molecular circuits in synthetic biology, helping it to scale to more complex circuits in the future.","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2015.2461446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7274217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2015.2461446","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/4156126/7274217/07258405.pdf","startPage":"453","endPage":"474","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthetic Biology: A Unifying View and Review Using Analog Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Synthetic Biology: A Unifying View and Review Using Analog Circuits","volume":"9","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7258405/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15474759","pubMedId":"26372648","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7258405/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":""},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":""}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Synthetic Biology: A Unifying View and Review Using Analog Circuits","sourcePdf":"tbcas-teo-2461446-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.283227S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"7274217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7274217","articleId":"7258405","onlineDate":"11 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7258406,"authors":[{"name":"Min-Yong Jung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7336577/7258406/7258406-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Min-Yong Jung received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Pusan national University, Pusan, Korea, in 2010, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2013.

It is assumed that the finite-duration amplitude modulated, i.e., pulse-amplitude modulated (PAM), concentration of a certain type of molecule is used for information transmission. The bacterial signaling pathway is modified to transduce the input molecules to the output signal, i.e., produce green fluorescent protein (GFP). The bacterial signal transduction is composed of a set of biochemical reactions which impose randomness on the response. Therefore, the input-output relation, the timing issues, and the noise effects for the bacteria response are characterized based on both analytical and experimental observations. Sampling schemes for the raw bacteria response are proposed based on the total response duration, the peak value, the ramp-up slope, and the ramp-down slope. Each sampling scheme is shown to be providing a one-to-one and monotonic function of the input. The sampling based on the ramp-up slope is shown to be statistically favorable for the detection of PAM molecular signals. Accordingly, the time interval selection and non-coherent sampling are studied for the efficient calculation of the ramp-up slope from the raw bacteria response. This work provides a basis for the sampling of the raw bacteria response and enables accurate detection of PAM molecular signals via bacterial response for MC and sensing applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/4156126/7274217/07258407.pdf","startPage":"505","endPage":"517","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2015.2465182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2015.2465182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7274217","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7258407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Sampling of Bacterial Signal Transduction for Detection of Pulse-Amplitude Modulated Molecular Signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microorganisms","Noise","Delays","Proteins","Gene expression","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological techniques","cellular transport","microorganisms","molecular biophysics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bacterial signal transduction sampling","molecular signal detection","pulse-amplitude modulated molecular signals","molecular communication","finite duration amplitude-modulated molecular signals","pulse amplitude modulated molecular signals","bacterial signaling pathway","input molecule transduction","green fluorescent protein","GFP","biochemical reactions","response randomness","input-output relation","timing issues","noise effects","monotonic function","time interval selection","noncoherent sampling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bacterial signal transduction","detection","microfluidics","molecular communication","systems biology"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Bacteria","Models, Biological","Signal Transduction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7258407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Sampling of Bacterial Signal Transduction for Detection of Pulse-Amplitude Modulated Molecular Signals","volume":"9","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7258407/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15474762","pubMedId":"26372649","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Sampling of Bacterial Signal Transduction for Detection of Pulse-Amplitude Modulated Molecular Signals","sourcePdf":"tbcas-bicen-2465182-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114832S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"7274217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7274217","articleId":"7258407","onlineDate":"11 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7258409,"authors":[{"name":"Yashar M.

The capacity of such channels is computed and analyzed using three power allocation strategies: waterfilling, uniform, and on-off uniform power allocation across the signal bandwidth. Our analysis considers the effects of imperfect channel estimation, delayed feedback, and pilot overhead, which are found to contribute to about 1 (b/s)/Hz loss from 4 (b/s)/Hz at 20-dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the experimental channel. We find that given the long feedback delays associated with acoustic channels, all-on uniform power allocation, which does not require feedback and is simple to implement, emerges as a justified practical solution that outperforms the other strategies. Furthermore, when considering acoustic-specific propagation effects, such as frequency-dependent attenuation and colored noise, considerable gain can be achieved by selecting the frequency band according to the attenuation pattern and the available transmit power, e.g., at least 6-dB gain for a 10-km link when compared to transmission over a preselected frequency band of 10-15 kHz.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/48/7295647/07258409.pdf","startPage":"785","endPage":"795","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2015.2451251","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2015.2451251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7295647","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7258409","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Achievable Rate of a Class of Acoustic Channels and Practical Power Allocation Strategies for OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel capacity","Fading","OFDM","Underwater communication","Channel models","Underwater acoustics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","channel estimation","fading channels","feedback","Gaussian channels","OFDM modulation","resource allocation","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-input-multiple-output underwater acoustic communication channels","SIMO underwater acoustic communication channels","propagation path","complex-valued Gaussian block-fading model","power allocation strategies","waterfilling uniform power allocation","on-off uniform power allocation","signal bandwidth","imperfect channel estimation","delayed feedback","pilot overhead","all-on uniform power allocation","acoustic-specific propagation effects","OFDM systems","distance 10 km","frequency 10 kHz to 15 kHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel capacity","information rate","lower bound","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","power allocation","Rician fading","underwater acoustic communications","waterfilling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7258409/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"On the Achievable Rate of a Class of Acoustic Channels and Practical Power Allocation Strategies for OFDM Systems","volume":"40","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7258409/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15520418","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ONR","grantNumber":"N00014-09-1-0700"},{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CNS-1212999"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Achievable Rate of a Class of Acoustic Channels and Practical Power Allocation Strategies for OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"joe-aval-2451251-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088787S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"7295647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7295647","articleId":"7258409","onlineDate":"11 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7258468,"authors":[{"name":"Boris Murmann","affiliation":["Stanford University"],"bio":{"p":["Boris murmann (murmann@stanford.edu) is an associate professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University.

The past 15 years of innovation have clearly refuted such fears. Driven by a combination of application pull, architectural modifications, and relentless optimization, we have seen steady improvements in several key performance metrics. The purpose of this article is to enumerate some of the pertaining progress slopes, explain their possible foundations, and speculate about their remaining lifetime. In this context, it is important to note that this general subject has received a great deal of attention over the years, as evidenced by the large number of ADC surveys and trend papers (see, e.g., [1]-[20]).

Applications such as always-on reactive sensors for natural human-device interfaces, as well as multiple consumer and industrial applications for the Internet of Things (IoT), require ultralow-power designs beyond the promise of state-of-the art data converters. These devices demand a new approach to analog-digital system partitioning with the goal of significant overall reduction in energy consumption. Unlike most multimedia systems, many IoT applications require signal information extraction or signature extraction, rather than full reconstruction of the original sensed waveforms. Under these conditions, Nyquist rate sampling may no longer offer the optimal digitization scheme. Recent work on alternative sensor digitization strategies targets drastic sampling rate reductions in analog-to-digital conversion, while preserving the valuable relevant information (knowledge) present in the sensed signal. This article aims to give an overview of the emerging field of analog-to-information conversion in light of various sub-Nyquist sampling techniques recently appearing in literature,as well as to highlight some of the opportunities, challenges, and new applications such converters offer.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563670/7258467/07258493.pdf","startPage":"67","endPage":"80","publicationTitle":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MSSC.2015.2442394","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSSC.2015.2442394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7258467","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7258493","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Where Analog Meets Digital: Analog?to?Information Conversion and Beyond","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth allocation","Information rates","Feature extraction","Sensors","Technological innovation","Signal processing","Energy efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","energy consumption","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog-to-information conversion","energy efficiency","long battery life","low latency","ultralow-power sensing","monitoring systems","reactive sensors","natural human-device interfaces","Internet of Things","IoT","data converters","analog-digital system","energy consumption","multimedia systems","signal information extraction","signature extraction","sensed waveform reconstruction","Nyquist rate sampling techniques","optimal digitization scheme","sensor digitization strategy","sampling rate reductions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7258493/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Summer  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Where Analog Meets Digital: Analog?to?Information Conversion and Beyond","volume":"7","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7258493/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Summer 2015","accessionNumber":"15439792","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Where Analog Meets Digital: Analog?to?Information Conversion and Beyond","sourcePdf":"07mssc03-verhelst-2442394-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122092S","chronDate":"Summer  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4563670","isNumber":"7258467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563670","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"7258467","articleId":"7258493","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7258755,"authors":[{"name":"Otto H.

Newly designed systems, for the sake of maximum utilization of channel capacity, should use many of the techniques proposed for improving NTSC, such as high-rate cameras and displays, but should use the component, rather than composite, technique for color multiplexing. A preference is expressed for noncompatible new systems, both for increased design flexibility and on the basis of likely consumer behavior. Some sample systems are described that achieve very high quality in the present 6-MHz channels, full \u201cHDTV\u201d at the CCIR rate of 216 Mbits/sec, or \u201cbetter-than-35mm\u201d at about 500 Mbits/sec. Possibilities for even higher efficiency using motion compensation are described.","doi":"10.5594/J03084","publicationTitle":"SMPTE Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"SMPTE Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227860/7258914/07258933.pdf","startPage":"734","endPage":"744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.5594/J03084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7258914","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Television Systems: NTSC and beyond","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7258933","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"SMPTE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7258933/","displayDocTitle":"Improved Television Systems: NTSC and beyond","volume":"96","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Television Systems: NTSC and beyond","sourcePdf":"10-5594_J03084.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033277S","chronDate":"Aug.  1987","isNumber":"7258914","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7227860","citationCount":"14","articleId":"7258933","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"SMPTE Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":7259360,"authors":[{"name":"Hieu V.

In particular, we investigate trade-off factors in designing efficient spectrum sensing techniques to maximize the throughputs and minimize the interferences. To maximize the throughputs of secondary users and minimize the interferences to primary users, it requires for a joint determination of the sensing and transmission parameters of the secondary users, such as sensing times, decision threshold vectors, and power allocation vectors. There is a conflict between these two objectives, thus a multiobjective optimization problem is introduced. We propose an analytical approach based on Newton's methods and nonlinear barrier method to solve this large-scale joint multiobjective optimization problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7259360/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15455128","htmlLink":"/document/7259360/","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"An analytical multiobjective optimization of joint spectrum sensing and power control in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analytical multiobjective optimization of joint spectrum sensing and power control in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074016S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7235859","isNumber":"7259359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7235859","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7259359","articleId":"7259360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7259364,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Feng","affiliation":["School of Aerospace Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, P.

Probabilistic programming allows artificial systems to better operate with uncertainty, and stochastic arithmetic provides a way to carry out approximate computations with few resources. As such, both are plausible models for natural cognition. Our work on the automatic design of probabilistic machines computing soft inferences with an arithmetic based on stochastic bitstreams allowed us to develop the following compilation toolchain: given a high level description of some general problem (typically to infer some knowledge from a model given some observations), formalized as a Bayesian Program, our toolchain automatically builds a low level description of an electronic circuit computing the corresponding probabilistic inference. This circuit can then be implemented and tested on reconfigurable logic.We designed as a validating example a circuit description of a Bayesian filter solving the problem of Pseudo Noise sequence acquisition in telecommunications.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 14th International Conference on Cognitive Informatics & Cognitive Computing (ICCI*CC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 14th

to the CP-OFDM, filter bank based multi-carrier with offset quadrature amplitude modulation (FBMC/OQAM) is more suitable for cognitive radio scenarios by using synthesis and analysis filter banks with well time-frequency location(TFL) property. Being a favorable candidate physical waveform for the cognitive radio system, FBMC/OQAM has attracted much attention. However, real orthogonality instead of complex orthogonality makes the combination of MIMO and FBMC/OQAM system challenging. In this paper, the implemention issues of the FBMC/OQAM system is researched. Considering various prototype filters used, a weighted signal-to-leakage-and-noise ratio (WSLNR) based precoding method is proposed to mitigate intrinsic interference, the simulation results show that the proposed method is more robust to the channel frequency selectivity compared to the others. The spectral comparison for the prototype filters of the FBMC/OQAM and the CP-OFDM recommends the consideration of FBMC/OQAM in the future CR systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7259375/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15455154","htmlLink":"/document/7259375/","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"An improved multicarrier based waveform design for cognitive radio communication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved multicarrier based waveform design for cognitive radio communication","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072546S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7235859","isNumber":"7259359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7235859","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7259359","articleId":"7259375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":7259377,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph Lilleberg","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Southwest Minnesota State University, Marshall, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Lilleberg","id":"37085644869"},{"name":"Yun Zhu","affiliation":["Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, US"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Zhu"},{"name":"Yanqing Zhang","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA"],"firstName":"Yanqing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085434085"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7290-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7289-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7259377","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":139,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4382},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Support vector machines and Word2vec for text classification with semantic features","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 14th International Conference on Cognitive Informatics & Cognitive Computing (ICCI*CC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7235859/7259359/07259377.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"140","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 14th International Conference on Cognitive Informatics & Cognitive Computing (ICCI*CC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCI-CC.2015.7259377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7259359","doi":"10.1109/ICCI-CC.2015.7259377","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probabilistic logic","Semantics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","feature extraction","pattern classification","support vector machines","text analysis","word processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["support vector machines","Word2vec","text classification","semantic features","text mining community","vector representation","tf-idf"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["word2vec","tf-idf","text classification","scikit-learn","support vector machines","unsupervised learning","supervised learning","semantic features"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7259377","abstract":"With the rapid expansion of new available information presented to us online on a daily basis, text classification becomes imperative in order to classify and maintain it.

Based on the assumption that word2vec brings extra semantic features that helps in text classification, our work demonstrates the effectiveness of word2vec by showing that tf-idf and word2vec combined can outperform tf-idf because word2vec provides complementary features (e.g. semantics that tf-idf can't capture) to tf-idf.

To overcome these limitations, a promising technique called compressed sensing (CS) is adopted to develop the video encoding algorithm. CS is the process of acquiring and reconstructing a signal which is sparse thus reducing the computational complexity. The source video frames are converted into sparse components by applying sparsifying transform. The measurements obtained from the sparse components using CS are quantized and encoded by proposed algorithm for efficient storage and transmission. To represent the data with reduced number of bits an efficient compressed sensing based quantized prediction Huffman encoder is presented in this paper. The orthogonal matching pursuit recovery algorithm is used at the reconstruction side to get back the original sparse components. The performance of the video encoder is evaluated using compression ratio in terms of percentage. The PSNR and SSIM of the recovered frames show promising results thus prove to be compatible for wireless multimedia sensor networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing based quantization with prediction encoding for video transmission in WSN","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Computation of Power, Energy, Information and Communication (ICCPEIC)","doi":"10.1109/ICCPEIC.2015.7259441","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Computation of Power, Energy, Information and Communication (ICCPEIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227958/7259434/07259441.pdf","startPage":"0052","endPage":"0058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCPEIC.2015.7259441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7259434","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7259441","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7259441/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing based quantization with prediction encoding for video transmission in WSN","conferenceDate":"22-23 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7259441/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15454723","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing based quantization with prediction encoding for video transmission in WSN","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"ArunaNIC238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060951S","chronDate":"22-23 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227958","isNumber":"7259434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227958","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7259434","articleId":"7259441","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7259445,"authors":[{"name":"BharatKumar Tak","affiliation":["Sardar Patel Institute of Technology, Andheri Mumbai, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7227958/7259434/7259445/7259445-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bharatkumar Tak pursuing his M.E degree in Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering from Mumbai University.

Cognitive radio has recently attracted a lot of research interest while much more research has been done on spectrum sensing and allocation problems. Due to pre allocation and the fixed spectrum based hardware design it is become difficult for the devices to switch to different channels or the frequency range in order to gain the access through any available medium. To solve the complexity problem, autonomic computing has been proposed to enable the network self-management where device can switch to available network on demand. Proposed system is mainly aimed at designing and implementing a dynamic spectrum searching and gaining the access on mutual bonding. Every device in network will try to search and connect default assigned or preferred network and if the network not available then try to search for next available service provider as per mentioned in priority table of every device in auto search mode or as per the manual configuration of the device.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7259470/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15454734","htmlLink":"/document/7259470/","conferenceDate":"22-23 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic spectrum access gaining devices for wireless sensor network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic spectrum access gaining devices for wireless sensor network","confLoc":"Melmaruvathur, India","sourcePdf":"MeghaThakreIC223.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054143S","chronDate":"22-23 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227958","isNumber":"7259434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227958","xplore-issue":"7259434","articleId":"7259470","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7259503,"authors":[{"name":"Tangudu Ramji","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication, Aditya Institute of Technology and Management Tekkali, Srikakulam, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7227958/7259434/7259503/7259503-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tangudu Ramji received M.Tech degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar, in 2014 and B.Tech degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Teegala Krishna Reddy Engineering College, Hyderabad, in 2006.

But by this network, we are unable to save the both power and bandwidth in much manner. These parameters will create critical issues, when wired or wireless media affects by noise, and interference conditions. In this paper, the main objectives are to produce good tradeoff between power consumption, bandwidth consumption and good tradeoff between distributed computing power ratio (DCPR), bandwidth consumption.

Recently methods have been proposed which directly design fixed-structure LPV controllers using data available from the plant. These methods are however restricted to stable plants only.

A secure communication scheme based on the chaotic systems array is proposed. The masking signal of the new scheme is generated though processing the chaotic system array output signals with mathematical operations, signal process method or encryption algorithms. The types of chaotic system that formed chaotic system array, the control method of the array and the algorithms used for signal process can secondarily encrypt the secure communication system, which can make it work on a safer statue. The simulation results of basic secure communication cases which were built with Lorenz system and Chuas circuit show secure communication system constructed with chaotic system array works on a high security statue.

Unlike commonly studied canonical form systems whose neural-network based approximations have explicit relative degrees and can be directly used to derive controller parameters, non-canonical form systems usually do not have such a feature, because neural-network based approximations of such systems are still in a non-canonical form. It is well-known that control of non-canonical form nonlinear systems involves reparametrization of system dynamics. As demonstrated in this paper, it is also the case for neural-network approximated non-canonical form systems. Effective control of such systems is an open research problem, especially in the presence of uncertain parameters. This paper shows that it is necessary to reparametrize such neural-network systems for control design and that such reparametrization can be realized using a relative degree formulation, a concept yet to be studied for general neural network systems. The paper then derives a parametrized controller structure for effective control of general non-canonical form neural network systems, as the baseline controller for adaptation. An illustrative example is presented with simulation results to demonstrate the control design procedure, and to verify the effectiveness of such a new control design method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7259745/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15440187","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7259745/","publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Parametrized controller for non-canonical form nonlinear systems using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parametrized controller for non-canonical form nonlinear systems using neural networks","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"0153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072722S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225914","isNumber":"7259602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225914","xplore-issue":"7259602","articleId":"7259745","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7259783,"authors":[{"name":"Shulong Zhao","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Shulong","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085636870"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6389-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"7259783","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Observers","Mathematical model","Data models","Adaptive control","Adaptation models","Stability analysis","Tuning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","discrete systems","gradient methods","linear systems","nonlinear control systems","observers","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["general observer based data-driven control algorithm","nonlinear discrete system","I-O data","input and output data","mathematics model","pseudo gradient parameters","PG parameters","full form dynamic linearization","FFDL","adaptive observer","model free adaptive control","degree of freedom","DOF","tracking error","stability analysis","MATLAB environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Observer Data-driven","MFAC","PG","FFDL","Nonlinear discrete system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7259783","abstract":"In this paper, a general observer based data-driven control algorithm is proposed to adaptive control for discrete system using input and output (I/O) data.

Simulation results in MATLAB environment show the effectiveness and applicability of the control law.","doi":"10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7259783","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7259783","startPage":"1075","endPage":"1079","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225914/7259602/07259783.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7259602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A general observer based data-driven control for nonlinear discrete system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"A general observer based data-driven control for nonlinear discrete system","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7259783/","accessionNumber":"15453693","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7259783/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A general observer based data-driven control for nonlinear discrete system","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"0193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080529S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225914","isNumber":"7259602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225914","xplore-issue":"7259602","articleId":"7259783","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7259790,"authors":[{"name":"Lu Qi","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Wuyi University, Jiangmen, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Qi","id":"37085690537"},{"name":"Liang Xinrong","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Wuyi University, Jiangmen, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Xinrong","id":"37692531700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6389-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"7259790","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Traffic control","Algorithm design and analysis","Standards","Heuristic algorithms","Mathematical model","Particle swarm optimization","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","nonlinear control systems","particle swarm optimisation","road traffic control","simulated annealing","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["freeway traffic density control","improved particle swarm optimization algorithm","cell transmission model","CTM","freeway traffic flow","nonlinear process control technique","proportional and integral parameter","PI parameter","inertia weight value","simulated annealing algorithm","genetic algorithm","standard PSO algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle swarm algorithm","traffic flow model","freeway density control","nonlinear control technique"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7259790","abstract":"A cell transmission model (CTM) and an improved particle swarm algorithm are employed for density control in freeway mainlines.

Thirdly, freeway density controllers based on the improved PSO algorithm and the nonlinear process control technique are designed. This improved PSO algorithm is applied to optimize the proportional and integral (PI) parameters. The searching ability for finding the optimal PI parameters is enhanced by means of varying the inertia weight value and using simulated annealing algorithm at the same time. Finally, two simulation experiments are carried out to show the superiority of this approach. Compared to the genetic algorithm or the standard PSO algorithm, the improved PSO algorithm has smaller density errors.

To improve the quality of network sampling, this paper attempts to convert the complex network sampling process to an optimization problem, and proposes a novel sampling algorithm which is based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Exponent of power-law degree distribution and clustering coefficient of networks were set as optimization objectives. Subnets were sampled from scale-free network by random sampling method, and optimization objectives were optimized by multi-objective optimizer. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is used to verify that whether the sampling subnets conform to strict power-law degree distribution. Simulations show that the algorithm based on intelligent optimization methods could get better sample subnets than normal sampling algorithm.

Numerical simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7259870","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225914/7259602/07259870.pdf","startPage":"1577","endPage":"1582","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","publicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7259870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7259602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"State estimation of recurrent neural networks with two Markovian jumping parameters and mixed delays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7259870/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"State estimation of recurrent neural networks with two Markovian jumping parameters and mixed delays","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15453796","publicationDate":"July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7259870/","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"State estimation of recurrent neural networks with two Markovian jumping parameters and mixed delays","confLoc":"Hangzhou","sourcePdf":"0283.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056593S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225914","isNumber":"7259602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225914","xplore-issue":"7259602","articleId":"7259870","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7259875,"authors":[{"name":"Tian Qi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong","School of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, P.

We consider a structured multiplicative perturbation which consists of static, zero-mean stochastic processes and we assess the stability of system based on mean-square criteria. The mean-square stabilization problem for multi-input multi-output systems generally requires solving an optimization problem involving the spectral radius of a certain closed loop transfer function matrix. This problem in general is non-convex and by and large unresolved, only approximate solutions are available based on numerical algorithms resembling to the D-K iteration for \u03bc-synthesis. Our main contributions include the fundamental conditions, both necessary and sufficient, which insure that the multi-input multi-output minimum phase systems can be stabilized by output feedback in the mean-square sense. We provide a complete, computationally efficient solution in the form of a generalized eigenvalue problem readily solvable by means of linear matrix inequality optimization. For conceptual insights, limiting cases are analyzed in depth to characterize and quantify explicitly how the directions of unstable poles may affect the mean-square stabilizability of multi-input multi-output systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225914/7259602/07259875.pdf","startPage":"1605","endPage":"1612","publicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","doi":"10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7259875","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7259875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7259602","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7259875","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedback stabilization of MIMO systems in the presence of stochastic network uncertainties and delays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Stochastic processes","Stability criteria","Uncertainty","Transfer functions","Numerical stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","concave programming","control system synthesis","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","feedback","linear matrix inequalities","linear systems","mean square error methods","MIMO systems","perturbation techniques","stochastic processes","stochastic systems","transfer function matrices","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mean square stabilization problem","linear time-invariant system","stochastic multiplicative uncertainty","time delay","structured multiplicative perturbation","zero mean stochastic processes","mean square criterion","optimization problem","spectral radius","closed loop transfer function matrix","nonconvex programming","numerical algorithm","D-K iteration","\u03bc-synthesis","necessary and sufficient condition","multiple input multiple output minimum phase systems","output feedback","generalized eigenvalue problem","linear matrix inequality optimization","feedback stabilization","MIMO system","stochastic network uncertainty"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mean square stability and stabilization","constant time-delay","stochastic multiplicative uncertainty"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7259875/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Feedback stabilization of MIMO systems in the presence of stochastic network uncertainties and delays","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7259875/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15453986","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback stabilization of MIMO systems in the presence of stochastic network uncertainties and delays","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"0288.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079052S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225914","isNumber":"7259602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225914","xplore-issue":"7259602","articleId":"7259875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7259878,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang Yutian","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Statistics, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Yutian","id":"37542125700"},{"name":"Xue Yanmei","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Statistics, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing"],"firstName":"Xue","lastName":"Yanmei","id":"37085625327"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6389-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"7259878","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7259878","abstract":"This work concerns the stability of impulsive Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with time-varying delays, reaction-diffusion terms and Dirichlet boundary condition.

This paper transforms network reconstruction to be a signal recovery problem by means of compressive sensing. In the literature, the sensing matrix is determined by the network dynamic and measured states of nodes, which might violates the restriction on the coherence of the sensing matrix for exact recovery. This paper proposes random projection and zero component analysis to preprocess the sensing matrix in order to reduce the coherence of the sensing matrix. These two data whitening techniques are implemented in three different ways with different space complexity required, performing transformation on diagonal blocks, on multiple diagonal blocks and on the whole of the sensing matrix. Numerical simulations suggest that the latter method are effective to improve the quality of the reconstructed networks and comparisons are made among these methods and the ways they are implemented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network reconstruction based on compressive sensing","publicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","doi":"10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7259961","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225914/7259602/07259961.pdf","startPage":"2123","endPage":"2128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7259961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7259602","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7259961","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7259961/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Network reconstruction based on compressive sensing","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7259961/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15454104","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network reconstruction based on compressive sensing","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"0380.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058953S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225914","isNumber":"7259602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225914","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7259602","articleId":"7259961","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"}]
