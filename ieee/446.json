The frequency estimation is formulated as an optimization problem, where the goal is to minimize the estimation error. The use of GAs has the advantage of better immunity against noise disturbance present in the input data. In addition, this work investigates the implementation of a GA scheme in FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) in order obtain a device that can work properly in real time. The new approach is able to accurately estimate the frequency, voltage magnitude and phase angle, simulating an on-line frequency relay. The proposed methodology provides an efficient alternative for frequency relays with advantages in comparison with traditional approaches.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2007.4460008","startPage":"2020","endPage":"2025","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2007 - 33rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4459873/4459874/04460008.pdf","publicationTitle":"IECON 2007 - 33rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2007.4460008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459874","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Frequency Estimation Methodology using Genetic Algorithms in FPGA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Genetic algorithms","Field programmable gate arrays","Voltage","Relays","Frequency measurement","Phase measurement","Phase noise","Estimation error","Phase estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","frequency estimation","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency estimation methodology","genetic algorithms","FPGA","frequency deviation","voltage magnitude","phase angle","noisy sinusoid wave","field-programmable gate array","frequency relays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460008/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Frequency Estimation Methodology using Genetic Algorithms in FPGA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4460008/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2008","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9827583","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Frequency Estimation Methodology using Genetic Algorithms in FPGA","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IECON07-00-134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049645S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4459873","isNumber":"4459874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4459873","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4459874","articleId":"4460008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4460025,"authors":[{"name":"Seul Jung","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems and Emotional Engineering Laboratory, BK21 Mechatronics Group, Mechatronics Engineering Department, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seul","lastName":"Jung","id":"37278071900"},{"name":"T.

ANN is one of the popular methods in optimization of complex engineering problems compared to the classical statistical methods. In our study group, we consider some parameters as inputs: three bone densitometry parameters (BMD) (Femoral neck BMD, total body BMD and L2L4 spine BMD), three fractal parameters [1,5] (Hmin, Hmean, Hmax), and age of the patient. We studied three ANN structures with various inputs and hidden neurons. We have reached up to 81.66% correct classification. In comparison we have tested a classical discriminant analysis (Mahalanobis-Fisher) and we only obtained 72% of correct classification. We can conclude that ANN is one of the promising methods in the diagnosis of osteoporosis.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2007.4460070","pdfPath":"/iel5/4459873/4459874/04460070.pdf","startPage":"3039","endPage":"3044","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2007 - 33rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","publicationTitle":"IECON 2007 - 33rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2007.4460070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459874","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Estimation of Osteoporosis using Artificial Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460070/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Estimation of Osteoporosis using Artificial Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2008","accessionNumber":"9827644","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4460070/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Estimation of Osteoporosis using Artificial Neural Networks","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IECON07-00-196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.145485S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4459873","isNumber":"4459874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4459873","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4459874","articleId":"4460070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4460088,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Ma","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Ma","id":"37288993000"},{"name":"Xinke Wu","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Xinke","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281236600"},{"name":"Xiaogao Xie","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Xiaogao","lastName":"Xie","id":"37274129500"},{"name":"Guozhu Chen","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Guozhu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277946900"},{"name":"Zhaoming Qian","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Zhaoming","lastName":"Qian","id":"37277089400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0783-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"4460088","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":386},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4460088","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Buck converters","Clamps","Switches","Zero voltage switching","Pulse width modulation","Switching converters","Pulse width modulation converters","Capacitors","Stress","Switching frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM power convertors","zero voltage switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ZVS-PWM buck converter","active clamping cell","auxiliary inductor","parasitic capacitor","zero voltage switching"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a new ZVS-PWM Buck converter, which is based on the active clamping technique.

The digital amplifier using power MOSFET requires a modulator to modulate the reference signal into binary sequences. The modulator can be viewed as an over-sampled quantizer with noise-shaping requirement. One of the main issues in designing the modulator is to maintain stability while maximizing the range of the reference input signal. The quantization scheme resulting from the optimization is derived in detail to arrive at the stability condition under zero initial conditions. It shows the stability condition becomes more stringent when the relative degree of the shaping filter is high. Simulations results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the design methodology.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2007.4460112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2007.4460112","startPage":"1950","endPage":"1955","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2007 - 33rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4459873/4459874/04460112.pdf","publicationTitle":"IECON 2007 - 33rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459874","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System Analysis of an Optimal Noise Shaped Quantizer for Audio-band Digital Amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"System Analysis of an Optimal Noise Shaped Quantizer for Audio-band Digital Amplifier","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4460112/","accessionNumber":"9827685","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460112/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System Analysis of an Optimal Noise Shaped Quantizer for Audio-band Digital Amplifier","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IECON07-00-238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055056S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4459873","isNumber":"4459874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4459873","xplore-issue":"4459874","articleId":"4460112","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4460121,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Huang Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hsiuping Institute of Technology, Dali, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Huang","lastName":"Lu","id":"37351053600"},{"name":"Ching-Chih Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Chih","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37291087300"},{"name":"Chi-Ming Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hsiuping Institute of Technology, Dali, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Ming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37600003800"},{"name":"Yuan-Hai Charng","affiliation":["Department of Machine Engineering, Hsiuping Institute of Technology, Dali, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuan-Hai","lastName":"Charng","id":"37601185600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0783-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"4460121","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4460121","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive control","Recurrent neural networks","Plastics","Injection molding","Predictive models","Nonlinear systems","Temperature control","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Lyapunov method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","discrete time systems","injection moulding","learning (artificial intelligence)","Lyapunov methods","multivariable control systems","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","plastics industry","predictive control","process control","production engineering computing","recurrent neural nets","temperature control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multivariable predictive control","recurrent neural network","plastic injection molding processes","nonlinear discrete-time systems","temperature control","adaptive learning","RNN model","discrete Lyapunov stability theorem","bounded disturbances"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IECON.2007.4460121","pdfPath":"/iel5/4459873/4459874/04460121.pdf","publicationTitle":"IECON 2007 - 33rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2007 - 33rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","startPage":"792","endPage":"797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459874","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2007.4460121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictive Control Based on Recurrent Neural Network and Application to Plastic Injection Molding Processes","abstract":"This paper presents a predictive control based on recurrent neural network (RNN) for a class of nonlinear systems and investigates its application to temperature control of plastic injection molding processes.

In these situations, genetic algorithms are superior to gradient descent parameter learning algorithms. The idea of this paper is to identify unknown parameters of the distillation column model.

The soft phoneme segmentation technique is based on the characteristics of Thai language in that the vowel is the core of a syllable. The recognition system utilizes the discrete hidden Markov model to recognize the Thai phonemes, i.e., 21-class initial consonants, 18-class vowels, and 9-class final consonants. We use the Mel frequency with perceptual linear prediction as the features of a phoneme. We experiment the recognition system on both speaker-dependent and speaker-independent data sets recorded from 30 speakers. The experimental results show promising recognition performances in both cases.","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2007 - 33rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4459873/4459874/04460136.pdf","startPage":"251","endPage":"255","publicationTitle":"IECON 2007 - 33rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2007.4460136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2007.4460136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459874","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4460136","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thai Phoneme Soft Segmentation and Recognition Using Hidden Markov Models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Speech recognition","Frequency","Natural languages","Signal generators","Discrete wavelet transforms","Noise cancellation","Industrial Electronics Society","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","natural language processing","speech processing","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Thai phoneme soft segmentation","Thai phoneme recognition system","Thai language","discrete hidden Markov model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460136/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Thai Phoneme Soft Segmentation and Recognition Using Hidden Markov Models","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4460136/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9848745","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2008","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thai Phoneme Soft Segmentation and Recognition Using Hidden Markov Models","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IECON07-00-262.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068347S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4459873","isNumber":"4459874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4459873","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4459874","articleId":"4460136","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4460153,"authors":[{"name":"Shui-Chun Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan","Department of Electronic Engineering, National Chinyi Institute of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shui-Chun","lastName":"Lin","id":"37402313700"},{"name":"Ching-Chih Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Chih","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37291087300"},{"name":"Wen-Lung Luo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Lung","lastName":"Luo","id":"38123537200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0783-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"4460153","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":423},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive systems","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Neural networks","Motorcycles","Control systems","Mechatronics","DC motors","Mathematical model","Friction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","motorcycles","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","pendulums","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive neural network control","self-balancing two-wheeled scooter","DC motors","mechatronic system structure","motion surface","inverted pendulum","radial-basis- function neural network","rotation control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["adaptive netral network control","digital signal processing","gyroscope","invertedpendulum","robotics transporter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4460153","abstract":"This paper presents an adaptive neural network control for a two-wheeled self-balancing scooter for pedagogical purposes.

The robot has 6 DOF in the single support phase and four actuators. In addition to the reduced number of actuators, the interest of studying robots with point feet is that the feedback control solution must exploit the robot's natural dynamics in order to achieve balance while walking. We use an extension of the method of virtual constraints, a very successful method for planar bipeds, in order to simultaneously compute a periodic orbit and an autonomous feedback controller that realizes the orbit, for a 3D (spatial) bipedal walking robot. This method allows the computations for the controller design and the periodic orbit to be carried out on a 2-DOF subsystem of the 6-DOF robot model. The linearization of the Poincare map of the closed-loop system proves that the achieved periodic walking motion, at a speed of approximately one and a half body lengths per second, is exponentially stable.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotically Stable Walking of a Simple Underactuated 3D Bipedal Robot","publicationTitle":"IECON 2007 - 33rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2007.4460177","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2007 - 33rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4459873/4459874/04460177.pdf","startPage":"2766","endPage":"2771","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2007.4460177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459874","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4460177","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460177/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotically Stable Walking of a Simple Underactuated 3D Bipedal Robot","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4460177/","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9827699","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotically Stable Walking of a Simple Underactuated 3D Bipedal Robot","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IECON07-00-303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066424S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4459873","isNumber":"4459874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4459873","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4459874","articleId":"4460177","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4460178,"authors":[{"name":"Akihiko Yoneya","affiliation":["Nagoya Institute of Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Akihiko","lastName":"Yoneya","id":"37390085600"},{"name":"Kazuya Shinmura","affiliation":["Nagoya Institute of Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuya","lastName":"Shinmura","id":"38122872200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0783-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"4460178","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Feedback","Noise shaping","Digital filters","Pulse width modulation","Pulse amplifiers","Space vector pulse width modulation","Quantization","Frequency","Harmonic distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio-frequency amplifiers","feedback","filtering theory","harmonic distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polynomial feedback","noise shaping filter","fully digital audio amplifier","polynomial nonlinear feedback","harmonic distortion","floor noise","uniform PWM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4460178","abstract":"This paper proposes a noise shaping filter with polynomial nonlinear feedback for the fully digital audio amplifiers.

Sampling periods become shorter by using FPGAs, and it is expected that improvement of the performance of the motion control system. However in M method, which is the most generally used velocity estimation method, velocity resolution becomes low due to the short sampling period. This leads to a limitation of the performance, especially in acceleration control using a disturbance observer which requires accurate velocity information. There are several velocity estimation methods to improve the resolution. These methods require a dividing operation. From point of view of resource sharing and resource utilization of FPGAs, implementing divider is not desired. In this paper, velocity estimation which does not require any divider is proposed to improve the velocity resolution in the short sampling period system. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated by simulation, and the proposed method is implemented into position control system based on the acceleration control in experiments.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2007.4460234","publicationTitle":"IECON 2007 - 33rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2007 - 33rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4459873/4459874/04460234.pdf","startPage":"2349","endPage":"2354","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2007.4460234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459874","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4460234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Approach to Velocity Estimation Using FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460234/","displayDocTitle":"An Approach to Velocity Estimation Using FPGA","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4460234/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2008","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9827755","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Approach to Velocity Estimation Using FPGA","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IECON07-00-360.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074617S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4459873","isNumber":"4459874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4459873","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4459874","articleId":"4460234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4460246,"authors":[{"name":"Xinyu Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xinyu","lastName":"Xu","id":"37276823600"},{"name":"Ashwin M Khambadkone","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ashwin M","lastName":"Khambadkone","id":"37274643100"},{"name":"Ramesh Oruganti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ramesh","lastName":"Oruganti","id":"37275294800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0783-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"4460246","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":687},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bidirectional control","DC-DC power converters","Field programmable gate arrays","Digital control","Automotive applications","Power system modeling","Inductors","Topology","Zero voltage switching","Control design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automotive electronics","closed loop systems","DC-DC power convertors","digital control","field programmable gate arrays","PI control","switching convertors","zero voltage switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft-switched back-to-back bidirectional dc/dc converter","FPGA based digital control","close loop control design","zero-voltage-switching","soft switching","switching power losses","digital PI controller"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Soft-Switched Back-to-Back Bi-directional DC/DC Converter with a FPGA based Digital Control for Automotive applications","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2007.4460246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459874","endPage":"267","publicationTitle":"IECON 2007 - 33rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2007 - 33rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4459873/4459874/04460246.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2007.4460246","startPage":"262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4460246","abstract":"The paper proposes a soft-switch back-to-back bi-directional DC/DC converter. There is no input inductor in this topology in both the step-down and step-up mode, as a result, there is no RHP zero in the system model and hence the converter always functions as a minimum phase system. This makes the converter a first-order system, and the close loop control design becomes easy. The removal of the inductor reduces power loss during the operation. Moreover, soft switching using zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) reduces switching power losses. The proposed topology achieves high efficiency and high power density. The paper describes the analysis and design for the converter system under non-ideal conditions. The possible ZVS range of the load variation is also given. A large signal average model and a small signal model for the bi-directional converter are derived. Based on the system model, a digital PI controller is designed and is implemented by using an FPGA. Closed loop control and variable load operating performance are experimentally validated on a 100 W prototype converter. A maximum efficiency of 92.3% is achieved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460246/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2008","accessionNumber":"9827767","htmlLink":"/document/4460246/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Soft-Switched Back-to-Back Bi-directional DC/DC Converter with a FPGA based Digital Control for Automotive applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Soft-Switched Back-to-Back Bi-directional DC/DC Converter with a FPGA based Digital Control for Automotive applications","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IECON07-00-372.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056845S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4459873","isNumber":"4459874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4459873","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4459874","articleId":"4460246","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4460261,"authors":[{"name":"Byoung-Suk Choi","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byoung-Suk","lastName":"Choi","id":"37537258600"},{"name":"Ju-Jang Lee","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ju-Jang","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280306200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0783-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"4460261","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"abstract":"Localization is most important and necessary technology for mobile robot to work well.

Measurement results are included to prove that the proposed concept leads to good results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Current Sensor Fault Detection, Identification, and Reconfiguration for Doubly Fed Induction Generators","publicationTitle":"IECON 2007 - 33rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2007.4460306","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2007 - 33rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4459873/4459874/04460306.pdf","startPage":"1115","endPage":"1120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2007.4460306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459874","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4460306","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460306/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Current Sensor Fault Detection, Identification, and Reconfiguration for Doubly Fed Induction Generators","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4460306/","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9827827","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current Sensor Fault Detection, Identification, and Reconfiguration for Doubly Fed Induction Generators","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IECON07-00-432.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065209S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4459873","isNumber":"4459874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4459873","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4459874","articleId":"4460306","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4460322,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The controller is a combination of three sub-controllers, one for each of the d-axis, q-axis and zero-sequence components of the converter dynamic model In the proposed control strategy, the zero-sequence and the q-axis sub-controllers are inner loop controllers, whereas the d-axis sub-controller acts as an outer controller. Controller gains are selected in such a way that the zero-sequence controller is faster than the q-axis controller. Converter and AC voltage source parameters (amplitude and frequency) are assumed unknown. A robust nonlinear control law is derived from a backstepping procedure. It considerably attenuates unknown parameters effects. The advantage of the proposed design approach is its simplicity due to the fact that sub- controllers are decoupled, and gains are independently tuned. Simulation results show the effectiveness and the performance of the new robust controller.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460322/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2008","accessionNumber":"9827843","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4460322/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A New Robust Controller for a Three-Phase Three-Level NPC Rectifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Robust Controller for a Three-Phase Three-Level NPC Rectifier","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IECON07-00-448.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045045S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4459873","isNumber":"4459874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4459873","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4459874","articleId":"4460322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4460323,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Presently, most of the studies of rule extraction from trained neural networks focus on extracting rule from existing neural network models that were designed without the consideration of rule extraction, hence after the training process they are meant to be used as a kind black box. Consequently, this makes rule extraction a hard task. In this study we construct a model of neural network ensemble with the consideration of rule extraction. The function of the ensemble can be easily interpreted to generate logical rules that are understandable for human. We believe that the interpretability of neural networks contributes to the improvement of the reliability and the usability of neural networks when applied to critical real world problems.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2007.4460332","startPage":"228","endPage":"232","publicationTitle":"IECON 2007 - 33rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2007.4460332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459874","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2007 - 33rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4459873/4459874/04460332.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Interpretable Neural Network Ensemble","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460332/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Interpretable Neural Network Ensemble","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4460332/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9827853","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2008","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Interpretable Neural Network Ensemble","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IECON07-00-458.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070891S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4459873","isNumber":"4459874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4459873","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4459874","articleId":"4460332","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4460333,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Xue","affiliation":["Wuhan University of Science and Engineering, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Xue","id":"37577334400"},{"name":"Yuchuan Wu","affiliation":["Wuhan University of Science and Engineering, China"],"firstName":"Yuchuan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37084854400"},{"name":"Haixia Zhang","affiliation":["Wuhan University of Science and Engineering, China"],"firstName":"Haixia","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38130045000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0783-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"4460333","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":443},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4460333","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation inverters","Current control","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Voltage control","Pulse width modulation","Filters","Error correction","Inductance","Robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","electric current control","predictive control","PWM invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive predictive current-controlled PWM strategy","single-phase grid-connected inverters","current-regulated inverters","ramp comparison","hysteresis control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IECON.2007.4460333","publicationTitle":"IECON 2007 - 33rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2007 - 33rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4459873/4459874/04460333.pdf","startPage":"1548","endPage":"1552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2007.4460333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459874","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Predictive Current-Controlled PWM Strategy for Single-Phase Grid-Connected Inverters","abstract":"The three major approaches for current-regulated inverters are ramp comparison, hysteresis control, and predictive current control.

An active clamp circuit based on two clamp switches and one clamp capacitor are used to recycle the energy stored in the transformer leakage inductor to minimize the spike voltage at the transformer primary side and reduce the voltage stress of switching devices. The resonant behavior based on the output capacitance and leakage inductance of the transformer during the transition interval between the main and clamp switches in the proposed converter is used to achieve ZVS operation of main switching devices. The duty ratio of main switching devices in the proposed converter can be more than 50% of the conventional forward converter. In the output stage of the proposed converter, the CDR circuit offers the ripple current cancellation at the output capacitor and reduces the current stress of transformer secondary winding. The winding turn of the current doubler rectifier is also reduced compared with the winding turn of the center-tapped rectifier. The circuit configuration and the principle of operation are analyzed and discussed. The design considerations of the proposed converter are provided.

MSPWMs have been shown to exhibit a drastically lower phase lag with respect to their single-sampled counterparts, thus allowing for higher closed-loop bandwidths to be achieved. However the increased sampling frequency gives rise to nonlinear phenomena called sampling-induced dead bands that negatively affect the system operation, as they introduce zero- differential gain regions in the modulator trans characteristic. This paper proposes a correction algorithm that allows for dead-band removal, thus making the PWM gain constant with respect to the imposed modulating signal. This result is achieved by a simple solution that can be easily implemented without specific hardware requirements. Simulation and experimental results on a dc-dc synchronous buck converter are provided to show the effectiveness and overall simplicity of the proposed solution.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459874","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2007.4460373","publicationTitle":"IECON 2007 - 33rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2007 - 33rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4459873/4459874/04460373.pdf","startPage":"1495","endPage":"1500","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2007.4460373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elimination of Sampling-Induced Dead Bands in Multiple-Sampled Pulse Width Modulators for DC-DC Converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Elimination of Sampling-Induced Dead Bands in Multiple-Sampled Pulse Width Modulators for DC-DC Converters","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4460373/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9827894","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460373/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elimination of Sampling-Induced Dead Bands in Multiple-Sampled Pulse Width Modulators for DC-DC Converters","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IECON07-00-499.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05097S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4459873","isNumber":"4459874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4459873","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4459874","articleId":"4460373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4460387,"authors":[{"name":"Chieh-Lun Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chieh-Lun","lastName":"Lu","id":"37406438900"},{"name":"Li-Chen Fu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Li-Chen","lastName":"Fu","id":"37278448600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0783-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"4460387","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":156},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Image processing","Pipelines","Computer architecture","Delay","Robots","Application software","Timing","Field programmable gate arrays","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware architecture","Multilayer Image Processing","CPU-based computing system","timing delay","resource grabbing","data flow","pipeline properties","visual pipeline","FPGA","multiscale Harris corner detector"]}],"abstract":"Visual data with appropriate processing has very important information for many robotic applications. Usually, people use digital computer to do the image processing, but for complex or copious algorithms, due to the architecture of present CPU-based computing system, it is very time consuming and resource wasting to do these kinds of process. In this paper, we focus on the crucial case - image algorithms with multi-layer processes. In this kind of algorithms, the following process always need to wait the result from the previous step and access the memory very frequently, which cause the timing delay and resource grabbing in general CPU-based system. In order to solve this problem, first we go deep into the data flow in multi-layer image processing. We observe that it has many parallel and pipeline properties without waiting for some unnecessary delay, and fortunately, these properties exactly match with the characteristics of hardware design. For this reason, we propose a novel hardware architecture called visual pipeline to overcome these problems. The combination of the concepts from parallel and pipeline properties in hardware design are used, and finally we use FPGA to implement our architecture. To verify our hardware design, we use multi-scale Harris corner detector as the example, which is also a multi-layer process. Finally, we can show the result running in real-time of multi-layer image processing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware Architecture to Realize Multi-layer Image Processing in Real-time","publicationTitle":"IECON 2007 - 33rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2007.4460387","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2007 - 33rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4459873/4459874/04460387.pdf","startPage":"2478","endPage":"2483","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2007.4460387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459874","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4460387","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460387/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Hardware Architecture to Realize Multi-layer Image Processing in Real-time","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4460387/","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9827908","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware Architecture to Realize Multi-layer Image Processing in Real-time","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IECON07-00-513.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115338S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4459873","isNumber":"4459874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4459873","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4459874","articleId":"4460387","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4460391,"authors":[{"name":"Rachana A Gupta","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Rachana A","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37288191400"},{"name":"Mo-Yuen Chow","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Mo-Yuen","lastName":"Chow","id":"37270002500"},{"name":"Avesh Kumar Agarwal","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Avesh Kumar","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37399283200"},{"name":"Wenye Wang","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Wenye","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280459500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0783-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"4460391","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":504},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Information security","Next generation networking","Communication system security","Actuators","Space technology","Data security","Cryptography","Intelligent robots","Intelligent sensors","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptographic protocols","distributed control","navigation","radio networks","real-time systems","robots","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed network-control-system","real-time application","information security","network security protocol","encryption scheme","wireless network","robot navigation path tracking system","statistical approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed networked-control-system","iSpace","data-sensitive wireless network","data security"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4460391","abstract":"Distributed network-control-systems (D-NCS) are a multidisciplinary effort whose aim is to produce a network structure and components that are capable of integrating sensors, actuators, communication, and control algorithms in a manner to suit real-time applications.

We define performance parameters for this NCS test bed. Various system factors affecting these performance parameters are recognized. Network security algorithms DES and 3DES are integrated with the application to encrypt the sensitive information flow. These wireless security features are considered as an added factor to the NCS.

However, delays in the development of this standard (which began in 2003, and is still in the final draft stages) as well as vendor, customer reluctance to adopt the pre-11n offerings in the marketplace, have generally slowed interest in this next-generation technology. However, there is still much to be excited about. The latest draft of IEEE 802.11n (Draft 3.0) offers the potential of throughputs beyond 200 Mbps, based on physical layer (PHY) data rates up to 600 Mbps. This is achieved through the use of multiple transmit and receive antennas, referred to as MIMO (multiple input, multiple output). Using techniques such as spatial division multiplexing (SDM), transmitter beamforming, and space-time block coding (STBC), MIMO is used to increase dramatically throughput over single antenna systems (by two to four times) or to improve range of reception, depending on the environment. This article offers an exposition on the techniques used in IEEE 802.11n to achieve the above improvements to throughput and range. First, the current generation WLAN devices (11a/b/g) are described in terms of the benefits offered to end users. Next, the evolution of the Tin amendment is discussed, describing the main proposals given, and illustrating reasons for the delay in standardization. Then, the changes to the PHY for 11n are presented. A description of channel modeling with MIMO is shown, followed by the signal processing techniques employed, including MIMO channel estimation and detection, space-time block coding (STBC), and transmitter beamforming. Simulation results are presented which illustrate the benefits of these techniques, versus the existing a/g structures, for both throughput and range. Finally, a brief section outlining considerations for the rapid prototyping of a baseband design based on the 802.11n PHY is presented. We conclude with a discussion of the future for 11n, describing the issues addressed with Drafts 2.0 and 3.0, as well as its place in a wireless market with WiMAX and Bluetooth.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless LAN Comes of Age: Understanding the IEEE 802.11n Amendment","publicationTitle":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCAS.2008.915504","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/7384/4459450/04460436.pdf","startPage":"28","endPage":"54","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCAS.2008.915504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459450","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4460436","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460436/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"First Quarter  2008","displayDocTitle":"Wireless LAN Comes of Age: Understanding the IEEE 802.11n Amendment","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4460436/","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2008","publicationDate":"First Quarter 2008","accessionNumber":"9907930","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless LAN Comes of Age: Understanding the IEEE 802.11n Amendment","sourcePdf":"12008-Thomas-20.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08582S","chronDate":"First Quarter  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7384","isNumber":"4459450","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7384","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"4459450","articleId":"4460436","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4460480,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuo Iwama","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Sakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuo","lastName":"Iwama","id":"37293991700"},{"name":"Shuichi Miyazaki","affiliation":["Academic Center for Computing and Media Studies, Kyoto University, Sakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Shuichi","lastName":"Miyazaki","id":"37686385400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3128-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4460480","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":66,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1908},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4460480","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Samarium","Informatics","Impedance matching","Hospitals","Mathematics","Game theory","Computer science","Application software","History","Bipartite graph"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gender issues","graph theory","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stable marriage problem","output matching","bipartite graph"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["matching","stable matching","stable marriage","stable roommates"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICKS.2008.7","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Informatics Education and Research for Knowledge-Circulating Society (icks 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Informatics Education and Research for Knowledge-Circulating Society (icks 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4460449/4460450/04460480.pdf","startPage":"131","endPage":"136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICKS.2008.7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4460450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey of the Stable Marriage Problem and Its Variants","abstract":"The stable marriage problem is to find a matching between men and women, considering preference lists in which each person expresses his/her preference over the members of the opposite gender.

We explore the potential of deploying proxy caches in different autonomous systems (ASes) with the goal of reducing the cost incurred by Internet service providers and alleviating the load on the Internet backbone. We conduct an eight-month measurement study to analyze the P2P traffic characteristics that are relevant to caching, such as object popularity, popularity dynamics, and object size. Our study shows that the popularity of P2P objects can be modeled by a Mandelbrot-Zipf distribution, and that several workloads exist in P2P traffic. Guided by our findings, we develop a novel caching algorithm for P2P traffic that is based on object segmentation, and proportional partial admission and eviction of objects. Our trace-based simulations show that with a relatively small cache size, a byte hit rate of up to 35% can be achieved by our algorithm, which is close to the byte hit rate achieved by an off-line optimal algorithm with complete knowledge of future requests. Our results also show that our algorithm achieves a byte hit rate that is at least 40% more, and at most triple, the byte hit rate of the common Web caching algorithms. Furthermore, our algorithm is robust in face of aborted downloads, which is a common case in P2P systems.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2008.918081","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/4706507/04460521.pdf","startPage":"1447","endPage":"1460","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2008.918081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4706507","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic Modeling and Proportional Partial Caching for Peer-to-Peer Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460521/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Traffic Modeling and Proportional Partial Caching for Peer-to-Peer Systems","volume":"16","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10361226","htmlLink":"/document/4460521/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic Modeling and Proportional Partial Caching for Peer-to-Peer Systems","sourcePdf":"16tnet06-hefeeda.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078091S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"4706507","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"187","xplore-issue":"4706507","articleId":"4460521","onlineDate":"03 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4460526,"authors":[{"name":"Seong Soo Kim","affiliation":["Digital Media R&D Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/4542818/4460526/4460526-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seong Soo Kim received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 1989 and 1991, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Texas A&M University in 2005.","He worked in the areas of analog/digital consumer electronics and home networking as a research engineer at LG Electronics Co., Ltd., Korea, from January 1991 to August 2001.

The frequent attacks on network infrastructure, using various forms of denial of service attacks, have led to an increased need for developing techniques for analyzing network traffic. If efficient analysis tools were available, it could become possible to detect the attacks, anomalies and to take action to contain the attacks appropriately before they have had time to propagate across the network. In this paper, we suggest a technique for traffic anomaly detection based on analyzing correlation of destination IP addresses in outgoing traffic at an egress router. This address correlation data are transformed using discrete wavelet transform for effective detection of anomalies through statistical analysis. Results from trace-driven evaluation suggest that proposed approach could provide an effective means of detecting anomalies close to the source. We also present a multidimensional indicator using the correlation of port numbers and the number of flows as a means of detecting anomalies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Techniques for Detecting Traffic Anomalies Through Packet Header Data","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2007.902685","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/4542818/04460526.pdf","startPage":"562","endPage":"575","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2007.902685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4542818","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4460526","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460526/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Techniques for Detecting Traffic Anomalies Through Packet Header Data","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4460526/","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10064501","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Techniques for Detecting Traffic Anomalies Through Packet Header Data","sourcePdf":"16tnet03-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090991S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"4542818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4542818","articleId":"4460526","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4460528,"authors":[{"name":"Guoliang Xue","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Guoliang","lastName":"Xue","id":"37269674400"},{"name":"Weiyi Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND, USA"],"firstName":"Weiyi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291405700"},{"name":"Jian Tang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Montana State University, Bozemon, MT, USA"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Tang","id":"37276758700"},{"name":"Krishnaiyan Thulasiraman","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Oklahama, Norman, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Krishnaiyan","lastName":"Thulasiraman","id":"37281602900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6692"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2566"}],"articleNumber":"4460528","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":94,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":505},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Association for Computing Machinery","url":"http://www.acm.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4460528","abstract":"We study the multi-constrained quality-of-service (QoS) routing problem where one seeks to find a path from a source to a destination in the presence of K ges 2 additive end-to-end QoS constraints. This problem is NP-hard and is commonly modeled using a graph with n vertices and m edges with K additive QoS parameters associated with each edge. For the case of K = 2, the problem has been well studied, with several provably good polynomial time-approximation algorithms reported in the literature, which enforce one constraint while approximating the other. We first focus on an optimization version of the problem where we enforce the first constraint and approximate the other K - 1 constraints. We present an O(mn log log log n + mn/epsi) time (1 + epsi)(K - 1)-approximation algorithm and an O(mn log log log n + m(n/epsi)\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K-1</sup>\n) time (1 + epsi)-approximation algorithm, for any epsi > 0. When K is reduced to 2, both algorithms produce an (1 + epsi)-approximation with a time complexity better than that of the best-known algorithm designed for this special case.

At the end, simulation results prove that the total number of complex multiplication in adaptive scheme is almost half of that in non-adaptive system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive fingers selection of grake receivers in MIMO-HSDPA","publicationTitle":"2008 Annual IEEE Student Paper Conference","doi":"10.1109/AISPC.2008.4460566","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Annual IEEE Student Paper Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4460535/4460536/04460566.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AISPC.2008.4460566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4460536","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4460566","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460566/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-26 Feb. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive fingers selection of grake receivers in MIMO-HSDPA","conferenceDate":"15-26 Feb. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4460566/","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2008","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9882097","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive fingers selection of grake receivers in MIMO-HSDPA","confLoc":"Aalaborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"28-PID537021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073634S","chronDate":"15-26 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4460535","isNumber":"4460536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4460535","xplore-issue":"4460536","articleId":"4460566","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4460567,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanye Wang","affiliation":["Radio Access Technology Section, Center for TeleInFrastruktur, University of Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Yuanye","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407535600"},{"name":"Muhammad Imadur Rahman","affiliation":["Radio Access Technology Section, Center for TeleInFrastruktur, University of Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Muhammad Imadur","lastName":"Rahman","id":"38184234600"},{"name":"Suvra Sekhar Das","affiliation":["Radio Access Technology Section, Center for TeleInFrastruktur, University of Aalborg, Denmark","Embedded Systems Group, Tata Consultancy Services Limited, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Suvra Sekhar","lastName":"Das","id":"37557711100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2156-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4460567","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Resource management","Niobium","Signal to noise ratio","OFDM","Throughput","Interference","Radio spectrum management","Wireless communication","Frequency conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","MIMO communication","space division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MU-MIMO based access techniques","wireless communications","user equipments","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","space division multiple access","OFDMA","SDMA"]}],"abstract":"In wireless communications, spectrum is a scarce resource that needs to be efficiently exploited so as to meet the increasing demand of different services.

However, any one architecture is rarely equally optimized for all applications. SoCs targeting a specific set of applications can greatly benefit from incorporating customized reconfigurable logic instead of generic field-programmable gate-array (FPGA) logic. Unfortunately, manually designing a domain-specific architecture for every SoC would require significant design time. Instead, this paper discusses our initial efforts towards creating a reconfigurable hardware generator capable of automatically creating flexible, yet domain-specific, designs. Our tests indicate that our generated architectures are more than 5times smaller than equivalent FPGA implementations and nearly as area-efficient as standard cell designs. We also use a novel technique employing synthetic circuit generation to demonstrate the flexibility of our architecture generation techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2007.915439","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4490005/04460576.pdf","startPage":"493","endPage":"503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2007.915439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4490005","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Design of Reconfigurable Domain-Specific Flexible Cores","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460576/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Design of Reconfigurable Domain-Specific Flexible Cores","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4460576/","accessionNumber":"9921494","volume":"16","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Design of Reconfigurable Domain-Specific Flexible Cores","sourcePdf":"16tvlsi05-compton.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091261S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4490005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4490005","articleId":"4460576","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4460584,"authors":[{"name":"Changkun Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea","Advanced Design Team, DRAM Development Division, Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., Incheon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4481203/4460584/4460584-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Changkun Park (S'03) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2001, 2003, and 2007, respectively.","In 2007, he joined the Advanced Design Team, DRAM Development Division, Hynix Semiconductor Inc., Icheon, Kyoungki-Do, Korea.

Latent semantic indexing (LSI) is a successful technology which attempts to explore the latent semantics structure in textual data, and furthermore, it reduces this large space to smaller one and provides a robust space for clustering. GA belongs to search techniques that efficiently evolve the optimal solution for the problem. Evolved in the reduced latent semantic indexing model, GA can improve clustering accuracy and speed which is typically suitable for real time clustering. We used SSTRESS criteria to analyze the dissimilarity between original term-by-document corpus matrix and the approximate decomposition matrix with different ranks corresponding to the performance of our algorithm evolved in the reduced space.

Our experiments show that a na\u00efve character bigram model of text performs as well as models generated using a state-of-the-art automatic segmenter.","displayPublicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Advanced Language Processing and Web Information Technology (ALPIT 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4460594/4460595/04460613.pdf","startPage":"45","endPage":"50","publicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Advanced Language Processing and Web Information Technology (ALPIT 2007)","doi":"10.1109/ALPIT.2007.19","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALPIT.2007.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4460595","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4460613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chinese Text Classification without Automatic Word Segmentation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Text categorization","Natural languages","Law","Legal factors","Character generation","Testing","Context modeling","Missiles","Information technology","Computer science"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chinese SegmentationText Classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460613/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Chinese Text Classification without Automatic Word Segmentation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4460613/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2008","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chinese Text Classification without Automatic Word Segmentation","confLoc":"Luoyang, China","sourcePdf":"2930a045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038437S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4460594","isNumber":"4460595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4460594","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4460595","articleId":"4460613","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4460620,"authors":[{"name":"Ding Fan","firstName":"Ding","lastName":"Fan","id":"38118032200"},{"name":"Wang Bin","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Bin","id":"38120370400"},{"name":"Wang Sili","firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Sili","id":"38127328900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-2930-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4460620","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":28},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Information retrieval","Dictionaries","Indexing","Natural languages","Information technology","Computers","Particle separators","Large-scale systems","Frequency"]}],"abstract":"In Chinese information retrieval, documents are usually segmented into words and then indexed by these words. However, segmentation granularity problem (SDP) should be considered because small granularity may lead to low precision and efficiency while big granularity may cause low recall. To solve the problem, this paper proposes an intuitive and heuristic approach. Two-level index for the segmentation dictionary is built by which the original query word could be expanded with its weighted overlaid words. This method not only reserves the advantage of big granularity in precision, but also overcome its disadvantage in recall. The experimental results show that our approach slightly but consistently outperforms the baseline.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Heuristic Approach for Segmentation Granularity Problem in Chinese Information Retrieval","publicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Advanced Language Processing and Web Information Technology (ALPIT 2007)","doi":"10.1109/ALPIT.2007.46","displayPublicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Advanced Language Processing and Web Information Technology (ALPIT 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4460594/4460595/04460620.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"91","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALPIT.2007.46","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4460595","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4460620","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460620/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Heuristic Approach for Segmentation Granularity Problem in Chinese Information Retrieval","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4460620/","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Heuristic Approach for Segmentation Granularity Problem in Chinese Information Retrieval","confLoc":"Luoyang, China","sourcePdf":"2930a087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040916S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4460594","isNumber":"4460595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4460594","xplore-issue":"4460595","articleId":"4460620","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4460644,"authors":[{"name":"Vu Hoang","affiliation":["VNU-HCM, University of Natural Sciences, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Vu","lastName":"Hoang","id":"38086773300"},{"name":"Nguyen Nguyen","affiliation":["VNU-HCM, University of Information and Technology, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Nguyen","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"38124099600"},{"name":"Dien Dinh","affiliation":["VNU-HCM, University of Natural Sciences, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Dien","lastName":"Dinh","id":"37699509500"},{"name":"Nigel Collier","affiliation":["Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Nigel","lastName":"Collier","id":"38115579400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-2930-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4460644","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":44},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diseases","Natural languages","Information filtering","Information filters","Text mining","Ontologies","Humans","Drugs","Surveillance","Marketing and sales"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we describe a topic-based Vietnamese news document filtering (VTDF) system in the BioCaster Project which automatically classifies news documents from a wide variety of sources into relevant topics suitable for disease outbreak detection.

PJVS systems use series arrays of Josephson junctions as a multibit digital-to-analog converter to produce accurate quantum-based dc voltages. Using stepwise-approximation synthesis, the system can also generate arbitrary ac waveforms [i.e., an ac programmable Josephson voltage standard (ACPJVS)] and, in this application, produces sine waves with calculable root mean square (rms) voltage and spectral content. The primary drawback to this ACPJVS synthesis technique is the uncertainty that results from switching between the discrete voltages due to finite rise times and transient signals. In this paper, we present measurements and simulations that elucidate some of the error sources that are intrinsic to the ACPJVS when used for rms measurements. In particular, we consider sine waves synthesized at frequencies up to the audio range, where the effect of these errors is more easily measured because the fixed transition time becomes a greater fraction of the time in each quantized voltage state. Our goal for the power standard is to reduce all error sources and uncertainty contributions from the PJVS-synthesized waveforms at 60 Hz to a few parts in 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">7</sup>\n so that the overall uncertainty in an ac power standard will be a few parts in 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">6</sup>\n.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2008.917260","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/4531714/04460807.pdf","startPage":"1322","endPage":"1329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2008.917260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4531714","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4460807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error and Transient Analysis of Stepwise-Approximated Sine Waves Generated by Programmable Josephson Voltage Standards","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Error and Transient Analysis of Stepwise-Approximated Sine Waves Generated by Programmable Josephson Voltage Standards","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460807/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","volume":"57","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4460807/","dateOfInsertion":"28 May 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10006686","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error and Transient Analysis of Stepwise-Approximated Sine Waves Generated by Programmable Josephson Voltage Standards","sourcePdf":"57tim07-burroughs.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07323S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"4531714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"4531714","articleId":"4460807","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4460812,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Optimal detection schemes such as maximum-likelihood (ML) detection of MIMO signals demands computational resources that are beyond the capabilities of most practical systems. Alternative reduced complexity MIMO detection techniques have been proposed, but the complexity of algorithmic schemes are in general much higher than that of the equalizer-based techniques, e.g. zero-forcing (ZF) or MMSE. On the other hand, equalizer- based techniques perform relatively poor in terms of error rate. In this paper, we propose a hybrid of an equalizer-based technique and an algorithmic search stage. Based on an error matrix and its probability density functions for different classes of error, a particular search region is selected for the algorithmic stage. As the probability of occurrence of error classes with larger search regions is small, overall complexity of the proposed technique remains low while providing a significant improvement in the error performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Australian Communications Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4457465/4460811/04460812.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2008 Australian Communications Theory Workshop","doi":"10.1109/AUSCTW.2008.4460812","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AUSCTW.2008.4460812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4460811","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4460812","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classifier based low-complexity MIMO detection for spatial multiplexing systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Detectors","Equalizers","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Computational complexity","Maximum likelihood detection","Error analysis","Slot antennas","Systems engineering and theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","error statistics","MIMO communication","multiplexing","probability","signal classification","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["classifier-based low-complexity MIMO detection","spatial multiplexing systems","equalizer-based technique","algorithmic search stage","error matrix","probability density functions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460812/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 30 2008-Feb. 1 2008","displayDocTitle":"Classifier based low-complexity MIMO detection for spatial multiplexing systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4460812/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9858756","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","conferenceDate":"30 Jan.-1 Feb. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classifier based low-complexity MIMO detection for spatial multiplexing systems","confLoc":"Christchurch, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"SPI-02282008-00001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044896S","chronDate":"Jan. 30 2008-Feb. 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4457465","isNumber":"4460811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4457465","xplore-issue":"4460811","articleId":"4460812","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4460813,"authors":[{"name":"Alan J.

As such, by leveraging prior results from random matrix theory, we can directly obtain new closed-form performance results for a wide range of co-channel interferer channel models, including unequal power, correlated Rayleigh and Rician. For the MIMO-OC system, we prove that receive correlation decreases the array gain, hence increasing the SER at high SNR.

Atmospheric turbulence causes random fluctuations in the irradiance of the received optical laser beam, commonly referred to as scintillation. The scintillation fading process is slow compared to the large data rates typical of optical transmission. As such, we adopt a quasi-static block fading model and study the outage probability of the channel under the assumption of orthogonal pulse-position modulation. Non-ideal photodetection is also assumed such that the combined shot noise and thermal noise are considered as signal-independent additive Gaussian white noise. Two channel state information (CSI) scenarios are considered: CSI at the receiver only, and CSI at both transmitter and receiver. We compute the signal-to-noise ratio exponents with receiver CSI for the cases when the scintillation is lognormal and exponential distributed, corresponding to weak and strong turbulence regimes respectively. When CSI is also known at the transmitter we show that large gains are possible by using power allocation techniques to minimise the outage probability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 30 2008-Feb. 1 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460827/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4460827/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9862961","conferenceDate":"30 Jan.-1 Feb. 2008","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Outage probability of the Gaussian free space optical channel with pulse-position modulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage probability of the Gaussian free space optical channel with pulse-position modulation","confLoc":"Christchurch, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"SPI-02282008-00016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09009S","chronDate":"Jan. 30 2008-Feb. 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4457465","isNumber":"4460811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4457465","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4460811","articleId":"4460827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4460829,"authors":[{"name":"Andre Pollok","affiliation":["Institute for Telecommunications Research, University of South Australia, Mawson Lakes, SA, Australia"],"firstName":"Andre","lastName":"Pollok","id":"37393302900"},{"name":"William G.

Non-rich scattering situations, which commonly arise at 60 GHz due to the particular propagation conditions, result in relatively high spatial correlation. Spatial multiplexing, a widely considered concept for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications, can offer large capacity gains if the spatial correlation is low. In this paper, we demonstrate that spatial multiplexing (SM) in conjunction with polarisation diversity is a viable option for 60 GHz line-of- sight (LoS) channels. The performance of the proposed scheme, which uses two antenna elements with orthogonal polarisation at each end of the transmission link, is assessed in terms of capacity. It is then compared to an optimal MIMO beamforming scheme that uses two parallel and identical antennas per link end. Furthermore, the impact of antenna misalignment is investigated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460829/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 30 2008-Feb. 1 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Jan.-1 Feb. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4460829/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9862963","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multiple-input multiple-output options for 60 GHz line-of-sight channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple-input multiple-output options for 60 GHz line-of-sight channels","confLoc":"Christchurch, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"SPI-02282008-00018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079204S","chronDate":"Jan. 30 2008-Feb. 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4457465","isNumber":"4460811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4457465","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4460811","articleId":"4460829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4460831,"authors":[{"name":"Meng Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia"],"lastName":"Meng Wang","id":"37293227400"},{"name":"Daniel E.

In the complex-baseband model, the optimization problem of tone reservation turns out to be a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), which is computationally prohibitive for a practical implementation. To address this problem, we consider the complex-valued samples of an OFDM symbol as vectors in the complex plane and develop an iterative clipping algorithm. In our approach, PAR reduction is achieved by minimizing the radius of the circle that encloses all samples, thus minimizing the maximum power peak. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve near-optimal performance with fast convergence and limited complexity.","doi":"10.1109/AUSCTW.2008.4460831","publicationTitle":"2008 Australian Communications Theory Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Australian Communications Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4457465/4460811/04460831.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AUSCTW.2008.4460831","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4460811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A complex-baseband active-set approach for tone reservation PAR reduction in OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4460831","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 30 2008-Feb. 1 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460831/","displayDocTitle":"A complex-baseband active-set approach for tone reservation PAR reduction in OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9862964","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4460831/","conferenceDate":"30 Jan.-1 Feb. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A complex-baseband active-set approach for tone reservation PAR reduction in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Christchurch, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"SPI-02282008-00020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050938S","chronDate":"Jan. 30 2008-Feb. 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4457465","isNumber":"4460811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4457465","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4460811","articleId":"4460831","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4460832,"authors":[{"name":"Ingmar Land","affiliation":["Institute for Telecommunications Research, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia","Department of Electronic Systems, University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Ingmar","lastName":"Land","id":"37283061600"},{"name":"Lars Rasmussen","affiliation":["Institute for Telecommunications Research, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Rasmussen","id":"37271341600"},{"name":"Alex Grant","affiliation":["Institute for Telecommunications Research, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Grant","id":"37272161100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2037-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2038-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4460832","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4460832","abstract":"This paper investigates the shaping of the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) functions of parallel turbo codes, when the turbo code is used as an outer code in a serially concatenated scheme.

The maximum-likelihood (ML) or sphere decoder is known to yield the lowest symbol error rate (SER). However, in the worst case, complexity is exponential in the number of antennas. Seeking to reduce complexity without greatly increasing the SER, we propose an approximate lattice decoder with polynomial arithmetic complexity. The decoder performs unconstrained nonlinear optimisation of a Jacobi theta function that approximates the log-likelihood function. Simulations demonstrate that this decoder performs nearly as well as the sphere decoder in terms of bit error rate (BER) and shows a significant performance enhancement compared to linear and lattice-reduced cancellers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximate lattice detection in MIMO communications using Jacobi theta functions","publicationTitle":"2008 Australian Communications Theory Workshop","doi":"10.1109/AUSCTW.2008.4460835","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Australian Communications Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4457465/4460811/04460835.pdf","startPage":"135","endPage":"138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AUSCTW.2008.4460835","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4460811","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4460835","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460835/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 30 2008-Feb. 1 2008","displayDocTitle":"Approximate lattice detection in MIMO communications using Jacobi theta functions","conferenceDate":"30 Jan.-1 Feb. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4460835/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9862967","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate lattice detection in MIMO communications using Jacobi theta functions","confLoc":"Christchurch, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"SPI-02282008-00024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081033S","chronDate":"Jan. 30 2008-Feb. 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4457465","isNumber":"4460811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4457465","xplore-issue":"4460811","articleId":"4460835","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4460838,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Ning","affiliation":["School of EE&T, University of New South Wales, NSW, Australia"],"lastName":"Jun Ning","id":"37971501200"},{"name":"Jinhong Yuan","affiliation":["School of EE&T, University of New South Wales, NSW, Australia"],"lastName":"Jinhong Yuan","id":"37281352700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2037-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2038-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4460838","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":289},"abstract":"In this paper we consider the design of systematic low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes using density evolution.

Using the tripartite code graph representation, we consider the degree distributions for source edges and redundancy edges separately. In particular, we discuss the necessary conditions for the two types of edges to be viewed as a single type in terms of specifying the LDPC codes properly. Then we discuss the relationship between the conventional bipartite graph representation and the tripartite graph representation. For the design of systematic LDPC codes, we show that the tripartite representation can specify the ensembles that are not available for the bipartite representation. Furthermore, we show that codes optimized by deploying the tripartite representation can achieve better performance with respect to the bipartite representation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Australian Communications Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4457465/4460811/04460838.pdf","startPage":"150","endPage":"155","publicationTitle":"2008 Australian Communications Theory Workshop","doi":"10.1109/AUSCTW.2008.4460838","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AUSCTW.2008.4460838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4460811","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4460838","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of systematic LDPC codes using density evolution based on tripartite graph","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Redundancy","Decoding","Australia","Bipartite graph","Memoryless systems","Noise level","Concatenated codes","Probability density function","Message passing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["systematic LDPC code design","density evolution","systematic low-density parity-check codes","systematic LDPC codes","tripartite graphs","tripartite code graph representation","bipartite graph representation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460838/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 30 2008-Feb. 1 2008","displayDocTitle":"Design of systematic LDPC codes using density evolution based on tripartite graph","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4460838/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9862970","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","conferenceDate":"30 Jan.-1 Feb. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of systematic LDPC codes using density evolution based on tripartite graph","confLoc":"Christchurch, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"SPI-02282008-00027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082625S","chronDate":"Jan. 30 2008-Feb. 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4457465","isNumber":"4460811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4457465","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4460811","articleId":"4460838","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4460839,"authors":[{"name":"Maurice Charbit","affiliation":["University of Adelaide, SA, Australia"],"firstName":"Maurice","lastName":"Charbit","id":"37389738300"},{"name":"Lang White","affiliation":["CNRS LTCI, UMR5141, GET-T\u00e9l\u00e9com, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Lang","lastName":"White","id":"37067203100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2037-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2038-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4460839","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":33},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Decoding","Fading","Transmitting antennas","Bit error rate","Channel estimation","Covariance matrix","Riccati equations","Receiving antennas","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","decoding","fading channels","mean square error methods","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["temporally correlated MIMO channels","temporal correlation","spatial correlation","fading channel","minimum mean-square error","PSP decoding","decoding algorithm"]}],"abstract":"It is well-known (Narula et al., 1998) that the performance of a multiple input single output (MISO) communication system can be improved if channel information is used.

Several early works have demonstrated that neural networks belonging to some classes are universal approximators of input-output deterministic functions. Recent works extend the ability of neural networks in approximating random functions using a class of networks named stochastic neural networks (SNN). In the language of system theory, the approximation of both deterministic and stochastic functions falls within the identification of nonlinear no-memory systems. However, all the results presented so far are restricted to the case of Gaussian stochastic processes (SPs) only, or to linear transformations that guarantee this property. This paper aims at investigating the ability of stochastic neural networks to approximate nonlinear input-output random transformations, thus widening the range of applicability of these networks to nonlinear systems with memory. In particular, this study shows that networks belonging to a class named non-Gaussian stochastic approximate identity neural networks (SAINNs) are capable of approximating the solutions of large classes of nonlinear random ordinary differential transformations. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated and discussed by some application examples.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2007.2000055","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4531603/04460850.pdf","startPage":"1033","endPage":"1060","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2007.2000055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4531603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Representation of Nonlinear Random Transformations by Non-Gaussian Stochastic Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Representation of Nonlinear Random Transformations by Non-Gaussian Stochastic Neural Networks","volume":"19","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 May 2008","accessionNumber":"9999721","pubMedId":"18541503","publicationDate":"June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4460850/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Representation of Nonlinear Random Transformations by Non-Gaussian Stochastic Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"19tnn06-crippa.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102997S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4531603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4531603","articleId":"4460850","onlineDate":"05 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4460868,"authors":[{"name":"Ira O.

To compactly connect the transducer array with electronics, we flip-chip bond a 2D 16 times 16-element capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) array to a custom-designed integrated circuit (IC). Through-wafer interconnects are used to connect the CMUT elements on the top side of the array with flip-chip bond pads on the back side. The IC provides a 25-V pulser and a transimpedance preamplifier to each element of the array. For each of three characterized devices, the element yield is excellent (99 to 100% of the elements are functional). Center frequencies range from 2.6 MHz to 5.1 MHz. For pulse-echo operation, the average -6-dB fractional bandwidth is as high as 125%. Transmit pressures normalized to the face of the transducer are as high as 339 kPa and input-referred receiver noise is typically 1.2 to 2.1 rnPa/ radicHz. The flip-chip bonded devices were used to acquire 3D synthetic aperture images of a wire-target phantom. Combining the transducer array and IC, as shown in this paper, allows for better utilization of large arrays, improves receive sensitivity, and may lead to new imaging techniques that depend on transducer arrays that are closely coupled to IC electronics.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2008.652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4460851","startPage":"327","endPage":"342","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/4460851/04460868.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integration of 2D CMUT arrays with front-end electronics for volumetric ultrasound imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4460868/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Integration of 2D CMUT arrays with front-end electronics for volumetric ultrasound imaging","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2008","accessionNumber":"9907908","pubMedId":"18334340","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integration of 2D CMUT arrays with front-end electronics for volumetric ultrasound imaging","sourcePdf":"t0820327.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126013S","chronDate":"February  2008","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4460851","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"167","xplore-issue":"4460851","articleId":"4460868","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4460869,"authors":[{"name":"Alexia Giannoula","affiliation":["Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/4460851/4460869/4460869-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alexia Giannoula was born in 1979 in Greece.

In contrast to most other radiation force-based methods, these shear waves can be narrowband. Consequently, different frequency-dependent effects will not significantly affect their spectrum as they propagate within a viscoelastic medium, thereby enabling the viscoelastic shear properties of the medium to be determined at any given modulation frequency. This can be achieved by tracking the shear wave phase delay and change in amplitude over a specific distance. In this paper we explore the properties of short duration (dynamic) low-frequency shear wave propagation and study how the shear displacement field depends on the excitation conditions. Our investigations make use of the approximate Green's functions for viscoelastic media, and the evolution of such waves is studied in the spatioternporal domain from a theoretical perspective. Although nonlinearities are included in our confocal source model, just the properties of the fundamental shear component are examined in this paper. We examine how the shear wave propagation is affected by the shear viscosity, the coupling wave, the spatial distribution of the force, the shear speed, and the duration of the modulated wave. A method is proposed for estimating the shear viscosity of a viscoelastic medium. In addition, it is shown how the Voigt model parameters can be extracted from the frequency-dependent speed and attenuation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460869/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4460869/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","publicationDate":"February 2008","accessionNumber":"9907909","pubMedId":"18334341","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Narrowband shear wave generation by a finite-amplitude radiation force: The fundamental component","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Narrowband shear wave generation by a finite-amplitude radiation force: The fundamental component","sourcePdf":"t0820343.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069088S","chronDate":"February  2008","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4460851","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4460851","articleId":"4460869","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4460870,"authors":[{"name":"Sai Chun Tang","affiliation":["Harvard Med.

A switching waveform without the third harmonic was created by cascading two switched-mode power inverter modules at which their output waveforms were pi/3 phase-shifted from each other. A PSPICE simulation model for the power converter output stage was developed. The simulated results were in good agreement with the measurement. The waveform and harmonic contents of the acoustic pressure generated by a 1-MHz, self-focused piezoelectric transducer with and without harmonic cancellation have been evaluated. Measured results indicated that the acoustic third harmonic- to-fundamental ratio at the focus was small (-48 dB) with harmonic cancellation, compared to that without harmonic cancellation ( -20 dB). The measured acoustic levels of the fifth harmonic for both cases with and without harmonic cancellation also were small (-46 dB) compared to the fundamental.

Moreover, an integrated algorithm combined by the filtering strategy, maximally stable extremal region (MSER) and scale invariant feature transform, is introduced for affine invariant feature extraction. Since Mikolajczyk et al. identified that MSER is the best detector in many cases, we design an experiment to compare our approach (ED-MSER) with the standard MSER.

This typically requires a multiclass analysis be broken down into a series of binary classifications, following either the one-against-one or one-against-all strategies. However, the binary SVM can be extended for a one-shot multiclass classification needing a single optimization operation. Here, an approach for one-shot multi- class classification of multispectral data was evaluated against approaches based on binary SVM for a set of five-class classifications. The one-shot multiclass classification was more accurate (92.00%) than the approaches based on a series of binary classifications (89.22% and 91.33%). Additionally, the one-shot multi- class SVM had other advantages relative to the binary SVM-based approaches, notably the need to be optimized only once for the parameters C and 7 as opposed to five times for one-against-all and ten times for the one-against-one approach, respectively, and used fewer support vectors, 215 as compared to 243 and 246 for the binary based approaches. Similar trends were also apparent in results of analyses of a data set of larger dimensionality. It was also apparent that the conventional one-against-all strategy could not be guaranteed to yield a complete confusion matrix that can greatly limit the assessment and later use of a classification derived by that method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460898/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","volume":"5","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9976170","dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4460898/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multiclass and Binary SVM Classification: Implications for Training and Classification Users","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiclass and Binary SVM Classification: Implications for Training and Classification Users","sourcePdf":"05lgrs02-mathur.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116212S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"4481081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"161","xplore-issue":"4481081","articleId":"4460898","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4460902,"authors":[{"name":"Ana V\u00c1zquez Alejos","affiliation":["Departamento de Teor\u00eda do Sinal e Comunicaci\u00f3ns, Universidade de Vigo, Vigo, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4665392/4460902/4460902-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ana V\u00e1zquez Alejos was born in Caracas, Venezuela, in 1972.

Site-shielding techniques appear as a method of improving millimeter-wave wireless communication system design, allowing frequency reuse and reducing cochannel interference. The viability of applying such techniques to systems operating in frequency bands around 40 GHz is the aim of this paper. Several propagation mechanisms are experimentally studied, including transmission across building obstacles, depolarization, reflection, and diffraction. The performance of some theoretical models of the different scattering mechanisms has been compared with measurement results. The measuring and processing procedures have also been improved. Values of the dielectric parameters of the materials in this frequency band have been obtained and are given in this paper. The attenuation results indicate that various materials, such as mortar, brick, and concrete walls, that present large values of attenuation in decibels per centimeter, can be used to shield base stations, reducing the frequency reuse distance in radio cellular networks. It can also be concluded that there is a significant diffracted field in the shadow region of brick corners.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.920052","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4665392/04460902.pdf","startPage":"3369","endPage":"3380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4665392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.920052","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement and Analysis of Propagation Mechanisms at 40 GHz: Viability of Site Shielding Forced by Obstacles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4460902","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Measurement and Analysis of Propagation Mechanisms at 40 GHz: Viability of Site Shielding Forced by Obstacles","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460902/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10312128","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4460902/","volume":"57","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement and Analysis of Propagation Mechanisms at 40 GHz: Viability of Site Shielding Forced by Obstacles","sourcePdf":"57tvt06-alejos.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082212S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4665392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"4665392","articleId":"4460902","onlineDate":"05 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4460905,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaozhou Huang","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Inc., Germantown, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaozhou","lastName":"Huang","id":"37293560000"},{"name":"Hsiao-Chun Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Hsiao-Chun","lastName":"Wu","id":"37292236100"},{"name":"Yiyan Wu","affiliation":["Communications Rcscarch Centre, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Yiyan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281231400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4460905","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":438},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4460905","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM modulation","Wireless sensor networks","Bit error rate","Frequency division multiplexing","Multimedia communication","Digital video broadcasting","Digital audio broadcasting","Broadcast technology","Metropolitan area networks","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","channel estimation","encoding","error statistics","intercarrier interference","OFDM modulation","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot-free adaptive modulation","wireless OFDM systems","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","ubiquitous contemporary technology","digital audio/video broadcasting","wireless local networks","metropolitan area networks","wireless multimedia services","quality-of- service","OFDM systems","polynomial cancellation coding methods","crucial intercarrier interference problem","channel quality","signal-to-noise ratio","overhead pilot symbols","Monte Carlo simulations","bit-error-rate","BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive modulation","fading channels","intercarrier interference (ICI) self-cancellation","kurtosis measurement","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","polynomial cancellation coding (PCC)","signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimation"]},{"kwd":["OFDM","Adaptive Modulation","Polynomial Cancellation Coding","ICI Self-cancellation","Fading Channels","Kurtosis Measurement","SNR Estimation"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is the ubiquitous contemporary technology adopted for digital audio/video broadcasting, as well as wireless local and metropolitan area networks. Since the wireless multimedia services often have different quality-of- service requirements and their performance is sensitive to the channel conditions, the conventional fixed OFDM modulation scheme might not be a satisfactory solution nowadays. In this paper, we introduce a novel pilot-free adaptive modulation scheme, which is bandwidth efficient and allows variable data rates, for the future robust OFDM systems. We design a number of modulation modes in a combination of different constellation sizes and different polynomial cancellation coding (PCC) methods to combat the crucial intercarrier interference (ICI) problem. Instead of estimating the channel quality based on the overhead pilot symbols, we propose to directly estimate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) free of using any pilot. Moreover, our scheme offers more modulation modes than some other existing adaptive modulation methods, which are simply based on different constellation sizes. According to the Monte Carlo simulations, the empirical results show that our adaptive modulation scheme, in most channel conditions (SNR ges 13 dB), not only can satisfy the predetermined bit-error-rate (BER) requirement (BER les 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-4</sup>\n) but also can dynamically enhance the throughputs in the rather clean environments with high SNR values.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.919926","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.919926","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4665392/04460905.pdf","startPage":"3863","endPage":"3867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4665392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Pilot-Free Adaptive Modulation for Wireless OFDM Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460905/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Novel Pilot-Free Adaptive Modulation for Wireless OFDM Systems","volume":"57","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10312150","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Pilot-Free Adaptive Modulation for Wireless OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"57tvt06-huang-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027813S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","isNumber":"4665392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"23","articleId":"4460905","onlineDate":"05 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4460908,"authors":[{"name":"Zhipeng Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4665392/4460908/4460908-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhipeng Wang received the B.Sc. degree in electronics and information systems and the M.Sc. degree in computer communication networks from the Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 1995 and 1998, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in wireless communications from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, in 2006.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow with the School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.

By considering a fixed channel reservation (FCR) scheme as a benchmark, an efficient and accurate analytical approach is developed for obtaining the performance of multiparty traffic under various quality-of-service (QoS) performance measure criteria. The proposed approach is based on a Markovian queuing model, and its correctness and accuracy have been verified by means of computer simulations. To improve the overall performance of LEO-MSS, two novel resource management techniques are introduced and analyzed. The first one is an efficient adaptive channel reservation (ACR) scheme, which allows priority to be given to handover requests that are generated by multiparty traffic. The second one is a new call queuing (NCQ) policy, which efficiently reduces the new call blocking probability with little impact on other system performance measures, such as call dropping probability and unsuccessful call probability. Various performance results show that when ACR is used in conjunction with NCQ, extremely low blocking and handover failure probabilities can be achieved for multiparty traffic.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4665392/04460908.pdf","startPage":"3832","endPage":"3842","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.919979","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.919979","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4665392","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4460908","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis and Improvement Methods for Channel Resource Management Strategies of LEO\u2013MSS With Multiparty Traffic","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Resource management","Low earth orbit satellites","Satellite broadcasting","Traffic control","Application software","Extraterrestrial measurements","Multimedia systems","Quality of service","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","Markov processes","mobile satellite communication","queueing theory","resource allocation","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel resource management strategy","multiparty traffic","low Earth orbit mobile satellite system","fixed channel reservation scheme","quality-of-service performance","Markovian queuing model","computer simulation","adaptive channel reservation scheme","new call queuing policy","call blocking probability","call dropping probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel resource management","fixed channel reservation (FCR)","handover","low Earth orbit (LEO)","mobile satellite systems (MSSs)","multiparty"]},{"kwd":["Channel Resource Management","Fixed Channel Reservation","Handover","Multi-party","Low Earth Orbit","Mobile Satellite Systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460908/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis and Improvement Methods for Channel Resource Management Strategies of LEO\u2013MSS With Multiparty Traffic","volume":"57","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4460908/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10312185","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis and Improvement Methods for Channel Resource Management Strategies of LEO\u2013MSS With Multiparty Traffic","sourcePdf":"57tvt06-zwang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06331S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4665392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4665392","articleId":"4460908","onlineDate":"05 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4460909,"authors":[{"name":"Lili Zhong","affiliation":["Sugar Land Product Center, Schlumberger Oil Field Services, Sugar Land, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4475343/4460909/4460909-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lili Zhong received the B.S. degree in biomedical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2000, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Houston, Houston, TX, in 2005.","She is currently an Engineer with the Sugar Land Product Center, Schlumberger Oil Field Services, Sugar Land, TX.

To make the inversion process reasonably fast, a fast forward method must be developed. Numerical methods, such as the finite element method and finite difference method, are flexible but slow for inversion purposes. In this paper, an analytic method is developed to simulate induction tools in deviated wells drilled in anisotropic formations. This method can be applied to the triaxial induction tools with transmitting and receiving coils oriented in three mutually perpendicular directions. The axis of the tool may intercept a formation with dip, azimuthal, and orientation angles. Formulations of the electromagnetic fields generated by these three transmitting coils are derived. The derivation uses the coefficient propagator method with the assumption of negligible borehole effect and invasion zones. This method overcomes the problem of numerical overflow without compromising the accuracy of the solution. Because the new induction tool has three transmitting and three receiving coils, a total of nine logs are obtained at each logging depth compared with one or two logs in regular induction or logging while drilling tools.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2008.915749","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4475343/04460909.pdf","startPage":"1148","endPage":"1163","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.915749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computation of Triaxial Induction Logging Tools in Layered Anisotropic Dipping Formations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4460909","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4460909/","displayDocTitle":"Computation of Triaxial Induction Logging Tools in Layered Anisotropic Dipping Formations","volume":"46","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920370","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4460909/","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computation of Triaxial Induction Logging Tools in Layered Anisotropic Dipping Formations","sourcePdf":"46tgrs04-zhong-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.167732S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4475343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"4475343","articleId":"4460909","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4461626,"authors":[{"name":"Joao Viana Fonseca","firstName":"Joao","lastName":"Viana Fonseca","id":"37087468446"},{"name":"Ivanildo Silva Abreu","firstName":"Ivanildo","lastName":"Silva Abreu","id":"37087469187"},{"name":"Patricia Helena Moraes Rego","firstName":"Patricia Helena","lastName":"Moraes Rego","id":"37087465873"},{"name":"Marlon de Paulo Melo Wolff","firstName":"Marlon de Paulo","lastName":"Melo Wolff","id":"37087470183"},{"name":"Orlando Fonseca Silva","firstName":"Orlando Fonseca","lastName":"Silva","id":"37087471384"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-0992"}],"articleNumber":"4461626","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":653},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Region 9","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/reg/9/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4461626","abstract":"In this article, models and a genetic algorithm convergence analysis method for the LQR weight matrices determination are presented.

Tests for the genetic search models performance evaluation and for the control law efficiency are conducted with a 6th order dynamic model representing an aircraft.","doi":"10.1109/TLA.2008.4461626","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Latin America Transactions","pdfPath":"/iel5/9907/4461625/04461626.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Latin America Transactions","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TLA.2008.4461626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4461625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm Convergence and Models for Eigenstructure Assignment via Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Regulators","Optimal control","Algorithm design and analysis","Control systems","Proposals","Convergence","Performance analysis","Testing","Aircraft"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","genetic algorithms","linear quadratic control","matrix algebra","multivariable control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm convergence","eigenstructure assignment","linear quadratic regulator","eigenstructures allocation","multivariable dynamic systems","optimal control","fitness function metrics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["convergence analysis","Eigenstructure assignment","genetic algorithm","linear quadratic regulator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4461626/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm Convergence and Models for Eigenstructure Assignment via Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)","volume":"6","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","accessionNumber":"10206036","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Genetic Algorithm Convergence and Models for Eigenstructure Assignment via Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)","sourcePdf":"6TLA1_01VianaFonsecaNeto.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036837S","chronDate":"March  2008","isNumber":"4461625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9907","citationCount":"5","articleId":"4461626","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4461638,"authors":[{"name":"Sarita Mazzini Bruschi","affiliation":["Instituto de Ci\u00eancias Matem\u00e1ticas e de Computa\u00e7\u00e3o, Universidade de S\u00e1o Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Sarita","lastName":"Mazzini Bruschi","id":"37087980260"},{"name":"Rodrigo Fernandes de Mello","affiliation":["Instituto de Ci\u00eancias Matem\u00e1ticas e de Computa\u00e7\u00e3o, Universidade de S\u00e1o Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Rodrigo","lastName":"Fernandes de Mello","id":"37087036104"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-0992"}],"articleNumber":"4461638","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":323},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Region 9","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/reg/9/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4461638","abstract":"This paper presents a method to partition models in logical processes in the context of distributed simulation.

Since neural preamplifiers usually exhibit high-pass filtering at frequencies as low as 0.1 Hz, the recovery from saturation is typically very slow. Consequently, following stimulation, no signal can be detected for up to several seconds. This is unacceptably slow response of the preamplifier because the majority of neurons fires action potentials within first milliseconds following stimulation. Here we propose to use a switched-capacitor preamplifier with adjustable pass-band for fast recovery from saturation caused by stimulation via the recording electrode. The idea was tested in a real preamplifier manufactured with a standard CMOS technology (0.35 mum).

The ECG beat signals are first decomposed into components in different subbands using discrete wavelet transformation. Three statistical features of each decomposed subband signals as well as the AC power and instantaneous RR interval of the original signal are exploited to characterize the ECG signals. A PNN then follows to classify the feature vectors. The result shows that features extracted from the decomposed signals based on the two-stage two-band structure outperform the two-stage full binary structure. A promising accuracy of 99.65%, with equally well recognition rates of over 99% throughout all type of ECG beats, has been achieved using the optimal feature set.

However; this criterion is inherently prone to noise influence and does not appropriately tackle the heart sound segmentation of arrhythmic cases. A solution based upon a high frequency marker; which is extracted from heart sound using the fast wavelet decomposition, is proposed in order to estimate instantaneous heart rate. This marker is physiologically motivated by the accentuated pressure differences found across heart valves, both in native and prosthetic valves, which leads to distinct high frequency signatures of the valve closing sounds. The algorithm has been validated with heart sound samples collected from patients with mechanical and bio prosthetic heart valve implants in different locations, as well as with patients with native valves. This approach exhibits high sensitivity and specificity without being dependent on the valve type nor their implant position.

True, real-time performance will make many 3D image registration-based techniques clinically viable. Hierarchical volume subdivision-based image registration techniques are inherently faster than most elastic registration techniques, e.g. free-form deformation (FFD)-based techniques, and are more amenable for achieving real-time performance through hardware acceleration. Our group has previously reported an FPGA-based architecture for accelerating FFD-based image registration. In this article we show how our existing architecture can be adapted to support hierarchical volume subdivision-based image registration. A proof-of-concept implementation of the architecture achieved speedups of 100 for elastic registration against an optimized software implementation on a 3.2 GHz Pentium III Xeon workstation. Due to inherent parallel nature of the hierarchical volume subdivision-based image registration techniques further speedup can be achieved by using several computing modules in parallel","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2006.259498","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4028925/4461641/04462029.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2006.259498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4461641","startPage":"1425","endPage":"1428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware Implementation of Hierarchical Volume Subdivision-based Elastic Registration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4462029","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hardware Implementation of Hierarchical Volume Subdivision-based Elastic Registration","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 3 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4462029/","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9219970","pubMedId":"17946046","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/4462029/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware Implementation of Hierarchical Volume Subdivision-based Elastic Registration","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"IEMBS-00-388.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077896S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 3 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4028925","isNumber":"4461641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4028925","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4461641","articleId":"4462029","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4462100,"authors":[{"name":"J.

We used the scalogram and frequency-time based spectrum to plot the power of the wavelet transform and enhance the diagnosis features of the signal. As a result, clinical interpretation of SEMG can be improved by extracting time-based information as well as scales, which can be converted to frequencies.

These range from implants through catheters to soft contact lenses. Therefore, it is understandable that PDMS has been extensively tested for these purposes. In past years, the microfluidics has moved from predominantly silicon and glass structures towards polymers due to their ease of manufacturing and moderate cost. PDMS has gained a lot of attention in various analytical applications. However, the testing of its suitability for such applications has not been as thorough as in the biomedical applications, perhaps relying on the experiments from that field. Microfluidic PDMS structures are more and more popular in various analytical devices. Such devices consume less reagents and can work with lower sample volumes.

For example, transmitting 100 channels of neural waveform data for a cortical prosthetic control system may require up to 40 Mbps for a 100 channel array. Due to the high bandwidth required and its relative immunity from interference, optical telemetry is the most realistic method for achieving a clinically robust transcutaneous communication system capable of achieving these data rates. It is proposed that a transcutaneous optical telemetry link design can be optimized to system level design parameters (power consumption, implant location, etc.) by having a quantified understanding of the different link level design parameters (optical power, lens size, tissue effects, transmitter-receiver alignment, etc.) and an understanding as to how those parameters interact, and will allow for a design guided by an a priori assessment of these parameters. Some of these design factors and their interactions are identified and described. One of these parameters, the tissue optical spatial impulse response is measured empirically for several porcine dermal tissue configurations, and it's implications for device design tradeoffs are discussed","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2006.260398","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4028925/4461641/04462411.pdf","startPage":"2932","endPage":"2935","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2006.260398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4461641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a High Speed Transcutaneous Optical Telemetry Link","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4462411","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 3 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4462411/","displayDocTitle":"Design of a High Speed Transcutaneous Optical Telemetry Link","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9220528","pubMedId":"17946536","htmlLink":"/document/4462411/","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a High Speed Transcutaneous Optical Telemetry Link","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"IEMBS-00-770.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062203S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 3 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4028925","isNumber":"4461641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4028925","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4461641","articleId":"4462411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4462421,"authors":[{"name":"Jayant Parthasarathy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Jayant","lastName":"Parthasarathy","id":"38131897800"},{"name":"Arthur G.

In this study, ICA is used to extract important features from ECG signals. A backpropagation neural network follows to classify the input ECG beats into one of eight beat types. The independent components are calculated from the training ECG beats and serve as the ICA bases of the system. The ECG beat samples are then projected on the bases to build the ICA features for different beat types. The features based on ICA and the time interval between successive ECG beats are constituted into a feature vector and serve as inputs to the backpropagation neural network. In the study, 9800 QRS samples, including eight different ECG types, were extracted from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database for experiments. Half of the samples were used in the training phase and the other half in the testing phase. The experiments showed an impressive highest accuracy of 98.37% under the condition that only 23 independent components were used.

Typically, an equivalent circuit model is used to characterize the reactive tissue response by nonlinearly fitting the electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data. This model assumes a time invariant adjacent layer of encapsulation tissue to have the same structure on every electrode site. In this paper, an alternative approach is proposed based on modeling the encapsulation layer as a time varying communication channel. The channel is characterized by a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transfer function with time varying coefficients. This model circumvents spatial resolution limitations of existing EIS equivalent circuit models. It further allows capturing the observed changes in neural signal quality over time. We show that \"equalizing\" the channel using this model can yield a substantial improvement in signal quality. With tendency towards high-density electrode arrays for cortical implantation, the proposed model is better suited to equalize the fading channel and interpret the recorded signals with higher accuracy. We also show conceptually how patterned waveforms can periodically be used to probe the channel if adverse effects can be avoided. This can potentially improve the channel estimator performance, particularly when cell migration occurs","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2006.260055","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4028925/4461641/04462517.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2006.260055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4461641","startPage":"3357","endPage":"3360","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A MIMO channel approach for characterizing electrode-tissue interface in long-term chronic microelectrode array recordings","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4462517","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A MIMO channel approach for characterizing electrode-tissue interface in long-term chronic microelectrode array recordings","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 3 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4462517/","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9220278","pubMedId":"17946563","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/4462517/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A MIMO channel approach for characterizing electrode-tissue interface in long-term chronic microelectrode array recordings","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"IEMBS-00-876.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056798S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 3 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4028925","isNumber":"4461641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4028925","xplore-issue":"4461641","articleId":"4462517","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4462556,"authors":[{"name":"Devin B.

The models are based on the combined use of Compartmental Models (CMs) and artificial Neural Networks (NNs). Data from children with Type 1 diabetes, stored in a database, have been used as input to the models. The data are taken from four children with Type 1 diabetes and contain information about glucose levels taken from continuous glucose monitoring system, insulin intake and food intake, along with corresponding time. The influences of taken insulin on plasma insulin concentration, as well as the effect of food intake on glucose input into the blood from the gut, are estimated from the CMs. The outputs of CMs, along with previous glucose measurements, are fed to a NN, which provides short-term prediction of glucose values. For comparative reasons two different NN architectures have been tested: a Feed-Forward NN (FFNN) trained with the back-propagation algorithm with adaptive learning rate and momentum, and a Recurrent NN (RNN), trained with the Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) algorithm.

In this study, we continuously sampled the ultrasound image, SEMG signals on the extensor carpi radialis muscle together with the wrist angle simultaneously during the whole process of wrist extension and flexion from 7 normal subjects. A three-layer feed-forward artificial neural network with BP learning algorithm was used to predict the wrist angle with the muscle deformation SMG and root mean square of SEMG signals as inputs. The overall mean R value was 0.96plusmn0.02, the mean standard root mean square error was 7.26plusmn1.98, and the mean relative root mean square errors was 0.160plusmn0.037.

This investigation suggests that the GAS may provide a useful tool for ECG inverse problem studies","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2006.259672","startPage":"3907","endPage":"3910","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2006.259672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4461641","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4028925/4461641/04462653.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Use of Genetic Algorithms for Solving the Inverse Problem of Electrocardiography","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4462653/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The Use of Genetic Algorithms for Solving the Inverse Problem of Electrocardiography","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4462653/","accessionNumber":"9210794","pubMedId":"17945816","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2016","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 3 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Use of Genetic Algorithms for Solving the Inverse Problem of Electrocardiography","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"IEMBS-00-1012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044361S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 3 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4028925","isNumber":"4461641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4028925","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4461641","articleId":"4462653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4462680,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The increasing demand on the performance of medical devices requires high data rate and high power efficiency at the same time. If only one radio frequency carrier is used, it is difficult to achieve both high data rate and high power efficiency due to the competing requirements on carrier frequency and system-Q of the power and data transmission. We propose a dual band telemetry system to implement power and data transmission using different frequencies by allocating lower frequency for power transmission and higher frequency for data transmission. However, the magnetic coupling between the power carrier and data carrier will affect the operation of both links. In this paper, this interference is analyzed and design equations are derived, which are used to design coils to maximize the data signal level received at the implant side. A prototype of dual band telemetry for a retinal prosthetic device has been built and experimental results show that both power and data can be transmitted and high data rate can be achieved without compromising the power transmission efficiency","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 3 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4462775/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9220131","pubMedId":"17946243","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4462775/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Dual Band Wireless Power and Data Telemetry for Retinal Prosthesis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dual Band Wireless Power and Data Telemetry for Retinal Prosthesis","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"IEMBS-00-1134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091392S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 3 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4028925","isNumber":"4461641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4028925","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"4461641","articleId":"4462775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4462776,"authors":[{"name":"Min-Chi Hsiao","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Min-Chi","lastName":"Hsiao","id":"37422089500"},{"name":"Chiu-Hsien Chan","affiliation":["Information Sciences Institute, USC, Los Angeles, CA, USA","Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chiu-Hsien","lastName":"Chan","id":"37423393900"},{"name":"Vijay Srinivasan","affiliation":["Information Sciences Institute, USC, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Srinivasan","id":"37413256300"},{"name":"Ashish Ahuja","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, USC, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ashish","lastName":"Ahuja","id":"37560635400"},{"name":"Gopal Erinjippurath","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, USC, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Gopal","lastName":"Erinjippurath","id":"37563389300"},{"name":"Theodoros P.

We have used the hippocampal slice preparation as the first step in developing such a prosthesis. The major intrinsic circuitry of the hippocampus consists of an excitatory cascade involving the dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, and CA1 subregions; this trisynaptic circuit can be maintained in a transverse slice preparation. Our demonstration of a neural prosthesis for the hippocampal slice involves: (i) surgically removing CA3 function from the trisynaptic circuit by transecting CA3 axons, (ii) replacing biological CA3 function with a hardware VLSI (very large scale integration) model of the nonlinear dynamics of CA3, and (iii) through a specially designed multi-site electrode array, transmitting DG output to the hardware device, and routing the hardware device output to the synaptic inputs of the CA1 subregion, thus by-passing the damaged CA3. Field EPSPs were recorded from the CA1 dendritic zone in intact slices and \"hybrid\" DG-VLSI-CA1 slices. Results show excellent agreement between data from intact slices and transected slices with the hardware-substituted CA3: propagation of temporal patterns of activity from DGrarrVLSIrarrCA1 reproduces that observed experimentally in the biological DGrarrCA3rarrCA1 circuit","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4028925/4461641/04462776.pdf","startPage":"4396","endPage":"4399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2006.260138","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2006.260138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4461641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI Implementation of a Nonlinear Neuronal Model: A \"Neural Prosthesis\" to Restore Hippocampal Trisynaptic Dynamics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"VLSI Implementation of a Nonlinear Neuronal Model: A \"Neural Prosthesis\" to Restore Hippocampal Trisynaptic Dynamics","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4462776/","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4462776/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9220070","pubMedId":"17946244","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 3 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI Implementation of a Nonlinear Neuronal Model: A \"Neural Prosthesis\" to Restore Hippocampal Trisynaptic Dynamics","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"IEMBS-00-1135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082058S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 3 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4028925","isNumber":"4461641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4028925","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4461641","articleId":"4462776","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4462865,"authors":[{"name":"Scott Doyle","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Doyle","id":"37286154300"},{"name":"Carlos Rodriguez","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Rodriguez","id":"38123857300"},{"name":"Anant Madabhushi","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Anant","lastName":"Madabhushi","id":"37293992200"},{"name":"John Tomaszeweski","affiliation":["Department of Surgical Pathology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Tomaszeweski","id":"37294109500"},{"name":"Michael Feldman","affiliation":["Department of Surgical Pathology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Feldman","id":"37293991300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0032-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"4462865","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":230},"abstract":"In this paper we present a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to automatically detect prostatic adenocarcinoma from high resolution digital histopathological slides. This is especially desirable considering the large number of tissue slides that are currently analyzed manually - a laborious and time-consuming task. Our methodology is novel in that texture-based classification is performed using a hierarchical classifier within a multi-scale framework. Pyramidal decomposition is used to reduce an image into its constituent scales. The cascaded image analysis across multiple scales is similar to the manner in which pathologists analyze histopathology. Nearly 600 different image texture features at multiple orientations are extracted at every pixel at each image scale. At each image scale the classifier only analyzes those image pixels that have been determined to be tumor at the preceding lower scale. Results of quantitative evaluation on 20 patient studies indicate (1) an overall accuracy of over 90% and (2) an approximate 8-fold savings in terms of computational time. Both the AdaBoost and decision tree classifiers were considered and in both cases tumor detection sensitivity was found to be relatively constant across different scales. Detection specificity was however found to increase at higher scales reflecting the availability of additional discriminatory information","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference of

Texture Classification and Application to Early Melanoma Detection","abstract":"We have recently developed a decision support system for early skin cancer detection that relies on analysis of the pigmentation characteristics of a skin lesion, detected using crosspolarization imaging, and the increased vasculature associated with malignant lesions that is detected using transillumination imaging. Current system uses size difference based on lesion physiology and achieves great overall accuracy (86.9%). In this paper, we explore texture information, one of the criteria dermatologists use in the diagnosis of skin cancer, but has been found very difficult to utilize in an automatic manner. The overarching goal is to improve the overall decision support capability of the DSS. The objective is to use texture information ONLY to classify the benign and malignancy of the skin lesion. A three-layer mechanism that inherent to the support vector machine (SVM) methodology is employed to improve the generalization error rate and the computational efficiency. The performance of the algorithm is validated with a series of benchmark texture images and then tested on 22 pairs of real clinical skin lesion images. Our experimental results show that a 4\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup>\n-order polynomial kernel can reach an average accuracy of 70% in determining the malignancy of any pixel within any given skin lesion image.

In the proposed scheme, the spectrums of the acquired images are computed, the Fourier coefficients within a selected central window of each spectrum are extracted and fed as inputs to the neural network. The feed forward neural network is implemented to estimate the transformation, defined in terms of the translation, rotation and magnification parameters, to align the corresponding images. This approach does not estimate the various registration parameters separately. They are estimated simultaneously leading to a better-optimized set of registration parameters. The approach is successful and yields better results than another Fourier based registration technique. The approach is validated on 2D images.

This statistic is used to iteratively select the best landmark from the population. At each iteration new landmarks are created that inherit properties of the previous population of landmarks.

Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) data from the Sydney Melanoma Unit (SMU) has been used, where each patient's primary cutaneous melanoma site and corresponding sentinel lymph node locations have been recorded. Anatomically accurate finite element geometries of the skin and lymph nodes have been created using the visible human dataset. SMU's full SLNB database has been mapped from 2D onto this 3D anatomical framework via free-form deformation and projection techniques. Spatial statistical analysis and heat map displays have been calculated and visualized relating melanoma sites on the skin to sentinel lymph node fields. These detailed spatial maps provide the first anatomically accurate link between skin sites and lymphatic drainage.

The proposed method takes advantage of the fact that swallowing sounds have more non-stationarity comparing with breath sounds and have large components in many wavelet scales whereas wavelet transform coefficients of breath sounds in higher wavelet scales are small. Therefore, a wavelet transform based filter was utilized in which a multiresolution decomposition-reconstruction process filters the signal. Swallowing sounds are detected in the filtered signal. The proposed method was applied to the tracheal sound recordings of 15 healthy and 11 dysphagic subjects. The results were validated manually by visual inspection using airflow measurement and spectrogram of the sounds and auditory means. Experimental results prove that the proposed method is more accurate, efficient, and objective than the methods proposed previously.

Since many of those individuals have limited or non-existing control from the neck downward, alternative hands-free input modalities have become very important for these people to access assistive devices. In hands-free control, head movement has been proved to be a very effective user interface as it can provide a comfortable, reliable and natural way to access the device. Recently, neural networks have been shown to be useful not only for real-time pattern recognition but also for creating user-adaptive models. Since multi-layer perceptron neural networks trained using standard back-propagation may cause poor generalisation, the Bayesian technique has been proposed to improve the generalisation and robustness of these networks. This paper describes the use of Bayesian neural networks in developing a hands-free wheelchair control system.

Symptoms of hypoglycemia arise from the activation of the autonomous central nervous systems and from reduced cerebral glucose consumption. HypoMon is a non-invasive monitor that measures some physiological parameters continuously to provide detection of hypoglycemic episodes in Type 1 diabetes mellitus patients (T1DM). Based on heart rate, corrected QT interval of the ECG signal and skin impedance, a neural network detection algorithm has been developed to recognize the presence of hypoglycemic episodes. From a clinical study of 21 children with T1DM, associated with hypoglycemic episodes, their heart rates increased (1.16plusmn0.16 vs. 1.03plusmn0.11, P<0.0001), their corrected QT intervals increased (1.09plusmn0.09 vs. 1.02plusmn0.07, P<0.0001) and their skin impedances reduced significantly (0.66plusmn0.19 vs. 0.82plusmn0.21, P<0.0001). The overall data were obtained and grouped into a training set, a validation set and a test set, each with 7 patients randomly selected. Using a feedforward multi-layer neural network with 9 hidden nodes, and an algorithm developed from the training set and the validation set, a sensitivity of 0.9516 and specificity of 0.4142 were achieved for the test set.

Although mathematical results conclude that guaranteeing RMS is better than PRD, clinical results have shown that the election is subordinated to the signal specific morphology","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Guarantee of Reconstruction Quality in ECG Wavelet Codecs","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2006.259420","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4028925/4461641/04463291.pdf","startPage":"6461","endPage":"6464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2006.259420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4461641","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4463291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4463291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 3 2006","displayDocTitle":"On the Guarantee of Reconstruction Quality in ECG Wavelet Codecs","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4463291/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9219953","pubMedId":"17946375","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Guarantee of Reconstruction Quality in ECG Wavelet Codecs","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"IEMBS-00-1650.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045516S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 3 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4028925","isNumber":"4461641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4028925","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4461641","articleId":"4463291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4463302,"authors":[{"name":"Pujitha Weerakoon","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Yale University, New Heaven, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Pujitha","lastName":"Weerakoon","id":"37276348000"},{"name":"Kate Klemic","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Yale University, New Heaven, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Kate","lastName":"Klemic","id":"37427503800"},{"name":"Fred J.

They exhibit several advantages compared to the traditional invasive techniques. One such technique can be based on radar principles. In this paper we scrutinize the statistical properties of a medical radar developed on a single CMOS chip, which operates in the ultra wideband from 3.1 GHz to 10.6 GHz. A key part of the chip is based on a new technique for sampling at very high frequencies called swept- threshold sampling. This is based on multiple pulse emissions, accumulation and range-gating. We derive expressions for the bias and variance of swept-threshold sampling and show that the bias is a strong function of noise power and input value, but independent of the swept-threshold parameters for a fixed input range. The variance is shown to be proportional to the quantization step size and standard deviation of the noise process. Finally, simulation results are provided as proof of concept, and they show that the derived theoretical equations for bias and mean square error are valid.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4463293","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIOCAS.2007.4463308","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4459265/4463293/04463308.pdf","startPage":"59","endPage":"62","doi":"10.1109/BIOCAS.2007.4463308","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Swept-threshold Sampling in UWB Medical Radar","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"On the Swept-threshold Sampling in UWB Medical Radar","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4463308/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9903383","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4463308/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Swept-threshold Sampling in UWB Medical Radar","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"BIOCAS-00-15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061133S","chronDate":"27-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4459265","isNumber":"4463293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4459265","xplore-issue":"4463293","articleId":"4463308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4463312,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Cassidy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Cassidy","id":"37317056200"},{"name":"Susan Denham","affiliation":["Centre for Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience University of Plymouth, Plymouth, UK"],"firstName":"Susan","lastName":"Denham","id":"37265713100"},{"name":"Patrick Kanold","affiliation":["Department of Biology, University of Maryland, MD"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Kanold","id":"37085939788"},{"name":"Andreas Andreou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Andreou","id":"37270817700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1524-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1525-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-4025"}],"articleNumber":"4463312","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":1317},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Based Silicon Spiking Neural Array","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4463312","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Silicon","Neurons","Biology computing","Very large scale integration","Neuromorphics","Biological system modeling","Costs","Computer architecture","Analog computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elemental semiconductors","field programmable gate arrays","neural chips","silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","silicon spiking neural array","neuromorphic systems","leaky integrate-and-fire artificial neurons","auditory spatio-temporal receptive fields","STRF","neural parameter optimizing algorithm","spike time dependant plasticity learning rule","STDP","Si"]}],"abstract":"Rapid design time, low cost, flexibility, digital precision, and stability are characteristics that favor FPGAs as a promising alternative to analog VLSI based approaches for designing neuromorphic systems.

Hence, it is imperative to design area and power-efficient digital circuits for appropriate conditioning of the recorded neural signal in order to remain within the bandwidth constraint. Previously, we have proposed an algorithm for neural data compression, which incorporates the concept of creating and maintaining a dynamic vocabulary of neural spike waveforms represented as wavelet transform coefficients. In this paper, we propose an appropriate architecture for low-power and area-efficient VLSI implementation of the scheme. Based on simulation results, the hardware consumes 3.55 \u03bcW and 0.36 mW power using 0.18\u03bcm CMOS technology for 1-channel and 100-channel neural recording applications, respectively.","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4459265/4463293/04463327.pdf","startPage":"134","endPage":"137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIOCAS.2007.4463327","doi":"10.1109/BIOCAS.2007.4463327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4463293","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Power VLSI Architecture for Neural Data Compression Using Vocabulary-based Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-Power VLSI Architecture for Neural Data Compression Using Vocabulary-based Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4463327/","conferenceDate":"27-30 Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4463327/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9903402","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Nov. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Power VLSI Architecture for Neural Data Compression Using Vocabulary-based Approach","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"BIOCAS-00-34.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090999S","chronDate":"27-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4459265","isNumber":"4463293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4459265","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4463293","articleId":"4463327","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4463332,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas J.

Active shielding of the high-impedance input significantly reduces noise pickup, and reduces variations in gain as a function of gap distance. The integrated sensor combines amplification, bandpass filtering, and analog-to-digital conversion within a 1 inch diameter enclosure. The measured input-referred noise, over 1-100 Hz frequency range, is 2\u03bcVrms at 0.2 mm sensor distance, and 17\u03bcVrms at 3.2 mm distance.

These energies are extractable by a modified 1-D non-recursive discrete biorthogonal wavelet transform.

environment by translating physiological signals directly acquired from the brain into commands toward external peripherals. A lot of protocols have been implemented in the BCI field and a lot of analytical techniques and algorithms on the signals have been tested to improve the reliability of the information extracted from signals and then the performances of BCI systems. Independent component analysis (ICA) revealed to be a useful tool for analyzing data as it allows the separation of the signals in some independent sources which carry information about the different components of the signals themselves. However ICA is computationally expensive and some efforts should be done in order to maximize its results in terms of time spent for the analysis. A hardware implementation is now discussed which makes the ICA more useful for the online analysis typical of BCI systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Moving Towards a Hardware Implementation of the Independent Component Analysis for Brain Computer Interfaces","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference","doi":"10.1109/BIOCAS.2007.4463350","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4459265/4463293/04463350.pdf","startPage":"227","endPage":"230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIOCAS.2007.4463350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4463293","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4463350","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4463350/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Moving Towards a Hardware Implementation of the Independent Component Analysis for Brain Computer Interfaces","conferenceDate":"27-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4463350/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9903425","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Moving Towards a Hardware Implementation of the Independent Component Analysis for Brain Computer Interfaces","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"BIOCAS-00-57.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063077S","chronDate":"27-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4459265","isNumber":"4463293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4459265","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4463293","articleId":"4463350","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4463417,"authors":[{"name":"Chris Snow","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Snow","id":"37296621000"},{"name":"Lutz Lampe","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"],"firstName":"Lutz","lastName":"Lampe","id":"37273228000"},{"name":"Robert Schober","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Schober","id":"37281221400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1462-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1463-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-2958"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-2974"}],"articleNumber":"4463417","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","WiMAX","Spectral analysis","OFDM","Communication standards","Ultra wideband technology","Wireless communication","Code standards","Viterbi algorithm","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","nonparametric statistics","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference","ultra wideband communication","Viterbi decoding","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference mitigation","coded MB-OFDM UWB","ECMA-368 MB-OFDM standard","multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","ultra wideband wireless communication","IEEE 802.16 WiMAX systems","interference spectrum estimation","Viterbi decoding","parametric spectrum estimation techniques","nonparametric spectrum estimation techniques","frequency 3.1 GHz to 10.6 GHz","frequency 3.5 GHz"]}],"abstract":"We consider the ECMA-368 Multiband Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MB-OFDM) standard for high rate Ultra Wideband (UWB) wireless communication in the 3.1- 10.6 GHz band. The performance of MB-OFDM is impacted by interference from IEEE 802.16 WiMAX systems operating in the licensed 3.5 GHz band. Motivated by recent work showing the approximately Gaussian nature of the WiMAX interference to MB-OFDM, we propose a simple two-stage interference mitigation technique for coded MB-OFDM transmissions according to the ECMA-368 standard, consisting of interference spectrum estimation during silent periods followed by appropriate bit metric weighting during Viterbi decoding. We compare parametric and non-parametric spectrum estimation techniques for coded MB-OFDM transmissions and WiMAX interference for various scenarios of interest. The proposed two-stage interference mitigation technique is shown to be highly effective at mitigating the impact of WiMAX interference.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference mitigation for coded MB-OFDM UWB","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2008.4463417","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4456902/4463396/04463417.pdf","startPage":"17","endPage":"20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2008.4463417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4463396","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4463417","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4463417/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Interference mitigation for coded MB-OFDM UWB","conferenceDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4463417/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9857185","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference mitigation for coded MB-OFDM UWB","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-02272008-00021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045828S","chronDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4456902","isNumber":"4463396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4456902","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4463396","articleId":"4463417","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4463418,"authors":[{"name":"Shreyas Sen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Shreyas","lastName":"Sen","id":"37322064300"},{"name":"Rajarajan Senguttuvan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Rajarajan","lastName":"Senguttuvan","id":"37408292800"},{"name":"Abhijit Chatterjee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Abhijit","lastName":"Chatterjee","id":"37273696200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1462-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1463-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-2958"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-2974"}],"articleNumber":"4463418","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":222},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Operational amplifiers","Power amplifiers","WiMAX","OFDM","Transmitters","Peak to average power ratio","Radiofrequency amplifiers","RF signals","Radio frequency","High power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","power amplifiers","radio transmitters","radiofrequency amplifiers","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concurrent PAR","power amplifier adaptation","power efficient operation","WiMAX OFDM transmitters","high peak-to-average ratio","linear RF power amplifier"]}],"abstract":"High peak-to-average ratio (PAR) of OFDM signals is a major bottleneck in the implementation of power efficient transmitters since the efficiency of a linear RF power amplifier reduce drastically due to backoff requirements.

Due to the non-linear characteristics of the power amplifier (PA), significant out-of- band and in-band distortions occur when high peak signals exceed the saturation level of the PA. In this paper we present a new PAPR reduction technique which exploits the use of unused- carriers as well as the phase information of pilot signals in OFDM systems to reduce the PAPR while not degrading channel estimation or frequency offset. Compared to conventional techniques such as clipping and windowing, this technique introduces much less out-of-band distortions and provides a lower bit-error-rate (BER) since there is no interference to the original data signals. There is also no requirement for side information to be transmitted to the receiver.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4456902/4463396/04463421.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"36","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2008.4463421","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2008.4463421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4463396","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4463421","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Peak to average power ratio reduction technique for OFDM using pilot tones and unused carriers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","OFDM","Nonlinear distortion","High power amplifiers","Phase distortion","Degradation","Channel estimation","Frequency estimation","Bit error rate","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","distortion","error statistics","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["peak-to-average power ratio reduction technique","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM system","power amplifier","signal distortion","channel estimation","bit-error-rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PAPR","HPA","OFDM","non-linearity","clipping"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4463421/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Peak to average power ratio reduction technique for OFDM using pilot tones and unused carriers","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4463421/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9857017","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","conferenceDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Peak to average power ratio reduction technique for OFDM using pilot tones and unused carriers","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-02272008-00025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072304S","chronDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4456902","isNumber":"4463396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4456902","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4463396","articleId":"4463421","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4463422,"authors":[{"name":"Fumiaki Maehara","affiliation":["School of Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Shinju, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Fumiaki Maehara","id":"37298056500"},{"name":"Akinori Taira","affiliation":["School of Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Shinju, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Akinori Taira","id":"37298058500"},{"name":"Fumio Takahata","affiliation":["School of Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Shinju, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Fumio Takahata","id":"37281535500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1462-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1463-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-2958"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-2974"}],"articleNumber":"4463422","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":145},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","OFDM","Fading","Nonlinear distortion","Intersymbol interference","Computer simulation","Peak to average power ratio","Performance analysis","Signal analysis","Baseband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential phase shift keying","error statistics","fading channels","intersymbol interference","quadrature phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BER performance","DQPSK","OFDM signals","comprehensive nonlinear fading channels","bit error rate","differential detection","nonlinear distortion","intersymbol interference","multipath delay"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DQPSK/OFDM","differential detection","nonlinear fading","BER","theoretical analysis"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a simple series form formula of the bit error rate (BER) for DQPSK/OFDM with differential detection under comprehensive nonlinear fading channels.

The validity of the proposed approach is confirmed by the agreement with the computer simulation results under various kinds of system parameters such as the input-backoff (IBO) and the multipath delay.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple series form formula of BER performance for DQPSK/ OFDM signals in comprehensive nonlinear fading channels","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2008.4463422","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4456902/4463396/04463422.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2008.4463422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4463396","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4463422","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4463422/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Simple series form formula of BER performance for DQPSK/ OFDM signals in comprehensive nonlinear fading channels","conferenceDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4463422/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9857092","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple series form formula of BER performance for DQPSK/ OFDM signals in comprehensive nonlinear fading channels","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-02272008-00026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049759S","chronDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4456902","isNumber":"4463396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4456902","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4463396","articleId":"4463422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4463426,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A capture model for single packet reception in a multi-carrier stabilized S-Aloha network is first proposed. This model can be effectively used for both single and multiple antenna base station (BS). A multi-packet reception model is also developed for multi-antenna base stations. In this model, the base station can use any multiuser detection algorithm. Two frame structures are used to allow multiuser detection. An ideal multiuser detector (MUD), i.e. the number of successful users is less than or equal to the number of antennas at the the BS, is considered in this paper. It is shown that for a lightly loaded system, i.e. when rate of new packet generation in the network is low, there might not be enough advantage to use a multiple antenna system in terms of throughput. It is also shown that in a finite user case the maximum attainable stabilized throughput reduces slightly with increasing number of users and very quickly reaches the infinite user case.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4463467/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4463467/","accessionNumber":"9857127","displayDocTitle":"On the use of LMMSE receiver for single and multiple packet reception in stabilized multi-channel slotted aloha","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the use of LMMSE receiver for single and multiple packet reception in stabilized multi-channel slotted aloha","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-02272008-00071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06644S","chronDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4456902","isNumber":"4463396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4456902","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4463396","articleId":"4463467","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4463476,"authors":[{"name":"Mikio Kataoka","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi and Limited, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Mikio Kataoka","id":"37824312600"},{"name":"Takashi Ishikawa","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi and Limited, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Takashi Ishikawa","id":"37832512000"},{"name":"Seishi Hanaoka","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi and Limited, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Seishi Hanaoka","id":"37840191300"},{"name":"Masashi Yano","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi and Limited, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Masashi Yano","id":"37827608900"},{"name":"Shinji Nishimura","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi and Limited, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Shinji Nishimura","id":"37396439700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1462-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1463-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-2958"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-2974"}],"articleNumber":"4463476","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Cognitive radio","Frequency","Wireless communication","Wireless LAN","Laboratories","WiMAX","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Multiaccess communication","Switching systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","IP networks","mobile radio","WiMax","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","inter base station handover","multiple wireless access","IP address","EVDO","WiMax","wireless LAN","mobile IP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Land mobile radio cellular systems","Multiaccess communication","Simulation","Switching systems","Wireless LAN"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of inter base station handover for cognitive radio","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2008.4463476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4463396","endPage":"254","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4456902/4463396/04463476.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2008.4463476","startPage":"251","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4463476","abstract":"Cognitive radio system consists of multiple wireless accesses that cover overlapping area, and cognitive terminals that use one or more of the wireless accesses simultaneously.

The intercell interference can be seen as a partial interference depend upon the on and off period of the adjacent downlink signals. So it is possible for the channel equalizer to suppress this partial intercell interference by setting the weight changes in accordance with the intercell interference.

Usually, the number of time slots of broadcast DL is more than that of communication DL. In other words, these services have different switching points between DL and UL. Therefore, time slots of communication UL could exit at the same time as those of broadcast DL. These slots are called crossed-slots. Practically, antennas for communication and broadcast are close to each other such as on the same building. That is why communication UL signals with weak power are interfered by broadcast DL signals with strong power in the crossed-slots. We have proposed a scheme which can avoid adjacent channel crossed-slot interference and can realize smooth integration of mobile communication and mobile broadcast in TD-CDMA.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4456902/4463396/04463485.pdf","startPage":"287","endPage":"290","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2008.4463485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2008.4463485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4463396","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4463485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Avoidance of adjacent channel crossed-slot interference in TD-CDMA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Broadcasting","Mobile communication","Downlink","Frequency","Communication switching","Costs","Computer science","Mobile computing","Multimedia communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjacent channel interference","code division multiple access","mobile radio","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjacent channel crossed-slot interference","TD-CDMA","mobile communication","mobile broadcast","adjacent frequency bands","uplink slots","downlink slots"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadcast","communication","crossed-slot","interference","TD-CDMA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4463485/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Avoidance of adjacent channel crossed-slot interference in TD-CDMA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4463485/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9857114","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","conferenceDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Avoidance of adjacent channel crossed-slot interference in TD-CDMA","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-02272008-00089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059306S","chronDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4456902","isNumber":"4463396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4456902","xplore-issue":"4463396","articleId":"4463485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4463488,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This is accomplished by a combination of MIMO OFDM, group coded transmit signals and antennas, array processing at the receiver for interference suppression on a per carrier basis, and a new decoding scheme. The group coding reduces the complexity of receivers in space time coded MIMO systems. It partitions transmitter antennas into small groups. The received signals are then processed by a technique called group interference suppression. By using interference suppression on a per carrier basis after the FFT at the receiver, the scheme lends itself to use on frequency selective multipath channels. Finally, a novel decoding scheme is employed. It uses samples from frequencies K/2 apart, where K is the total number of frequencies, to introduce another element of diversity, and then uses a least squares step to yield reliable statistics for symbol detection. At 22 dB, this new scheme achieves a BER of 4 x 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-5</sup>\n, without coding or interleaving.

These values are confirmed by measurements, showing the usefulness of the switch-based active device model for this type of switching-mode power amplifiers.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4463396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2008.4463519","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4456902/4463396/04463519.pdf","startPage":"423","endPage":"426","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2008.4463519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and implementation of an inverse class-F power amplifier with 79 % efficiency by using a switch-based active device model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Design and implementation of an inverse class-F power amplifier with 79 % efficiency by using a switch-based active device model","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4463519/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9857163","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4463519/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and implementation of an inverse class-F power amplifier with 79 % efficiency by using a switch-based active device model","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-02272008-00123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048085S","chronDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4456902","isNumber":"4463396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4456902","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4463396","articleId":"4463519","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4463520,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Digital TX signal is used as a reference to generate a digital IM2 signal and then is passed through the auxiliary digital filter chain as in receiver chain. Adaptive least mean square (LMS) algorithm combined with a delay estimator provides a very robust technique to act as a matched filter to estimate the channel which causes leakage from TX to RX. The delay between the receive path and the reference path is estimated by peak correlation detection. This IM2 cancellation works well even though the actual IM2 components are far below the desired signal and thermal noise.","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2008.4463543","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4456902/4463396/04463543.pdf","startPage":"519","endPage":"522","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2008.4463543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4463396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive filtering using LMS for digital TX IM2 cancellation in WCDMA receiver","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive filtering using LMS for digital TX IM2 cancellation in WCDMA receiver","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","accessionNumber":"9857143","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4463543/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4463543/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","conferenceDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive filtering using LMS for digital TX IM2 cancellation in WCDMA receiver","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-02272008-00147.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097586S","chronDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4456902","isNumber":"4463396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4456902","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4463396","articleId":"4463543","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4463546,"authors":[{"name":"Lars Thiele","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich-Hertz-Institut, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Thiele","id":"37289376400"},{"name":"Volker Jungnickel","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich-Hertz-Institut, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Volker","lastName":"Jungnickel","id":"37280807000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1462-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1463-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-2958"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-2974"}],"articleNumber":"4463546","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Interchannel interference","Physical layer","Frequency conversion","Employment","Narrowband","Feedback","Array signal processing","Base stations","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cochannel interference","frequency division multiple access","interference suppression","MIMO communication","multibeam antennas","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive MIMO transmission","realistic multicellular radio system","cochannel interference","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","multiple antennas","interference rejection","narrowband feedback channel","unitary beamforming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA","cochannel interference","array signal processing","interference suppression","adaptive transmission"]}],"abstract":"Cochannel interference in multicellular radio systems is a challenge when full area coverage needs to be ensured. On the physical layer there exist several concepts to combat the interference. However, their performance in an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system has not been thoroughly investigated yet. One promising technique is the employment of multiple antennas at the terminal side for the purpose of interference rejection. To increase the cell capacity further and under the assumption of a narrowband feedback channel, unitary beamforming can be used at the base station. We provide a performance evaluation of these techniques for an OFDMA system in the downlink and give quantitative results for the achievable capacity gains.","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2008.4463546","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4456902/4463396/04463546.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2008.4463546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4463396","startPage":"531","endPage":"534","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive MIMO transmission in a realistic multicell scenario","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4463546","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive MIMO transmission in a realistic multicell scenario","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4463546/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9857126","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4463546/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive MIMO transmission in a realistic multicell scenario","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-02272008-00150.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045848S","chronDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4456902","isNumber":"4463396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4456902","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4463396","articleId":"4463546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4463548,"authors":[{"name":"Baruch Levush","affiliation":["Naval Research Laboratory, Inc., Washington D.C., DC, USA"],"firstName":"Baruch","lastName":"Levush","id":"37273787500"},{"name":"Joe X.

This paper describes key components and parameters of this experimental system and describes the results of field experiments that show the performance gains realized by this platform.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4456902/4463396/04463568.pdf","startPage":"619","endPage":"622","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2008.4463568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2008.4463568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4463396","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4463568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Field data showing the downlink adaptive beamforming gains in an experimental IEEE 802.16e-2005 OFDMA system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Array signal processing","OFDM","Antenna arrays","Antenna measurements","Mobile antennas","Calibration","Broadband antennas","Radio frequency","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","broadband networks","frequency division multiple access","mobile radio","OFDM modulation","radio access networks","radio links","time division multiplexing","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field data","downlink adaptive beamforming gains","IEEE 802.16e-2005 OFDMA system","mobile broadband wireless access","signaling strategies","time-division duplex channel reciprocity","mobile multi-antenna OFDM system","WiMAX","TDD"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","WiMAX","IEEE 802.16","beamforming","adaptive antennas","broadband cellular"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4463568/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Field data showing the downlink adaptive beamforming gains in an experimental IEEE 802.16e-2005 OFDMA system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4463568/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9857077","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","conferenceDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Field data showing the downlink adaptive beamforming gains in an experimental IEEE 802.16e-2005 OFDMA system","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-02272008-00172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052597S","chronDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4456902","isNumber":"4463396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4456902","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4463396","articleId":"4463568","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4463570,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Xian Chang","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ming-Xian Chang","id":"37291155400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1462-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1463-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-2958"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-2974"}],"articleNumber":"4463570","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood detection","MIMO","Detection algorithms","Silicon carbide","Cost function","Maximum likelihood estimation","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","AWGN","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","transmitting antennas","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["branch-and-bound technique","MIMO communication system","maximum-likelihood detection","transmit antennas","MIMO ML detection","MMSE-based algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","maximum likelihood","branch-and-bound"]}],"abstract":"For a multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) communication system, the optimal detection is by the maximum-likelihood (ML) approach, which, however, has complexity that increases exponentially with the number of transmit antennas.

Undersampling (also named bandpass sampling) is a signal processing technique with which an RF signal is directly sampled at a rate related to its bandwidth rather than its highest frequency. In this paper, we incorporate the undersampling technique into a retrodirective antenna system, resulting in a new and simplified smart RF transceiving architecture: no analog RF mixers and local oscillators for frequency down-conversion are required. This has lead to a significant reduction in the number of the RF components required and therefore in the cost of the retrodirective system.

The adopted antenna elements are composite right/left-handed (CRLH) microstrip leaky-wave (LW) antennas for which the beam direction can be electronically scanned in a continuous manner from backfire to endfire and the beam shape can be controlled. This system offers a tremendous amount of flexibility in tuning the channel transfer matrix to increase the system performance. Based on this architecture, we propose two simple radiation pattern control algorithms. The first one requires no feedback and averages out the channel fades while the second one requires a simple feedback at the receiver to select the beam pattern maximizing the performance metric. The capacity of both algorithms is derived and analyzed using Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that these algorithms significantly improve the wireless link outage performance in a slow fading environment and increase the diversity gain of a MIMO system for a fixed multiplexing gain.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic radiation pattern diversity (DRPD) MIMO using CRLH leaky-wave antennas","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2008.4463572","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4456902/4463396/04463572.pdf","startPage":"635","endPage":"638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2008.4463572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4463396","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4463572","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4463572/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic radiation pattern diversity (DRPD) MIMO using CRLH leaky-wave antennas","conferenceDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4463572/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9857200","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic radiation pattern diversity (DRPD) MIMO using CRLH leaky-wave antennas","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-02272008-00176.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037696S","chronDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4456902","isNumber":"4463396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4456902","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4463396","articleId":"4463572","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4463573,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed M.

Active FSS elements using switched PIN diodes are discussed. The unit cell consists of a square aperture element with a metal island loading and one PIN diode placed at the upper gap considering the vertical polarization. The electromagnetic properties of the active FSS structure are changed by applying a dc bias to the substrate, and estimated by the equivalent circuit model of FSS structure and PIN diode. This active FSS design enables transmission to be switched on or off at 2.3 GHz, providing high transmission when the diodes are in off state and high isolation when the diodes are on. Equivalent circuit in the structure is investigated by analyzing transmission and reflection spectra. Measurements on active FSS are compared with numerical calculation based on the scattering matrix formalism.

This paper reviews the progress and the state-of- the-art of SICs-related research for developing low-cost high- density integration of microwave and millimeter-wave wireless devices and systems as well as microwave photonic applications. It is found that SICs may well be regarded as the next generation of high-frequency integrated circuits on the basis of their historical development path starting from the hollow rectangular waveguide. Challenging issues and future directions are discussed for research and developments, suggesting that SICs would be able to offer a potentially cost- effective and performance-promising solution for

Therefore, We have developed a 300 m leaky coaxial cable for the 2.4 GHz band and IEEE802.11b/g-complied wireless LAN units with high sensitivity for tunnels and underground facilities. We evaluated their performance with three cable configurations and confirmed that this cable provides wireless connections over 300 m.","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2008.4463585","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4456902/4463396/04463585.pdf","startPage":"687","endPage":"690","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2008.4463585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4463396","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4463585","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a 300 m 2.4 GHz frequency band leaky coaxial cable for wireless network access","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Development of a 300 m 2.4 GHz frequency band leaky coaxial cable for wireless network access","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4463585/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4463585/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9857069","conferenceDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a 300 m 2.4 GHz frequency band leaky coaxial cable for wireless network access","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-02272008-00189.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047555S","chronDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4456902","isNumber":"4463396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4456902","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4463396","articleId":"4463585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4463586,"authors":[{"name":"Umar H.

With full channel state information, it is known that multi-user transmission outperforms all other policies. With alternate channel state information available at the transmitter, it is not true that one transmission strategy always dominates the other. In particular, under some practical side information assumptions, there is instead a transition point - when the number of users is below this point, single user transmission outperforms multi-user transmission, and the reverse is true when the number of users exceeds this critical value. In this paper, we determine this mode switching point both analytically and numerically for a MIMO channel with transmit side correlation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive mode switching in the MIMO broadcast channel","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2008.4463591","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4456902/4463396/04463591.pdf","startPage":"711","endPage":"714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2008.4463591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4463396","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4463591","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4463591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive mode switching in the MIMO broadcast channel","conferenceDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4463591/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9857196","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive mode switching in the MIMO broadcast channel","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-02272008-00195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058445S","chronDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4456902","isNumber":"4463396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4456902","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4463396","articleId":"4463591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4463600,"authors":[{"name":"Song Lin","affiliation":["University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"lastName":"Song Lin","id":"37087490491"},{"name":"Aly Fathy","affiliation":["University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Aly","lastName":"Fathy","id":"37277821100"},{"name":"Gamal M.

The transmit filter baluns before the power amplifiers provide for greater than 25 db rejection of cellular frequencies below 2 GHz and transceiver spurs above 3 GHz. The RX sections provides greater than 12 db gain with 2.5 db noise figure, and superior rejection of cellular frequencies. Finally, the isolation chain to chain (RX to RX and TX to TX) is greater than 25 db which is imperative for MIMO performance.","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2008.4463629","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4456902/4463396/04463629.pdf","startPage":"863","endPage":"866","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2008.4463629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4463396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compact single band 802.11 n front-end module for MIMO applications using multi-layer organic technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4463629","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4463629/","displayDocTitle":"A compact single band 802.11 n front-end module for MIMO applications using multi-layer organic technology","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9857051","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4463629/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compact single band 802.11 n front-end module for MIMO applications using multi-layer organic technology","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-02272008-00233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044032S","chronDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4456902","isNumber":"4463396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4456902","xplore-issue":"4463396","articleId":"4463629","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4463632,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitrie C.

This is evaluated using simulations for various scenarios that include additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), multipath and/or multiple access interference, and narrowband interference. Numerical results indicate that in the presence of AWGN only, the two systems display similar performance, while for multipath propagation the TH-PAM IR system outperforms the IS-OFDM system. However, in the presence of narrowband interference the IS-OFDM system outperforms the TH-PAM IR system which displays poor performance in this case.","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2008.4463632","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4456902/4463396/04463632.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2008.4463632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4463396","startPage":"875","endPage":"878","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simulation comparison of time-hopping PAM and interference suppressing OFDM in multiuser ultra wideband communications systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4463632","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A simulation comparison of time-hopping PAM and interference suppressing OFDM in multiuser ultra wideband communications systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4463632/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9857039","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4463632/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simulation comparison of time-hopping PAM and interference suppressing OFDM in multiuser ultra wideband communications systems","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-02272008-00236.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066028S","chronDate":"22-24 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4456902","isNumber":"4463396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4456902","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4463396","articleId":"4463632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4463633,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Hu","affiliation":["Schlumberger Cambridge Research Limited, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Hu","id":"37275649300"},{"name":"Norman C.

Based on data obtained from a steady flow mock loop under a wide range of pump operating points and fluid viscosities, flow and differential pressure estimate models were thus obtained using dimensional analysis.

It explores the optimum configuration of SVM-based myoelectric control, by suggesting an advantageous data segmentation technique, feature set, model selection approach for SVM, and postprocessing methods. This work presents a method to adjust SVM parameters before classification, and examines overlapped segmentation and majority voting as two techniques to improve controller performance. A SVM, as the core of classification in myoelectric control, is compared with two commonly used classifiers: linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks. It demonstrates exceptional accuracy, robust performance, and low computational load. The entropy of the output of the classifier is also examined as an online index to evaluate the correctness of classification; this can be used by online training for long-term myoelectric control operations.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2008.919734","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4567608/04463647.pdf","startPage":"1956","endPage":"1965","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2008.919734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567608","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Support Vector Machine-Based Classification Scheme for Myoelectric Control Applied to Upper Limb","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4463647","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4463647/","displayDocTitle":"Support Vector Machine-Based Classification Scheme for Myoelectric Control Applied to Upper Limb","volume":"55","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10115007","pubMedId":"18632358","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4463647/","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Support Vector Machine-Based Classification Scheme for Myoelectric Control Applied to Upper Limb","sourcePdf":"55tbme08-oskoei.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057009S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4567608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"501","xplore-issue":"4567608","articleId":"4463647","onlineDate":"05 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":4463659,"authors":[{"name":"Kianoush Nazarpour$^\\ast$","bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/4603151/4463659/4463659-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kianoush Nazarpour (S'05) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees, both in electrical engineering from Tarbiat Modarres University, Tehran, Iran, and Khaje Nasir (KN) Toosi University of Technology, Tehran, in 2003 and 2005, respectively.

In order to reduce the computational complexity present in the estimation of the STF model using the three-way PARAFAC, the time domain is subdivided into a number of segments, and a four-way array is then set to estimate the STF-time/segment (TS) model of the data using the four-way PARAFAC. The correct number of the factors of the STF model is effectively estimated by using a novel core consistency diagnostic- (CORCONDIA-) based measure. Subsequently, the STF-TS model is shown to closely approximate the classic STF model, with significantly lower computational cost. The results confirm that the proposed algorithm effectively identifies and removes the EB artifact from raw EEG measurements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4463659/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2008","volume":"55","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"10158542","pubMedId":"18713691","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4463659/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Removal of the Eye-Blink Artifacts From EEGs via STF-TS Modeling and Robust Minimum Variance Beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Removal of the Eye-Blink Artifacts From EEGs via STF-TS Modeling and Robust Minimum Variance Beamforming","sourcePdf":"55tbme09-nazarpour.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099109S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4603151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4603151","articleId":"4463659","onlineDate":"05 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":4463663,"authors":[{"name":"Steven R.

The approach of measuring the differential noise figure may be automated with one switch at the output of a standard noise source and one switch at the input to a standard noise figure analyzer or a noise figure meter, allowing for automated noise figure measurements of differential LNAs based on the differential pair topology.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4531714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2008.917673","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/4531714/04463664.pdf","startPage":"1298","endPage":"1303","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2008.917673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Technique for Differential Noise Figure Measurement of Differential LNAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Technique for Differential Noise Figure Measurement of Differential LNAs","volume":"57","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4463664/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10006683","dateOfInsertion":"28 May 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4463664/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Technique for Differential Noise Figure Measurement of Differential LNAs","sourcePdf":"57tim07-belostotski.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052892S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"4531714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4531714","articleId":"4463664","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4463695,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Kamkin","affiliation":["Institute for System Programming, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Kamkin","id":"37601691200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3071-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4463695","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System testing","Hardware design languages","Software testing","Object oriented modeling","Formal verification","Computer architecture","Formal specifications","Software systems","Functional programming","Scalability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["formal specification","formal verification","hardware description languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UniTESK","specification-based validation","hardware designs","functional validation","functional correctness","hardware systems","formal verification techniques","formal specifications","software systems","Verilog HDL","SystemC designs"]}],"abstract":"Functional validation is a major bottleneck in hardware design. Two main approaches to ensure functional correctness of hardware systems are based on formal verification and simulation techniques. It is widely recognized that formal verification techniques are exhaustive but do not scale well; simulation-based techniques are scalable but are not exhaustive. Possible compromise is provided by semi-formal approaches combining formal specifications, functional coverage definition, and simulation. This paper describes the UniTESK approach to specification-based validation of hardware designs in which a good balance of exhaustiveness and scalability is found. UniTESK is originally intended for the development of high-quality functional tests for software systems. The paper shows how to adapt it for functional validation of Verilog HDL and SystemC designs.","doi":"10.1109/ISoLA.2006.42","publicationTitle":"Second International Symposium on Leveraging Applications of Formal Methods, Verification and Validation (isola 2006)","displayPublicationTitle":"Second International Symposium on Leveraging Applications of Formal Methods, Verification and Validation (isola 2006)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4463675/4463676/04463695.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"66","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISoLA.2006.42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4463676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The UniTESK Approach to Specification-Based Validation of Hardware Designs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4463695","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Nov. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4463695/","displayDocTitle":"The UniTESK Approach to Specification-Based Validation of Hardware Designs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9904064","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4463695/","conferenceDate":"15-19 Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The UniTESK Approach to Specification-Based Validation of Hardware Designs","confLoc":"Paphos, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"3071a060.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077434S","chronDate":"15-19 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4463675","isNumber":"4463676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4463675","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4463676","articleId":"4463695","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4463770,"authors":[{"name":"Yiqing Zhou","affiliation":["University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"p":["Yiqing Zhou [s103, M105] received a B.S. degree in communication and information engineering, and an M.S. degree in signal and information processing from Southeast Uni-versity, China, in 1997 and 2000, respectively.

Nevertheless, as a standalone system it will never offer global services, and to complement its capabilities, the utilization of broadband space-based access shared among users represents a scalable and cost-effective solution to offer wider area coverage, improved performance in terms of QoS, service continuity in case of terrestrial network failure, and long-range user mobility. Integration between WiMAX and a space-based infrastructure, composed of a combination of satellites and high altitude platforms, can be pursued in several ways. The simplest solution is based on connecting a WiMAX network by means of a terrestrial network terminating at a hub station connected to the space infrastructure. A more flexible solution should allow the WiMAX subscriber station or base station to directly access the space infrastructure. This article addresses the identification of suitable scenarios and a feasibility analysis presenting link budget results related to a subset of the identified solutions.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2008.4463771","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/4463756/04463771.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"57","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2008.4463771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4463756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interoperability between WiMAXand broadband mobile space networks [topics in radio communications]","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4463771","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4463771/","displayDocTitle":"Interoperability between WiMAXand broadband mobile space networks [topics in radio communications]","volume":"46","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9902652","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4463771/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interoperability between WiMAXand broadband mobile space networks [topics in radio communications]","sourcePdf":"15GIULIANO.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07428S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"4463756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4463756","articleId":"4463771","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4463772,"authors":[{"name":"David Soldani","affiliation":["Nokia Siemens Networks"],"bio":{"p":["David Soldani (david.soldani@nsn.com) received his M.Sc. in electronic engineering from University of Florence, Italy, and his D.Sck. in technology from Helsinki University of Technology, Finland.

It is suggested that these tools be adopted by researchers when presenting their results to provide their audience with a quantitative metric for proper interpretation of empirically estimated ROC curves.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2008.915928","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/4481081/04463787.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2008.915928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4481081","startPage":"251","endPage":"255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve Confidence Intervals and Regions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4463787","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve Confidence Intervals and Regions","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4463787/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 April 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"5","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9976160","dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4463787/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve Confidence Intervals and Regions","sourcePdf":"05lgrs02-kerekes.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085227S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"4481081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"4481081","articleId":"4463787","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4463788,"authors":[{"name":"Alina Zare","affiliation":["Department of Computer Information Science and Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Alina","lastName":"Zare","id":"37265759000"},{"name":"Paul Gader","affiliation":["Department of Computer Information Science and Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Gader","id":"37271974000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"4463788","dbTime":"38 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":65,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":708},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Hyperspectral sensors","SPICE","Principal component analysis","Government","Detection algorithms","Layout","Noise reduction","Military computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical signal processing","image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperspectral band selection","endmember detection","hyperspectral imagery","sparsity promoting iterated constrained endmember SPICE algorithm","AVIRIS Indian Pines data set"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Band selection","dimensionality reduction","endmember","hyperspectral imagery","sparsity promotion"]},{"kwd":["Band selection","dimensionality reduction","endmember","hyperspectral imagery","sparsity promotion"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperspectral Band Selection and Endmember Detection Using Sparsity Promoting Priors","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2008.915934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4481081","endPage":"260","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/4481081/04463788.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2008.915934","startPage":"256","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4463788","abstract":"This letter presents a simultaneous band selection and endmember detection algorithm for hyperspectral imagery.

In order to make the PV generation system more flexible and expandable, the backstage power circuit is composed of a high step-up converter and a pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) inverter. In the dc-dc power conversion, the high step-up converter is introduced to improve the conversion efficiency of conventional boost converters and to allow the parallel operation of low-voltage PV modules. Moreover, an adaptive total sliding-mode control system is designed for the current control of the PWM inverter to maintain the output current with a higher power factor and less variation under load changes. In addition, an adaptive step-perturbation method is proposed to achieve the objective of maximum power point tracking, and an active sun tracking scheme without any light sensors is investigated to make PV plates face the sun directly in order to capture maximum irradiation and enhance system efficiency. Experimental results are given to verify the validity of the high step-up converter, the PWM inverter control, the ASP method, and the active sun tracker for a grid-connected PV generation system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4509511/04463791.pdf","startPage":"953","endPage":"964","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.919744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.919744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509511","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4463791","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Generation System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Photovoltaic systems","Solar power generation","Mesh generation","Pulse width modulation inverters","DC-DC power converters","Sun","Pulse width modulation converters","Power generation","Pulse generation","Flexible printed circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","DC-DC power convertors","electric current control","photovoltaic power systems","power generation control","power grids","PWM invertors","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grid-connected photovoltaic generation system","PV generation system","high step-up converter","pulsewidth-modulation inverter","dc-dc power conversion","boost converters","adaptive total sliding-mode control system","current control","PWM inverter","power factor","adaptive step-perturbation method","maximum power point tracking","active sun tracking scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active sun tracking scheme","adaptive step-perturbation (ASP) method","high step-up converter","photovoltaic (PV) generation system","pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) inverter","total sliding-mode control (TSMC)"]},{"kwd":["Photovoltaic generation system","pulse-width-modulation inverter","high step-up converter","total sliding-mode control","adaptive step-perturbation method","active sun tracking scheme"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4463791/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Generation System","volume":"55","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4463791/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9960774","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Generation System","sourcePdf":"55tcsi03-wai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078359S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4509511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"148","xplore-issue":"4509511","articleId":"4463791","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4463814,"authors":[{"name":"Yuichiro Mitani","affiliation":["Corporate Research and Development Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7298/4463806/4463814/4463814-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuichiro Mitani received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in material science and engineering from Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, in 1990 and 1992, respectively.","In 1992, he joined the Research and Development (R&D) Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan, where his primary works were concerned with the Si-CVD and the ultrashallow junction process technology.

It is also experimentally confirmed that hydrogen plays an important role in these phenomena. On the basis of these results, we proposed nitrogen-originated NBT degradation involving hydrogen at SiON/Si interface and hole trapping/detrapping. Furthermore, NBTI under ac stress was investigated.

The presented method is named as adaptive field effect transistor modulation (AFM) since multiple field effect transistors (FETs) with different characteristics (different sizes) are applied in parallel such that the number of driven FETs and their respective gate driving voltage are adaptive to load current. The capability of adaptive modulation of FETs' parasitic charges and resistances along with adaptive gate driving voltage allows the optimization of equivalent FET characteristics over a wide load range. Moreover, the AFM operation under load dynamic conditions is studied and a scheme is proposed. The AFM operates at a fixed switching frequency for almost the entire load range. Therefore, it has no impact on the operation and the dynamic performance of a conventional buck VR, and it is easy to implement. In this paper, the concept, design and theoretical analysis of the AFM are discussed and verified experimentally. Even though the simulation and experimental works design example given in this paper is for lower power and low voltage converter with discrete components for demonstration purposes, the AFM may have better improvement in higher power and/or higher voltage applications and in integrated voltage regulators.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2007.915184","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4463842/04463843.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2007.915184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4463842","startPage":"896","endPage":"906","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and Design of Voltage Regulator With Adaptive FET Modulation Scheme and Improved Efficiency","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4463843","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Design of Voltage Regulator With Adaptive FET Modulation Scheme and Improved Efficiency","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4463843/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9918544","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4463843/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Design of Voltage Regulator With Adaptive FET Modulation Scheme and Improved Efficiency","sourcePdf":"23tpel02-abdelrahman.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078857S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4463842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4463842","articleId":"4463843","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4463847,"authors":[{"name":"Massimo Bongiorno","affiliation":["Department of Energy and Environment, Division of Electric Power Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4463842/4463847/4463847-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Massimo Bongiorno (S'02) received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy, in 2002 and the Lic.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees from Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.","Since October 2007, he has been an Assistant Professor at Chalmers University of Technology.

This analysis method has been verified through simulation and experimentation. The simple formulation developed permits optimization of the capacitor sizes to meet a constraint such as a total capacitance or total energy storage limit, and also permits optimization of the switch sizes subject to constraints on total switch conductances or total switch volt-ampere (V-A) products. These optimizations then permit comparison among several switched-capacitor topologies, and comparisons of SC converters with conventional magnetic-based dc-dc converter circuits, in the context of various application settings. Significantly, the performance (based on conduction loss) of a ladder-type converter is found to be superior to that of a conventional magnetic-based converter for medium to high conversion ratios.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2007.915182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4463842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2007.915182","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4463842/04463867.pdf","startPage":"841","endPage":"851","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and Optimization of Switched-Capacitor DC\u2013DC Converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Optimization of Switched-Capacitor DC\u2013DC Converters","volume":"23","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4463867/","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9918582","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4463867/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Optimization of Switched-Capacitor DC\u2013DC Converters","sourcePdf":"23tpel02-seeman.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07636S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4463842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"592","xplore-issue":"4463842","articleId":"4463867","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":4463870,"authors":[{"name":"Huafeng Xiao","affiliation":["College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4463842/4463870/4463870-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huafeng Xiao was born in Hubei, China, in 1982.

Multidimensional measurement data, including path-loss, delay spread and direction-of-arrival are compared with simulations performed with a 3D ray tracing model which takes diffuse scattering into account. The results are analyzed highlighting the dominant propagation mechanisms in the different cases and model performance/shortcomings. In particular, the results show that diffuse scattering plays a key role in urban propagation, with an impact on both narrowband and wideband parameters in most cases. Also, the accuracy and the characteristics of environment representation can have a significant impact on prediction even in simple topologies.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4463877/04463895.pdf","startPage":"848","endPage":"857","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2008.916893","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2008.916893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4463877","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4463895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Multipath Propagation in Urban Environment Through Multidimensional Measurements and Advanced Ray Tracing Simulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multidimensional systems","Ray tracing","Analytical models","Delay","Performance evaluation","Performance analysis","Scattering parameters","Narrowband","Wideband","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","microwave measurement","multipath channels","radiowave propagation","ray tracing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipath propagation","micro-cellular environment","macro-cellular environment","urban propagation","ray tracing","microwave measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microwave measurements","prediction methods","ray tracing","scattering","urban propagation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4463895/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Multipath Propagation in Urban Environment Through Multidimensional Measurements and Advanced Ray Tracing Simulation","volume":"56","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4463895/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9918437","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Multipath Propagation in Urban Environment Through Multidimensional Measurements and Advanced Ray Tracing Simulation","sourcePdf":"56tap03-fuschini.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075613S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4463877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"4463877","articleId":"4463895","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4463896,"authors":[{"name":"George W.

The antenna system consists of an array of two printed dipoles separated by a distance of a quarter wavelength. Each of the dipoles can be reconfigured in length using PIN diode switches. The switch configuration can be modified in a manner adaptive to changes in the environment. The configuration of switches effects the mutual coupling between the array elements, and subsequently, the radiation pattern of each antenna, leading to different degrees of pattern diversity which can be used to improve link capacity. The PIN diode-based reconfigurable antenna solution is first motivated through a capacity analysis of the antenna in a clustered MIMO channel model. A new definition of spatial correlation coefficient is introduced to include the effects of antenna mismatch and radiation efficiency when quantifying the benefit of pattern diversity. Next, the widespread applicability of the proposed technique is demonstrated, relative to conventional half wavelength printed dipoles, using computational electromagnetic simulation in an outdoor and indoor environment and field measurements in an indoor laboratory environment. It is shown for the 2 times 2 system considered in this paper, that an average improvement of 10% and 8% is achieved in link capacity for a signal to noise ratio (SNR) respectively of 10 dB and 20 dB in an indoor environment compared to a system employing non reconfigurable antenna arrays.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2008.916908","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4463877/04463909.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2008.916908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4463877","startPage":"869","endPage":"881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Evaluation of a Reconfigurable Antenna Array for MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4463909","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and Evaluation of a Reconfigurable Antenna Array for MIMO Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4463909/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9918449","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4463909/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Evaluation of a Reconfigurable Antenna Array for MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"56tap03-piazza.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.557045S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4463877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"199","xplore-issue":"4463877","articleId":"4463909","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4463910,"authors":[{"name":"Daniele Pinchera","affiliation":["DAEIMI, University of Cassino, Cassino, Italy"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Pinchera","id":"37303235100"},{"name":"Jon W.

We also provide a simplified ECT, which is much easier to implement. In the ECT, a stability criterion is first constructed to identify instable irregular cells, i.e., those having so small an area to cause instability. Those instable cells are then enlarged into their adjacent cells to obtain a large, stable area. Careful treatment is performed on the communication between the intruding and intruded cells in terms of electromotive force by keeping the total electromotive force conservative. This technique is verified by several 3-D numerical experiments.

In the first part, we investigate the robustness of TR-based imaging techniques via the decomposition of TR operator (DORT) algorithm and the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm under clutter and (additive) noise. In the second part, we examine the effect of TR-invariance breaking (due to losses in the intervening media) on the performance of both DORT and (TR-based) MUSIC. In the third part, effects of translational perturbations of the TR array are examined, as a class of model perturbations.

Recently developed methods for learning sparse classifiers, which combine the automatic feature selection and classifier design, established themselves among the state of the art in the literature of machine learning. In this letter, the sparse multinomial logistic regression (SMLR) is introduced into the community of remote sensing and is utilized for the feature selection in the classification of hyperspectral data. To relieve the heavy degeneration of classification performance caused by the characteristics of the hyperspectral data and the oversparsity when the SMLR selects a small feature subset, we develop a dynamic learning framework to train the SMLR. Experimental results attest to the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2008.915930","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/4481081/04464110.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2008.915930","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4481081","startPage":"280","endPage":"284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Learning of SMLR for Feature Selection and Classification of Hyperspectral Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4464110","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Learning of SMLR for Feature Selection and Classification of Hyperspectral Data","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4464110/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 April 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"5","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9976181","dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4464110/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Learning of SMLR for Feature Selection and Classification of Hyperspectral Data","sourcePdf":"05lgrs02-zhong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06591S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"4481081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"4481081","articleId":"4464110","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4464125,"authors":[{"name":"Edgar A.

Custom electronics can be used to achieve such goals, and by making them scalable, a large number of electrodes can be accessed in an experiment. In this work, we present a system built around a custom 16-channel IC that can stimulate and record, within 3 ms of the stimulus, on the stimulating channel, and within 500 mus on adjacent channels. This effectiveness is achieved by directly discharging the electrode through a novel feedback scheme, and by shaping such feedback to optimize electrode behavior. We characterize the different features of the system that makes such performance possible and present biological data that show the system in operation. To enable this characterization, we present a framework for measuring, classifying, and understanding the multiple sources of stimulus artifacts. This framework facilitates comparisons between artifact elimination methodologies and enables future artifact studies.","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2008.918285","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4156126/4489964/04464125.pdf","startPage":"10","endPage":"21","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2008.918285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4489964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stimulus-Artifact Elimination in a Multi-Electrode System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4464125","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4464125/","displayDocTitle":"Stimulus-Artifact Elimination in a Multi-Electrode System","volume":"2","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9918403","pubMedId":"23852629","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4464125/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stimulus-Artifact Elimination in a Multi-Electrode System","sourcePdf":"02tbcas01-brown.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081362S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"4489964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"4489964","articleId":"4464125","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4464133,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

A new adder graph data structure called the multiroot binary partition graph (MBPG) is proposed for the formulation of the multiple constant multiplication problem of FIR filter design. The set of coefficients in any fixed point representation is partitioned into symbols so that common subexpression identification and elimination become congruent to information parsing for data compression. A minimum number of different pairs or groups of symbols and residues can be used to code a set of coefficients based on their probability and conditional probability of occurrence. This ingenious concept enables the notion of entropy to be applied as a quantitative measure to evaluate the coding density of different compositions of symbols towards a set of coefficients. The minimal vertex set MBPG synthesized by our proposed information theoretic approach results in direct correspondences between the vertices and adders, and edges and physical interconnections. Unlike the common subexpression elimination algorithms based on other graph data structures, the symbol-level information carried in each vertex and the graph isomorphism of MBPG promise further fine-grain optimization in a reduced search space. One such optimization that has been exploited in this paper is the shift-inclusive computation reordering to minimize the width of every two's complement adder to further reduce the implementation cost and the critical path delay of the filter. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm can contribute up to 19.30% reductions in logic complexity and up to 61.03% reduction in critical path delay over other minimization methods.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.920090","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4627555/04468689.pdf","startPage":"2310","endPage":"2321","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.920090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4627555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information Theoretic Approach to Complexity Reduction of FIR Filter Design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4468689","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4468689/","displayDocTitle":"Information Theoretic Approach to Complexity Reduction of FIR Filter Design","volume":"55","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10235350","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4468689/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information Theoretic Approach to Complexity Reduction of FIR Filter Design","sourcePdf":"55tcsi08-chang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127361S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4627555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4627555","articleId":"4468689","onlineDate":"07 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4468691,"authors":[{"name":"Pinar Korkmaz","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA","Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4627555/4468691/4468691-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pinar Korkmaz (S'01\u2013M'08) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical and electronics engineering from the Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 1998, and 2000, respectively, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, in 2002 and 2007, respectively.","She is currently with the Intel Corporation's Logic Technology Development Division, Hillsboro, OR, where she is a Circuit Design Engineer in the Digital Circuits Technology Integration group."]},"firstName":"Pinar","lastName":"Korkmaz","id":"37295451300"},{"name":"Bilge E.

The proposed neural network is modeled by a differential inclusion. Compared with the existing neural networks for solving nonsmooth convex optimization problems, this neural network has a wider domain for implementation. Under a suitable assumption on the constraint set, it is proved that for a given nonsmooth convex optimization problem and sufficiently large penalty parameters, any trajectory of the neural network can reach the feasible region in finite time and stays there thereafter. Moreover, we can prove that the trajectory of the neural network constructed by a differential inclusion and with arbitrarily given initial value, converges to the set consisting of the equilibrium points of the neural network, whose elements are all the optimal solutions of the primal constrained optimization problem. In particular, we give the condition that the equilibrium point set of the neural network coincides with the optimal solution set of the primal constrained optimization problem and the condition ensuring convergence to the optimal solution set in finite time. Furthermore, illustrative examples show the correctness of the results in this paper, and the good performance of the proposed neural network.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.920131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4627555","startPage":"2378","endPage":"2391","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4627555/04468696.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subgradient-Based Neural Networks for Nonsmooth Convex Optimization Problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4468696/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4468696/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Subgradient-Based Neural Networks for Nonsmooth Convex Optimization Problems","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10235358","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"8","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subgradient-Based Neural Networks for Nonsmooth Convex Optimization Problems","sourcePdf":"55tcsi08-xue.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12836S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4627555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"4627555","articleId":"4468696","onlineDate":"07 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":4468697,"authors":[{"name":"Alfio Zanchi","affiliation":["Linear Technology Corporation, Colorado Springs, CO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4627555/4468697/4468697-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alfio Zanchi (S'94\u2013M'01\u2013SM'05) was born in Alzano Lombardo, Bergamo, Italy, in 1971.

However, the existing methods typically handle only deliberately displayed and exaggerated expressions of prototypical emotions despite the fact that deliberate behaviour differs in visual appearance, audio profile, and timing from spontaneously occurring behaviour. To address this problem, efforts to develop algorithms that can process naturally occurring human affective behaviour have recently emerged. Moreover, an increasing number of efforts are reported toward multimodal fusion for human affect analysis including audiovisual fusion, linguistic and paralinguistic fusion, and multi-cue visual fusion based on facial expressions, head movements, and body gestures. This paper introduces and surveys these recent advances. We first discuss human emotion perception from a psychological perspective. Next we examine available approaches to solving the problem of machine understanding of human affective behavior, and discuss important issues like the collection and availability of training and test data. We finally outline some of the scientific and engineering challenges to advancing human affect sensing technology.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2008.52","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2008.52","startPage":"39","endPage":"58","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4688941/04468714.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4688941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey of Affect Recognition Methods: Audio, Visual, and Spontaneous Expressions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4468714/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Survey of Affect Recognition Methods: Audio, Visual, and Spontaneous Expressions","volume":"31","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10324622","pubMedId":"19029545","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4468714/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey of Affect Recognition Methods: Audio, Visual, and Spontaneous Expressions","sourcePdf":"ttp2009010039.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.253424S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4688941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"1611","xplore-issue":"4688941","articleId":"4468714","onlineDate":"07 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-27"},{"_id":4468747,"authors":[{"name":"Lee-Eun Yu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Division of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Lee-Eun","lastName":"Yu","id":"37401411000"},{"name":"Sungho Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Division of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sungho","lastName":"Kim","id":"37309966900"},{"name":"Min-Ki Ryu","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Min-Ki","lastName":"Ryu","id":"37589784000"},{"name":"Sung-Yool Choi","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-Yool","lastName":"Choi","id":"37405761200"},{"name":"Yang-Kyu Choi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Division of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yang-Kyu","lastName":"Choi","id":"37277373300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"4468747","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":72,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":2142},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4468747","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dry etching","Switches","Electrodes","Random access memory","Nonvolatile memory","Sputtering","Plasma applications","Breakdown voltage","Transistors","Fabrication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium","random-access storage","space charge","switching circuits","titanium compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["structure effects","resistive switching","Al/TiOx/Al devices","RRAM","via-hole-type devices","via-hole structure","crossbar structure","asymmetric switching behavior","top Al/TiOx interfaces","bottom Al/TiOx interfaces","space-charge-limited-current model","resistance random access memory","Al-TiOx-Al"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Crossbar structure","resistance random access memory (RRAM)","resistive switching","space-charge-limited conduction","via-hole structure","metal\u2013insulator\u2013metal (MIM)"]},{"kwd":["Crossbar structure","resistance random access memory (RRAM)","resistive switching","space-charge-limited conduction","via-hole structure","metal\u2013insulator\u2013metal (MIM)"]}],"abstract":"Resistive switching characteristics are investigated for Al/TiO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">x</sub>\n/Al devices, particularly for the structural effects in crossbar and via-hole-type devices.

The proposed focal plane decomposition is compared to the 2-D discrete wavelet transform (DWT) decomposition commonly used in state of the art compression schemes such as SPIHT and JPEG2000. The method achieves comparable compression performance with much lower computational complexity and allows image compression to be implemented directly on the sensor focal plane in a completely pixel parallel structure. A CMOS prototype chip has been fabricated and tested. The test results validate the pixel design and demonstrate that lossy prediction based focal plane image compression can be realized inside the sensor pixel array to achieve a high frame rate with much lower data readout volume.

Our study is focused on outdoor environments characterized by a moderate angular spread. We consider two techniques that are able to separate the downlink data streams associated with different users and to guarantee a fixed error probability by exploiting limited feedback from each user. The grid of beams (GoBs) and the proposed adaptive GoB (AGoB) differ in the way the precoders are designed (by adaptive or fixed processing) and in their scheduling policy. The new AGoB is able to harness partial knowledge of the downlink channel spatial structure to better select the users and adjust their precoders for downlink transmission. The performances of GoB and AGoB are compared in this paper in terms of throughput and cell coverage capability. The radio interface is adapted to fit the requirements for the adaptive modulation and coding with advanced antenna system (AMC-AAS) mode of the IEEE 802.16-2005 standard. Numerical results show that, as long as the channel exhibits a limited angular spread at the base station, the AGoB technique is able to provide significant throughput gains compared with the fixed GoB approach. On the other hand, large angular spreads are proved to have a substantial impact on system performance as the benefits of adaptation are significantly reduced.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.920474","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4749378/04468907.pdf","startPage":"218","endPage":"230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.920474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4749378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparative Analysis of Spatial Multiplexing Techniques for Outdoor MIMO-OFDM Systems with a Limited Feedback Constraint","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4468907","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4468907/","displayDocTitle":"A Comparative Analysis of Spatial Multiplexing Techniques for Outdoor MIMO-OFDM Systems with a Limited Feedback Constraint","volume":"58","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10391734","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4468907/","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparative Analysis of Spatial Multiplexing Techniques for Outdoor MIMO-OFDM Systems with a Limited Feedback Constraint","sourcePdf":"58tvt01-savazzi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080643S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4749378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4749378","articleId":"4468907","onlineDate":"07 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4468915,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

Therefore, this paper introduces a new technique based on wavelet transform for accurate fault location of six-phase transmission lines. The technique utilizes a wavelet to capture the fault induced high frequency transient currents superimposed on the power frequency currents in a modal domain. The fault location is determined based on the relative arrival times of these high frequency transient signals at the relaying point. The introduced technique is tested and validated through simulation studies. The results show that the technique is accurate in fault location irrespective of the fault type, fault inception angle, and fault resistance.

Genetic Algorithm (GA) is one of the modern optimization techniques, which has been successfully applied in various areas in power systems. Most of the corrective control actions involve simultaneous optimization of several objective functions, which are competing and conflicting each other. The multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is used to optimize the corrective control actions. Three different procedures based on GA and MOGA are proposed to alleviate the violations of the overloaded lines and minimize the transmission line losses. The first procedure is based on corrective switching of the transmission lines and generation re-dispatch. The second procedure is carried out to determine the optimal siting and sizing of distributed generation (DG). While, the third procedure is concerned into solving the generation-load imbalance problem using load shedding. Numerical simulations are carried out on two test systems in order to examine the validity of the proposed procedures.","doi":"10.1109/UPEC.2007.4468975","startPage":"365","endPage":"376","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 42nd International Universities Power Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4468832/4468909/04468975.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 42nd International Universities Power Engineering Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UPEC.2007.4468975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4468909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal corrective actions for power systems using multiobjective genetic algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power systems","Genetic algorithms","Power system restoration","Power transmission lines","Optimal control","Control systems","Power system control","Propagation losses","Distributed control","Numerical simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","genetic algorithms","load shedding","optimal control","power generation control","power generation dispatch","power system restoration","power system security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal corrective control action","secure operation","power system restoration","multiobjective genetic algorithm","optimization techniques","overloaded lines","transmission line losses","generation redispatch","distributed generation","generation load imbalance problem","load shedding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Corrective control actions","Multi-objective genetic algorithm","generation re-dispatch","distributed generation","load shedding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4468975/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Optimal corrective actions for power systems using multiobjective genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4468975/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2008","conferenceDate":"4-6 Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9870213","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal corrective actions for power systems using multiobjective genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-03042008-00066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104352S","chronDate":"4-6 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4468832","isNumber":"4468909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4468832","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4468909","articleId":"4468975","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"UPECIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4468997,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodi Song","affiliation":["Glasgow Caledonian University, Glasgow, UK"],"lastName":"Xiaodi Song","id":"37595658400"},{"name":"Martin Judd","affiliation":["University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Judd","id":"37270295800"},{"name":"Chengke Zhou","affiliation":["Glasgow Caledonian University, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Chengke","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37276314100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-905593-36-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-905593-34-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4468997","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":256},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Partial discharges","Pulse transformers","Discrete wavelet transforms","Working environment noise","Monitoring","Power transformers","UHF measurements","Fault detection","Pulse measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","partial discharges","power transformers","UHF devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal algorithm","PD pulse","partial discharge","UHF detection system","ultra-high-frequency techniques","HV transformers","fast transient pulses","triangulation algorithm","discrete wavelets transform","DWT"]}],"abstract":"The detection and localisation of partial discharge (PD) activities is gaining importance in maintaining operational transformers and diagnosing those which are faulty. Ultra-high-frequency (UHF) techniques have been applied successfully to detection of PD activities in HV transformers because of their sensitivity to fast transient pulses. When an UHF PD monitoring system is applied, one of the crucial pieces of information that need to be preserved is the arrival time which allows the Triangulation algorithm to be applied for localisation of PD source(s). Unfortunately, the presence of noise in the UHF signals can complicate the application. This paper presents the results of a study which has been carried out as a joint effort between Glasgow Caledonian University and University of Strathclyde to investigate the efficacy of applying discrete wavelets transform (DWT) to the extraction of PD pulses from noisy environments and the determination of their arrival times in UHF signals. Studies on practically acquired UHF signals from an in-service power transformer prove that DWT is effective in locating the arrival times of PD pulses when the standard deviation (SD) of added noise is no greater than the maximum magnitude of the PD pulses.","doi":"10.1109/UPEC.2007.4468997","publicationTitle":"2007 42nd International Universities Power Engineering Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 42nd International Universities Power Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4468832/4468909/04468997.pdf","startPage":"495","endPage":"498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UPEC.2007.4468997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4468909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An optimal algorithm for applying wavelet transform in identifying the arrival time of PD pulse in a UHF detection system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4468997","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4468997/","displayDocTitle":"An optimal algorithm for applying wavelet transform in identifying the arrival time of PD pulse in a UHF detection system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9870235","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4468997/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An optimal algorithm for applying wavelet transform in identifying the arrival time of PD pulse in a UHF detection system","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-03042008-00088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063525S","chronDate":"4-6 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4468832","isNumber":"4468909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4468832","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4468909","articleId":"4468997","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"UPECIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4469004,"authors":[{"name":"Chunyan Li","affiliation":["Wuhan University of China, China"],"lastName":"Chunyan Li","id":"37087249238"},{"name":"Yuanzhang Sun","affiliation":["Wuhan University of China, China"],"lastName":"Yuanzhang Sun","id":"37087254220"},{"name":"Xiangyi Chen","affiliation":["Wuhan University of China, China"],"lastName":"Xiangyi Chen","id":"37087415481"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-905593-36-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-905593-34-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4469004","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":318},"abstract":"On November 4, 2006 at 22:10 local time, the UCTE (union for the coordination of the transmission of electricity) interconnected grid was split into three islands after the tripping of many high voltage lines due to overload, driving consumers with a total load of 14.5 GW into blackout.

The optimal investment to be performed is a function of generating ability of new units which are dimensioned according to the energy generation ability, to the impact caused by new interconnections and to the energy supply criterion. Thus, this work aims at obtaining the optimal planning of the existing power plants through the building perspective of new generation units in order to meet the market in a trustful and economic manner. However, the problem involves several expansion programs of thermal and hydro plants and several synthetic series corresponding to the hydro scenarios, giving the problem a combinatorial problem. In order to do so, herein we will use a genetic algorithm, which presents a particular genetic structure and incorporate rules used by the system planner, to search for the best expansion strategy independently. To improve the agility of the genetic algorithm in achieving the convergence, a solution based on global parallel computing was implemented. The algorithm response time decreases in a quite linear rate as we grow the computers network.","doi":"10.1109/UPEC.2007.4469041","pdfPath":"/iel5/4468832/4468909/04469041.pdf","startPage":"738","endPage":"744","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 42nd International Universities Power Engineering Conference","publicationTitle":"2007 42nd International Universities Power Engineering Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UPEC.2007.4469041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4468909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Global parallel genetic algorithm approach applied to long term generation expansion planning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469041/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Global parallel genetic algorithm approach applied to long term generation expansion planning","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2008","accessionNumber":"9870278","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4469041/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global parallel genetic algorithm approach applied to long term generation expansion planning","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-03042008-00132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070777S","chronDate":"4-6 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4468832","isNumber":"4468909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4468832","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4468909","articleId":"4469041","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"UPECIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4469077,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The proposed technique is based on estimating the synchronizing and damping torque coefficients from online measurements of the changes of the rotor angle, rotor speed, and electromagnetic torque of the synchronous machine using Adaline architecture. These coefficients can be used as indices, which provide insight into the small-signal stability of power systems. The proposed approach can quickly predict the possible unstable conditions and hence help the operator to take the correct control action beforehand. The performance of the Adaline is compared with both Kalman filter and least-square error techniques. The Adaline offers several advantages including significant reduction in computing time and storage as well as remarkable reduction in the computational complexity, which is associated with Kalman filter. The simulation results over a wide range of operating conditions show that the Adaline can be used as efficient tool for either online or offline estimation of the synchronizing and damping torque coefficients. Therefore, it is believed that Adaline is a strong candidate for online monitoring of small-signal stability and security.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469095/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4469095/","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9870331","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fast estimation of synchronizing and damping torque coefficients using an adaptive neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast estimation of synchronizing and damping torque coefficients using an adaptive neural network","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-03042008-00186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05975S","chronDate":"4-6 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4468832","isNumber":"4468909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4468832","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4468909","articleId":"4469095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"UPECIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4469108,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In the proposed work, a non-traditional optimization technique, modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) is used to optimize the various process parameters involved of FACTS devices in a power system. The various parameters taken into consideration were the location of the device, their type, and their rated value of the devices. The simulation was performed on a modified IEEE 30-bus power system with two types of FACTS controllers (SVC, TCSC), modeled for steady state studies. The optimization results clearly indicate that introduction of FACTS devices in a right location increases the loadability of the system and algorithm can be effectively used for this kind of optimization.","doi":"10.1109/UPEC.2007.4469108","pdfPath":"/iel5/4468832/4468909/04469108.pdf","startPage":"1122","endPage":"1128","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 42nd International Universities Power Engineering Conference","publicationTitle":"2007 42nd International Universities Power Engineering Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UPEC.2007.4469108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4468909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal location of FACTS devices in a power system using modified particle swarm optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469108/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Optimal location of FACTS devices in a power system using modified particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2008","accessionNumber":"9870344","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4469108/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal location of FACTS devices in a power system using modified particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-03042008-00199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088368S","chronDate":"4-6 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4468832","isNumber":"4468909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4468832","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4468909","articleId":"4469108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"UPECIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4469110,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The circuits have many of the advantages of simply using RC or RCD snubbers, including being easily applicable to both low- and high-side switches. However, because the snubber capacitors are not fully discharged their associated reset current and power-losses are minimized. To illustrate the principle of operation experimentally, a string of three series-connected power MOSFETs switching 100 A from 330 V has been used to obtain practical waveforms. The schemes are discussed and illustrated, using SPICE simulation results. The new, relatively simple voltage-sharing schemes are much easier to design and optimize than recently reported active gate-control and regenerative-snubber methods, allow very rapid turn-on and turn-off switching, and give composite- device switches a usable voltage rating similar to the aggregated voltage ratings of the string.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469110/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2008","accessionNumber":"9870359","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4469110/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Series connecting devices for high-voltage power conversion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Series connecting devices for high-voltage power conversion","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-03042008-00201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043127S","chronDate":"4-6 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4468832","isNumber":"4468909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4468832","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4468909","articleId":"4469110","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"UPECIEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4469118,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Mohammadi","affiliation":["Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Mohammadi","id":"37089131587"},{"name":"Mostafa Jazaeri","affiliation":["Semnan University, Semnan, Iran"],"firstName":"Mostafa","lastName":"Jazaeri","id":"37418761800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-905593-36-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-905593-34-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4469118","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":659},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Power system planning","Static VAr compensators","Thyristors","Genetic algorithms","Power system simulation","Hybrid power systems","Flexible AC transmission systems","Power system stability","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible AC transmission systems","genetic algorithms","particle swarm optimisation","power systems","static VAr compensators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid particle swarm optimization-genetic algorithm","static VAR compensation device optimal location","power system planning","IEEE 68 bus test system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PSO","GA","hybrid PSO-GA","SVC placement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469118","abstract":"The particle swarm optimization (PSO) was showed to converge rapidly during the initial stages of a global search, but around global optimum, the search process will become very slow.

This dependence to the initial population is in such a manner that the algorithm may not converge if the initial population is not well selected. In this paper, we have proposed a new algorithm which combines PSO and GA in such a way that the new algorithm is more effective and efficient. Optimal location of SVC using this hybrid PSO-GA algorithm is found. We have also found the optimal place of SVC using GA and PSO separately and compared the results. It has been shown that the new algorithm is more effective and efficient.

As technology scales and device dimension shrinks, the trend in the Vt-variability at both time zero and after NBTI aging increases. The timeO Vt- variability can be explained by the random nature of dopants, whereas the randomly generated defects in the gate oxide can account for the device aging-induced variability. This paper focuses on the NBTI-induced device Vt-variability and trend across technology generations. The remarkable correlation of aging-induced Vt-variability to the gate oxide area suggests that the geometry scaling is the dominant component that drives the increased trend in aging-induced variability.","doi":"10.1109/IRWS.2007.4469214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4469203","startPage":"18","endPage":"21","pdfPath":"/iel5/4459377/4469203/04469214.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Integrated Reliability Workshop Final Report","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Integrated Reliability Workshop Final Report","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRWS.2007.4469214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of NBTI degradation on transistor variability in advanced technologies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Niobium compounds","Titanium compounds","Degradation","Transistors","Aging","Logic devices","Random access memory","Negative bias temperature instability","Geometry","Dielectrics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit stability","MOSFET","semiconductor device reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transistor variability degradation","negative bias temperature instability","device aging-induced variability","geometry scaling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Effect of NBTI degradation on transistor variability in advanced technologies","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469214/","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4469214/","accessionNumber":"9866802","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","conferenceDate":"15-18 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of NBTI degradation on transistor variability in advanced technologies","confLoc":"South Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-03032008-00011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043931S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4459377","isNumber":"4469203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4459377","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4469203","articleId":"4469214","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4469217,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Qin","affiliation":["Reliability Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Jin Qin","id":"37416843600"},{"name":"Xiaojun Li","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Folsom, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaojun Li","id":"37423490900"},{"name":"Joseph B.

The first one is based on discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and the other is based on the Gabor filters. The two are compared for texture recognition and retrieval. To have deeper insight in to the role of neighbourhood properties and the filter banks in the texture description, extensive experimentation is performed over the image sets containing noisy and rotated variants of the textures from Brodatz album. A method for estimating rotation variance (RV) of a texture descriptor is also presented, which gives an idea of how rotation-sensitive is a certain texture descriptor. The results establish that the DFT-based features outperform the features based on Gabor filters in noiseless conditions whereas the later outperform otherwise.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Texture features based on Fourier transform and Gabor filters: an empirical comparison","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICMV.2007.4469275","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Vision","pdfPath":"/iel5/4459057/4469254/04469275.pdf","startPage":"67","endPage":"72","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMV.2007.4469275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4469254","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469275","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469275/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Texture features based on Fourier transform and Gabor filters: an empirical comparison","conferenceDate":"28-29 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4469275/","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9892452","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Texture features based on Fourier transform and Gabor filters: an empirical comparison","confLoc":"Isalambad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"SPI-03012008-00021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045647S","chronDate":"28-29 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4459057","isNumber":"4469254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4459057","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4469254","articleId":"4469275","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4469300,"authors":[{"name":"Ping Si","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"],"bio":{"p":["Ping Si (M'04) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Xian JiaoTong University, Xi'an, China, in 1998, the Graduate Diploma in computer science from the University of Auckland, New Zealand, in 2002, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.","From 1998 to 1999 he worked as an engineer at the Northwest Electrical Power Testing Research Institute, China.

radio is an advanced enabling technology for efficient utilization of under-utilized spectrum since it is able to sense the spectrum and use the frequency when the primary users are absent. Recent investigation suggests that spectrum sensing is compromised when a user experiences fading or shadowing. In order to combat such effects, collaborative sensing is presented. However, the conventional collaborative sensing is not effective when users suffer from different fading environments. In this paper, we propose a weighted-collaborative scheme to improve the spectrum sensing performance under fading environment. The analysis of the simulation results proves that the weighted-collaborative scheme improves sensing performance obviously.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469340/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2008","accessionNumber":"9836077","htmlLink":"/document/4469340/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Weighted-Collaborative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighted-Collaborative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"CHINACOM-00-34.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052384S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4469305","isNumber":"4469306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4469305","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4469306","articleId":"4469340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4469341,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Qin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Qin","id":"37720216500"},{"name":"Cyril Leung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Cyril","lastName":"Leung","id":"37279072600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1009-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4469341","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":498},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","OFDM","Cognitive radio","Chromium","Bit rate","Throughput","Interference constraints","Wireless communication","FCC","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","OFDM modulation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive resource allocation","multiuser OFDM","cognitive radio systems","scarce radio spectrum resources","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","dynamic resource allocation","multiuser resource allocation","fair resource allocation"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radio (CR) is a promising concept for improving the utilization of scarce radio spectrum resources. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is regarded as a technology which is well-matched for CR systems. Dynamic resource allocation is an important task in such systems. In this paper, novel multiuser resource allocation algorithms for OFDM CR systems are presented. The algorithms attempt to maximize the total transmit bit rate (system throughput) of a group of secondary (unlicensed or CR) users subject to (1) a total transmit power constraint for secondary users, (2) a maximum tolerable interference level which can be tolerated by primary (licensed) users. The algorithms are fair in the sense that they try to allocate bits to users who have not received their fair share of service as much as possible. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a performance close to optimal. The effect on system throughput of changing various system parameter values is also examined.","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469341","publicationTitle":"2007 Second International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Second International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/4469305/4469306/04469341.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4469306","startPage":"115","endPage":"119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fair Adaptive Resource Allocation for Multiuser OFDM Cognitive Radio Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469341","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fair Adaptive Resource Allocation for Multiuser OFDM Cognitive Radio Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469341/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9836107","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4469341/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fair Adaptive Resource Allocation for Multiuser OFDM Cognitive Radio Systems","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"CHINACOM-00-35.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050708S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4469305","isNumber":"4469306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4469305","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4469306","articleId":"4469341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4469342,"authors":[{"name":"Zhu YiJun","affiliation":["Department of Communications, ZhengZhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, Henan, China"],"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":"YiJun","id":"37393778200"},{"name":"Hu Hanying","affiliation":["Department of Communications, ZhengZhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, Henan, China"],"firstName":"Hu","lastName":"Hanying","id":"37297467900"},{"name":"Duan Zhiying","affiliation":["Department of Communications, ZhengZhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, Henan, China"],"firstName":"Duan","lastName":"Zhiying","id":"37866852000"},{"name":"Tian ZhongJun","affiliation":["Department of Communications, ZhengZhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, Henan, China"],"firstName":"Tian","lastName":"ZhongJun","id":"38131095900"},{"name":"Ji Jianfeng","affiliation":["Department of Communications, ZhengZhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, Henan, China"],"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Jianfeng","id":"38117822900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1009-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4469342","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":33},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space time codes","Convolutional codes","Decoding","Channel state information","Modulation coding","Transmitters","MIMO","Wireless sensor networks","Performance analysis","Relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trellis coded modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative diversity system","Differential super-orthogonal space-time trellis code","spatial diversity gains","single antennas","channel state information","coherent detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cooperative diversity","differential modulation","super-orthogonal trellis codes","transmitter diversity","space-time code"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469342","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4469306","publicationTitle":"2007 Second International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Second International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/4469305/4469306/04469342.pdf","startPage":"120","endPage":"122","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential Super-Orthogonal Space-time Trellis Coded Cooperative Diversity System Without CSI","abstract":"The concepts of cooperative diversity promise to offer the benefits of spatial diversity gains to handheld wireless devices with single antennas.

In this paper, a scheme using association algorithm and clustering algorithm is proposed for routing anomaly detection in wireless sensor networks.

Through the combination of these two algorithms, routing attacks can be detected effectively and automatically. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that it is able to detect new attacks that have not previously been seen Moreover, the proposed detection scheme is based on no priori knowledge and then can be applied to a wide range of different sensor networks for a variety of routing attacks.","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469386","publicationTitle":"2007 Second International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Second International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/4469305/4469306/04469386.pdf","startPage":"296","endPage":"300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4469306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection Based on Data-Mining for Routing Attacks in Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469386","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469386/","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection Based on Data-Mining for Routing Attacks in Wireless Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9836114","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4469386/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection Based on Data-Mining for Routing Attacks in Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"CHINACOM-00-80.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064752S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4469305","isNumber":"4469306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4469305","xplore-issue":"4469306","articleId":"4469386","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4469390,"authors":[{"name":"Chun Yang","affiliation":["College of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Chun","lastName":"Yang","id":"38088372900"},{"name":"Feiqi Deng","affiliation":["College of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Feiqi","lastName":"Deng","id":"37271183100"},{"name":"Haidong Yang","affiliation":["College of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Haidong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37420991300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1009-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4469390","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":391},"abstract":"Previous Research in network intrusion detection system (NIDS) has typically used misuse detection or supervised anomaly detection techniques. These techniques have difficulty in detecting new types of attacks or causing high false positives in real network environment. Unsupervised anomaly detection can overcome the drawbacks of misuse detection and supervised anomaly detection. In this paper, normal-anomaly patterns are built over the network traffic dataset that uses subtractive clustering, and at the same time the built Hidden Markov Model (HMM) correlates the observation sequences and state transitions to predict the most probable intrusion state sequences. The proposed unsupervised anomaly detection approach is capable of reducing false positives by classifying intrusion sequences into different emergency levels. The experimental results are also reported using the KDDCup'99 dataset and Matlab.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Second International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/4469305/4469306/04469390.pdf","startPage":"313","endPage":"316","publicationTitle":"2007 Second International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469390","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4469306","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469390","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Approach using Subtractive Clustering and Hidden Markov Model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Intrusion detection","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Educational institutions","Automation","Computer vision","Computer networks","Data security","Computer displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer networks","hidden Markov models","pattern clustering","security of data","telecommunication security","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsupervised anomaly detection approach","subtractive clustering","hidden Markov model","network intrusion detection system","real network environment","network traffic dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["subtractive clustering","Hidden Markov Model","feature selection","intrusion detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"An Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Approach using Subtractive Clustering and Hidden Markov Model","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4469390/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9836054","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2008","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Approach using Subtractive Clustering and Hidden Markov Model","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"CHINACOM-00-84.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049156S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4469305","isNumber":"4469306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4469305","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4469306","articleId":"4469390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4469410,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this paper, a blind multistage user-by- user beamforming algorithm (UUBFA) is proposed, which, in contrast to the MSBFA, detects all the path signals for one individual user and meanwhile achieves the maximum diversity gain through a blind maximum ratio combining processing at each stage. In addition to achieving the same performance as the MSBFA, the parallel signal processing structure of the proposed UUBFA is well suited to software and hardware implementations.","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469443","publicationTitle":"2007 Second International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Second International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/4469305/4469306/04469443.pdf","startPage":"519","endPage":"523","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4469306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Blind Post-FFT User-by-user Beamforming Algorithm for Multiuser OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469443","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469443/","displayDocTitle":"A Blind Post-FFT User-by-user Beamforming Algorithm for Multiuser OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9836049","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4469443/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Blind Post-FFT User-by-user Beamforming Algorithm for Multiuser OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"CHINACOM-00-137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061467S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4469305","isNumber":"4469306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4469305","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4469306","articleId":"4469443","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4469460,"authors":[{"name":"Yueguang Bian","firstName":"Yueguang","lastName":"Bian","id":"38133090600"},{"name":"Youzheng Wang","firstName":"Youzheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281422400"},{"name":"Jing Wang","firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280524700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1009-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4469460","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Iterative decoding","Iterative algorithms","Feedback","Equations","Processor scheduling","Tin","AWGN","Belief propagation","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","error statistics","iterative decoding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error floor","LDPC code","two-stage hybrid iterative decoding algorithm","feedback BP decoding algorithm","LLR-BP decoding algorithm","belief propagation decoding algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a hybrid decoding scheme is proposed to lower the error floor of low-density parity-check codes.

Useful analytical results for performance evaluation of one-stage and two-stage diversity combining schemes are presented.

Compared to the regular SW method, these schemes can significantly improve estimation accuracy since the effects of the intersymbol interference and multipath interference can be reduced gradually through iterations. Moreover, unlike the successive cancellation (SC) estimation method, the proposed methods save the processing time of channel estimation due to their parallel-type processing manners. In addition, the performance of the proposed hybrid scheme, one of three schemes, can approach that of the SC method w ith iterations and gain a lower complexity. As a result, the proposed methods are more flexible and attractive since they can provide the tradeoff between the complexity and accuracy.

A multi-stream asynchrony dynamic Bayesian network (MS-ADBN) model is proposed for audio-visual speech recognition. Comparing with multi-stream HMM (MSHMM), MS-ADBN model describes the asynchrony of audio stream and visual stream to the word level. Simultaneously, based on profile of lip implemented by using Bayesian tangent shape model (BTSM), linear discrimination analysis (LDA) is used for visual feature extraction which describes the dynamic feature of lip and removes the redundancy of lip geometrical feature. The experiments results on continuous digit audio-visual database show that lip dynamic feature based on BTSM and LDA is more stable and robust than direct lip geometrical feature. In the noisy environments with signal to noise ratios ranging from 0 dB to 30 dB, comparing with MSHMM, MS-ADBN model with MFCC and LDA visual features has an average improvement of 4.92% in speech recognition rate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Robust Visual Feature Extraction based BTSM-LDA for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition","publicationTitle":"2007 Second International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469472","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Second International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/4469305/4469306/04469472.pdf","startPage":"637","endPage":"641","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4469306","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469472","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469472/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Robust Visual Feature Extraction based BTSM-LDA for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4469472/","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9836224","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust Visual Feature Extraction based BTSM-LDA for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"CHINACOM-00-166.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087837S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4469305","isNumber":"4469306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4469305","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4469306","articleId":"4469472","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4469477,"authors":[{"name":"Hu yunpeng","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Zhengzhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hu","lastName":"yunpeng","id":"37864946300"},{"name":"Yu Hongyi","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Zhengzhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Hongyi","id":"37294136400"},{"name":"Hu Hanying","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Zhengzhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hu","lastName":"Hanying","id":"37297467900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1009-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4469477","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Binary phase shift keying","Neodymium","Maximum likelihood estimation","AWGN channels","Information science","Signal to noise ratio","Phase shift keying","Phase estimation","Time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","frequency estimation","maximum likelihood estimation","phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semi-data-aided frequency estimation algorithm","burst-mode transmission","AWGN channel","maximum likelihood frequency estimation algorithm","CRLB","signal-to-noise ratio","pilot symbol","binary phase shift keying"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Burst transmission","frequency estimation","semi-data-aided","maximum likelihood estimation","Binary phase-shift keying (BPSK)"]}],"abstract":"This paper deals with frequency estimation for burst- mode transmissions in AWGN channel.

In the protocol, we use a semi-centralized approach to form clusters and select optimal routing of the mutihop cooperative transmission. The communication cost of these processes is discussed. Based on this protocol, we analysis the overall data communication energy consumption and established an optimization model to find the optimum network parameters. The performance of the proposed protocol is compared with LEACH, LEACH-Centralized (LEACH-C), and another virtual MIMO based multihop protocol in our previous work. Simulation results show that tremendous energy saving is achieved and the network lifetime is prolonged, with judicious choice of the protocol parameters.","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469524","publicationTitle":"2007 Second International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Second International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/4469305/4469306/04469524.pdf","startPage":"877","endPage":"881","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4469306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Semi-centralized Approach for Optimized Multihop Virtual MIMO Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469524","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469524/","displayDocTitle":"A Semi-centralized Approach for Optimized Multihop Virtual MIMO Wireless Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9836093","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4469524/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Semi-centralized Approach for Optimized Multihop Virtual MIMO Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"CHINACOM-00-218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052268S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4469305","isNumber":"4469306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4469305","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4469306","articleId":"4469524","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4469533,"authors":[{"name":"Claude Takenga","affiliation":["Institute of communications engineering, Leibniz University, Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Claude","lastName":"Takenga","id":"37300814600"},{"name":"Kyandoghere Kyamakya","affiliation":["Department of Smart System Technologies, Alpen-Adria-Universit\u00e4t Klagenfurt, Klagenfurt, Austria"],"firstName":"Kyandoghere","lastName":"Kyamakya","id":"37273084000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1009-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4469533","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":294},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469533","abstract":"An ultimate aim of mobile positioning research is to find a method providing high estimation accuracy to the user within minimum delay and at minimum cost. Conventional location techniques based on trilateration and triangulation rely on line-of-sight path between the base station antenna and the mobile unit.

This fact degrades the location performance of the conventional techniques and motivates the need for development of more accurate technique suited for these areas. Positioning system developed in this research is divided into three sub-systems. The first sub-system solves the problems related to fingerprint localization and involves neural network as key element of the positioning algorithm.

The most concern of traditional CAC strategies is to harmonize the blocking probability and dropping probability, so as to maximize the resource utility. With the development of radio network, not only resource utility is the emphasis of CAC but also fairness is becoming important. In the multimedia CDMA networks, once the high load stream traffic is admitted, it will over-use the resource greedily, which will cause the unfair use of the resource to other kinds of traffic. In this paper, we gain the accept probability of the new users by using Cobb- Douglas utility function to construct a price function, then we can get a Nash equilibrium point by using the accepting probability as the payoffs of a game. The fairness of resource utilization in different load situations is achieved by satisfying the concept of Nash equilibrium point. The analysis and simulation results show that, by using this game strategy, the fairness of resource utilization is well achieved, and it is quantified by the fairness factor of F.","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469559","publicationTitle":"2007 Second International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Second International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/4469305/4469306/04469559.pdf","startPage":"1021","endPage":"1025","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4469306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Game Theory-based Fairness Call Admission Control Scheme for CDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469559","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469559/","displayDocTitle":"A Game Theory-based Fairness Call Admission Control Scheme for CDMA Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9836056","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4469559/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Game Theory-based Fairness Call Admission Control Scheme for CDMA Systems","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"CHINACOM-00-253.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048374S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4469305","isNumber":"4469306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4469305","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4469306","articleId":"4469559","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4469564,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Huibin","affiliation":["Nokia Siemens Networks, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Huibin","id":"37933325300"},{"name":"Chen Shuping","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Shuping","id":"38540742000"},{"name":"Kokkos Asimakis","affiliation":["Nokia Siemens Networks, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kokkos","lastName":"Asimakis","id":"38115444200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1009-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4469564","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time division synchronous code division multiple access","Multiaccess communication","Resource management","Frequency","Downlink","System performance","Dynamic scheduling","Surface acoustic waves","Telecommunications","Diversity methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","packet radio networks","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicarrier TD-SCDMA HSDPA","time division duplex-synchronous code division multiple access","high speed downlink packet access","resource allocation schemes","multiuser diversity gain","time-frequency domain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["TD-SCDMA","HSDPA","scheduling","multicarrier"]}],"abstract":"Multicarrier time division duplex-synchronous code division multiple access high speed downlink packet access (Multicarrier TD-SCDMA HSDPA) is proposed to be the next step evolution of TD-SCDMA networks.

The simulation result shows that the proposed adaptive cross-layer scheduling and dynamic subcarrier allocation algorithm has shorter delay for realtime traffic and higher spectral efficiency than nonadaptive scheduling algorithm in Rayleigh fading channel.","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469567","publicationTitle":"2007 Second International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Second International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/4469305/4469306/04469567.pdf","startPage":"1057","endPage":"1061","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4469306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Cross-layer Scheduling and Dynamic Subcarrier Allocation Algorithm Based on Service-differentiation in Multiuser OFDMA System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469567","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469567/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Cross-layer Scheduling and Dynamic Subcarrier Allocation Algorithm Based on Service-differentiation in Multiuser OFDMA System","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9836091","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4469567/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Cross-layer Scheduling and Dynamic Subcarrier Allocation Algorithm Based on Service-differentiation in Multiuser OFDMA System","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"CHINACOM-00-261.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036146S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4469305","isNumber":"4469306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4469305","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4469306","articleId":"4469567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4469575,"authors":[{"name":"Yachen Wang","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China P.R."],"firstName":"Yachen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37635817800"},{"name":"Peng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China P.R."],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37363695100"},{"name":"Yuan'an Liu","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China P.R."],"firstName":"Yuan'an","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279411900"},{"name":"Junshi Liu","affiliation":["Beijing Mobile Communications Company, Beijing, China P.R."],"firstName":"Junshi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37558517700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1009-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4469575","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"abstract":"This paper introduces a new adaptive subcarrier assignment criterion for downlink grouped Multi Carrier-Code Division Multiple Access (MC-CDMA) systems. The target of the allocation is to maximize system capacity. We mainly focus on how to partition subcarriers into groups and how to efficiently assign active users into these groups. Lagrangian multipliers are employed to cope with the optimization problem. Due to the polynomial problem of transmit power for each user, we can not obtain the solution easily. Fortunately, we are able to obtain the near solution by an approximate formula and derive a near optimal allocation criterion for active users. Meanwhile, the proposed criterion is universal for any downlink subcarrier- grouping allocation schemes. Computer simulations demonstrate that the proposed criterion is efficient and feasible for practical systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Second International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/4469305/4469306/04469575.pdf","startPage":"1090","endPage":"1095","publicationTitle":"2007 Second International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469575","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4469306","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Criterion of Subcarrier Allocation for Grouped MC-CDMA Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicarrier code division multiple access","Downlink","Resource management","Bandwidth","Multiaccess communication","OFDM","Mobile communication","Power system modeling","Interference","Lagrangian functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","mobile radio","polynomials","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive subcarrier allocation","downlink grouped MC-CDMA systems","multicarrier code division multiple access","Lagrangian multipliers","optimization problem","polynomial problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MC-CDMA","subcarrier allocation","user grouping","Kuhn-Tucker condition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469575/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Criterion of Subcarrier Allocation for Grouped MC-CDMA Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4469575/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9836079","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2008","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Criterion of Subcarrier Allocation for Grouped MC-CDMA Systems","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"CHINACOM-00-269.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052262S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4469305","isNumber":"4469306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4469305","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4469306","articleId":"4469575","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4469578,"authors":[{"name":"Binggang Huang","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Binggang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37872865800"},{"name":"Yi Hui","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Hui","id":"37717637400"},{"name":"Wenqiang Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wenqiang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37597075100"},{"name":"Zhijie Zhou","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhijie","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37714736100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1009-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4469578","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive systems","Channel state information","Parity check codes","Transmitters","Wireless communication","Decoding","OFDM","Modulation coding","Error correction","Power system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","channel coding","Gaussian distribution","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","parity check codes","quadrature amplitude modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive LDPC-coded MIMO-OFDM system","partial channel state information","adaptive transmission scheme","transmit optimization algorithm","power allocation","LLR distribution","Gaussian distribution","MQAM code","wireless channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CSI","LDPC","MRC","MCS","SVD"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469578","abstract":"An adaptive transmission scheme of MIMO-OFDM system based on MQAM and LDPC code is proposed.

Correlative codes are proposed by large numbers of papers to significantly improve the spectral performance of OFDM with rectangular pulse. The large PAPR makes amplifier distort the signal before transmission and thus becomes one of the most serious drawbacks of OFDM. However, simulations illustrate that correlatively coded OFDM has much larger PAPR than uncoded OFDM. This makes its implementation very difficult. Selected mapping (SLM) is a promising PAPR reduction technique, which is distortionless and has good PAPR reducing performance.

The base station (BS) transmitter is equipped with a scheduler using a simple opportunistic beamforming strategy, which associates an intended user for each of the transmitted data streams. For the case when the channel of the scheduled users is available at the BS, we propose a joint power control and linear transmit and receive beamformers design to optimally balance the SINR values of data streams under a total power budget. The proposed method can handle multiple antennas at the BS and at the mobile users with single and/or multiple data streams per scheduled user. We consider a general problem formulations which includes minimum SINR constraints on a subset of data streams and discuss possible particularizations which can be solved more efficiently. By exploiting the uplink-downlink SINR duality, we decompose the original optimization problem as a series of remarkably simpler optimization problems which can be efficiently solved by using standard convex optimization solvers. The simulations show that the algorithm converges fast to a solution, which can be a local optimum, but is still efficient. Only one iteration of the proposed method is enough to substantially outperform the zero forcing based solution.","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469585","publicationTitle":"2007 Second International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Second International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/4469305/4469306/04469585.pdf","startPage":"1131","endPage":"1135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4469306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear Transceiver Design for SINR Balancing in MIMO Downlink Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469585","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469585/","displayDocTitle":"Linear Transceiver Design for SINR Balancing in MIMO Downlink Channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9966953","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4469585/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Transceiver Design for SINR Balancing in MIMO Downlink Channels","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"CHINACOM-00-279.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06947S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4469305","isNumber":"4469306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4469305","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4469306","articleId":"4469585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4469587,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Zhang","affiliation":["Wireless Technology Innovation (WTI) Institute, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37540278400"},{"name":"Xing Fu","affiliation":["Wireless Technology Innovation (WTI) Institute, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xing","lastName":"Fu","id":"37955914100"},{"name":"Xiaoxuan Zhu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoxuan","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37962646500"},{"name":"Jin Xu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Xu","id":"37963065500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1009-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4469587","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Control systems","MIMO","Wireless communication","Bit error rate","Power system reliability","Communication system control","Vehicles","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","OFDM modulation","radio links","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive frame structure design","adaptation control mechanism","MIMO-OFDM systems","wireless communication service reliability","multimedia services","link adaptation techniques","data transmission","spectrum efficiency improvement","spatial multiplexing","closed-looped control mechanism","Monte Carlo simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive","MIMO","OFDM","Frame-structure","Doppler Shift"]}],"abstract":"With growing demand for large data rate and high reliability wireless communication services, such as multimedia services, link adaptation techniques have emerged as powerful tools for their significant transmission data rate increase, reliability enhancement and spectrum efficiency improvement.

Parallel interference cancellation (PIC) is introduced and a hybrid OSIC/PIC detection algorithm for V-BLAST systems is proposed in this paper. Only P layers' signals instead of all the layers' signals are detected using OSIC method first, and then the output signals after the interference cancellation pass through a PIC detector with low complexity and small delay. It is shown that the proposed detection algorithm can lower the computational complexity without performance loss when the parameter P is appropriately chosen and the computational complexity can be reduced greatly within tolerable BER performance degradation by choosing a smaller P. Moreover, it is more suitable for V- BLAST systems with a larger number of antennas.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4469306","publicationTitle":"2007 Second International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Second International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/4469305/4469306/04469596.pdf","endPage":"1177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid OSIC/PIC detection algorithm for V-BLAST systems","doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469596","startPage":"1174","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid OSIC/PIC detection algorithm for V-BLAST systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469596/","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2008","accessionNumber":"9836126","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4469596/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid OSIC/PIC detection algorithm for V-BLAST systems","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"CHINACOM-00-290.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056103S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4469305","isNumber":"4469306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4469305","xplore-issue":"4469306","articleId":"4469596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4469600,"authors":[{"name":"Do-Hyun Na","affiliation":["The Graduate School of Information Technology and Telecommunications, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Do-Hyun","lastName":"Na","id":"38116465700"},{"name":"Hao Nan","affiliation":["The Graduate School of Information Technology and Telecommunications, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Nan","id":"37684759000"},{"name":"Sang-Jo Yoo","affiliation":["The Graduate School of Information Technology and Telecommunications, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Jo","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37403379000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1009-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4469600","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":21,"totalDownloads":232},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469600","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chromium","Interference","FCC","Laboratories","Information technology","System performance","Protocols","Signal to noise ratio","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","WRAN","CR network","policy-based dynamic channel selection architecture","weighted selection","sequential selection","optimum channel","wireless regional area network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic Channel Selection","Policy Decision","Cognitive Network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469600","publicationTitle":"2007 Second International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Second International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","pdfPath":"/iel5/4469305/4469306/04469600.pdf","startPage":"1190","endPage":"1194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4469306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Policy-based Dynamic Channel Selection Architecture for Cognitive Radio Networks","abstract":"Recently, FCC has considered for that unlicensed device leases licensed devices' channel.

Thus, we propose a policy-based dynamic channel selection architecture for cognitive radio network to achieve an efficient communication. We propose three kinds of method for channel selection; the first one is weighted selection, the second one is sequential selection, and the last one is combined selection.

This approach is referred to as the generalized windowing method for transmultiplexers because after knowing the transmission channel a proper weighted sum of the inter-channel and inter-symbol interferences can be properly taken into account in the optimization of the window function, unlike in other existing windowing techniques. The proposed approach has also the following two advantages. First, independent of the number of subchannels and the common order of the subchannel filters, the number of unknowns is only four. Second, the overall optimization procedure is made considerably fast by estimating the above-mentioned sum in terms of two novel measures, namely, the signal to inter-symbol and the signal to inter-channel interferences, which are very easy to evaluate. Furthermore, when the transmission channel is not considered in the design, a table is provided, which contains the parameters for designing the prototype filter directly by using the windowing method without any time-consuming optimization. When comparing the resulting transmultiplexers with the corresponding perfect-reconstruction designs (the same number of subchannels and same prototype filter order), the levels of interferences are practically the same. However, when the system is affected by a strong narrowband interference, the proposed transmultiplexers outperform their PR counterparts. Design examples are included illustrating the efficiency of the proposed design approach over other existing techniques based on the use of the windowing method.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.920095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4663192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.920095","endPage":"2706","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4663192/04469659.pdf","startPage":"2696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Generalized Window Approach for Designing Transmultiplexers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469659/","displayDocTitle":"A Generalized Window Approach for Designing Transmultiplexers","volume":"55","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"10347972","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4469659/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Generalized Window Approach for Designing Transmultiplexers","sourcePdf":"55tcsi09-martinmartin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130471S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4663192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4663192","articleId":"4469659","onlineDate":"07 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4469660,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Power","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4663192/4469660/4469660-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Martin Power received the B.Eng. degree in electronic engineering from the University of Limerick, Ireland, in 2003.","He is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Limerick, in the area of data detection for multitrack magnetic storage.

There is a tradeoff between power consumption and system performance when searching for the optimum wordlength.

The receiver dynamically changes the wordlength on the basis of the conditions in the propagation environment while satisfying the user-required communication quality. That is, the system optimizes the wordlength while operating by sensing its own performance and gradually adjusting this wordlength to improve performance.

The quasi-1-D theories developed by Zener in 1937, and subsequently improved by Lifshitz and Roukes in 2000, are now widely used in MEMS design. This paper presents an exact theory for TED with 2-D heat conduction that enables a detailed evaluation of the accuracy of the quasi-1-D theories. A Green's function method is used to solve the 2-D heat- conduction equation, and an expression for TED is derived in the form of an infinite series. The effects of beam geometry, length-to- thickness aspect ratio, natural frequency, flexural mode shapes, and structural boundary conditions on TED are investigated for the representative case of single-crystal silicon microbeam resonators. The errors in the exact quasi-1-D theory range from 2% to 80% depending upon the aspect ratio and the mode shape. Implications for the use of the quasi-1-D and 2-D theories in MEMS design are discussed.

The bonded Cu surfaces were prepared by diamond bit cutting from electroplated structures. The electrical yield of bump chains depends on bonding temperature and bump size. At bonding temperatures of 300\u00b0C and over, bumps of 15 and of 20 \u03bcm diameter are bonded with high yield. Below 300\u00b0C, the yield decreases strongly for the larger bumps. However, chains made up of 15 \u03bcm bumps show high yield when bonded at 250 or 230\u00b0C, and still show 70% yield when bonded at 210\u00b0C. The electrical resistance of the bonded interface was too small to be determined separately. In shear testing, failure of the bumps does not occur at the bonded interface but after strong plastic deformation or as delamination of another interface.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 9th Electronics Packaging Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4455348/4469670/04469706.pdf","startPage":"315","endPage":"318","publicationTitle":"2007 9th Electronics Packaging Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/EPTC.2007.4469706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPTC.2007.4469706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4469670","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469706","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cu-Cu Bonding Alternative to Solder based Micro-Bumping","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Planarization","Wafer bonding","Testing","Atmospheric measurements","Temperature dependence","Electric resistance","Plastics","Delamination","Stacking","Conductive adhesives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["copper","cutting","diamond","electroplating","lead bonding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermo-compression bonds","diamond bit cutting","electroplated structures","electrical yield","bump chains","electrical resistance","shear testing","bumps failure","plastic deformation","interface delamination","temperature 210 C","size 15 mum","temperature 300 C","temperature 230 C","temperature 250 C","Cu"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469706/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Cu-Cu Bonding Alternative to Solder based Micro-Bumping","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4469706/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9863279","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2008","conferenceDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cu-Cu Bonding Alternative to Solder based Micro-Bumping","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"EPTC-00-36.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041937S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4455348","isNumber":"4469670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4455348","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4469670","articleId":"4469706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4469747,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyun Cui","affiliation":["Wolfson School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK"],"firstName":"Xiaoyun","lastName":"Cui","id":"37871849800"},{"name":"Deepa Bhatt","affiliation":["Wolfson School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK"],"firstName":"Deepa","lastName":"Bhatt","id":"38097184500"},{"name":"David A.

However, in order to realize such substrates, metallization is required to form conductive tracks and pads. In this work, electroless copper was used due to its relatively low cost, fast speed and potential for high volume production. Silanisation of the glass surfaces with (3-aminopropyl) trimethoxysilane (APTS) was used to provide a surface-coupled layer of functional molecules to assist in the adhesion of Pd/Sn catalyst and the subsequent copper deposition. The composition and microstructure of the modified glass surfaces were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Tape peel testing was used to qualitatively assess the adhesion of the copper to the smooth glass surface. For layers less than 150 nm thick, adhesion was good, but thicker coatings tended to peel away easily. Preliminary analysis of the peeled surfaces indicated that failure occurred at the interface between the copper and the catalyst. As an alternative approach for improving adhesion, laser machining was used to roughen the glass and direct the deposition of electroless copper, such that circuit patterns with good adhesion were formed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 9th Electronics Packaging Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4455348/4469670/04469747.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"42","publicationTitle":"2007 9th Electronics Packaging Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/EPTC.2007.4469747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPTC.2007.4469747","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4469670","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469747","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Copper Deposition and Patterning for Glass Substrate Manufacture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Copper","Glass manufacturing","Adhesives","Atomic force microscopy","Rough surfaces","Surface roughness","Conducting materials","Optical materials","Optical interconnections","Metallization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adhesion","atomic force microscopy","copper","electroless deposition","glass manufacture","integrated circuit interconnections","laser beam machining","metallisation","optical interconnections","organic compounds","X-ray photoelectron spectra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["copper deposition","glass substrate manufacture","patterning","high density interconnect","metallization","electroless copper","silanisation","(3-aminopropyl) trimethoxysilane","X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy","atomic force microscopy","XPS","AFM","tape peel testing","laser machining","Cu"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469747/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Copper Deposition and Patterning for Glass Substrate Manufacture","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4469747/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9863316","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2008","conferenceDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Copper Deposition and Patterning for Glass Substrate Manufacture","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"EPTC-00-77.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047811S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4455348","isNumber":"4469670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4455348","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4469670","articleId":"4469747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4469750,"authors":[{"name":"Deepa Bhatt","affiliation":["Wolfson School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK"],"firstName":"Deepa","lastName":"Bhatt","id":"38097184500"},{"name":"Karen Williams","affiliation":["Wolfson School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK"],"firstName":"Karen","lastName":"Williams","id":"37271307600"},{"name":"David A.

Since glass is extremely brittle, micromachining of thin glass substrates to create microvias and tracks is a significant challenge for which laser machining technologies offer a potential solution. This work aims to optimize and characterize the process of microvia drilling in 50-100 \u03bcm thick CMZ glass using a KrF excimer laser (wavelength = 248 nm: pulse length = 34 ns). The effect of various laser process parameters: pulse energy, pulse repetition rate and irradiation time on the geometry, debris and remelt formation of the microvias were studied. Through-hole drilling of 100 \u25fbm diameter (entry hole) microvias was achieved successfully at a fluence (energy density) of 3 J/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n with repetition rates as low as 20 Hz within 20 s, giving a taper profile of 19-24\u00b0. Microvia drilling was improved by adjusting the optical set-up to increase the fluence to 4.5 J/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n which reduced the taper angle to 14&#c000B0; giving an exit hole diameter of around 50 \u03bcm. It was possible to achieve through hole microvias with smaller diameters down to 40 \u03bcm in 50 \u03bcm thick glass. Debris and remelt formation around microvias was a key issue which was minimized by using a protective layer coating on the glass. In addition to laser operating parameters, laser beam intensity distribution also strongly influenced the microvia drilling process.","doi":"10.1109/EPTC.2007.4469750","publicationTitle":"2007 9th Electronics Packaging Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 9th Electronics Packaging Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4455348/4469670/04469750.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPTC.2007.4469750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4469670","startPage":"196","endPage":"201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Process Optimisation and Characterization of Excimer Laser Drilling of Microvias in Glass","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469750","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Process Optimisation and Characterization of Excimer Laser Drilling of Microvias in Glass","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469750/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9863319","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4469750/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Process Optimisation and Characterization of Excimer Laser Drilling of Microvias in Glass","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"EPTC-00-80.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066097S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4455348","isNumber":"4469670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4455348","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4469670","articleId":"4469750","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4469814,"authors":[{"name":"Michelle Chew","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Singapore"],"firstName":"Michelle","lastName":"Chew","id":"37298262200"},{"name":"Ling Xie","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Xie","id":"37274139800"},{"name":"CS Premachandran","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Singapore"],"firstName":"CS","lastName":"Premachandran","id":"37298280200"},{"name":"Seung Wook Yoon","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Singapore"],"firstName":"Seung Wook","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37292014000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1324-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1323-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4469814","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"abstract":"A disposable microfluidic cartridge for DNA/RNA extraction has been developed. Different reagents are used to bind and unbind DNA on the chip used in the cartridge. The extraction of DNA/RNA is based on a particular protocol, which involves the dispensing of different reagents at various flow rates. Dispensing of reagents is controlled by a needle valve which is integrated in the reservoir. With the help of an external actuator the fluid is dispensed to the chip and to the output collector. The flow rate of the fluid is controlled by the speed of the actuator. Protocol cycle time reduction is tried by changing the insert material and the design of the needle plug. Characterization studies for the thin membrane of the needle plug which is between the reservoir and fluidic channel are conducted using PDMS (poly-dimethylsiloxane) and rubber in combination of other materials. PDMS thin membrane is highly elastic and it takes a long time to break and open the valve. Thus, rubber with a combination of other materials is tested to reduce the time to break the membrane and open the valve to release the fluid from the reservoir to the chip. With modified needle plug the cycle time is reduced by about 16 mins.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 9th Electronics Packaging Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4455348/4469670/04469814.pdf","startPage":"411","endPage":"415","publicationTitle":"2007 9th Electronics Packaging Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/EPTC.2007.4469814","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPTC.2007.4469814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4469670","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469814","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Protocol Cycle Time Optimization on a Microfluidic Cartridge for DNA/RNA Extraction Application","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Microfluidics","DNA","RNA","Needles","Valves","Reservoirs","Conducting materials","Plugs","Biomembranes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological techniques","bioMEMS","DNA","electronics packaging","microfluidics","molecular biophysics","polymer films","rubber","valves"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protocol cycle time optimization","disposable microfluidic cartridge","DNA-RNA extraction application","needle plug design","poly-dimethylsiloxane","PDMS thin membrane","rubber","disposable polymer package"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469814/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Protocol Cycle Time Optimization on a Microfluidic Cartridge for DNA/RNA Extraction Application","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4469814/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9863383","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2008","conferenceDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Protocol Cycle Time Optimization on a Microfluidic Cartridge for DNA/RNA Extraction Application","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"EPTC-00-144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11294S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4455348","isNumber":"4469670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4455348","xplore-issue":"4469670","articleId":"4469814","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4469826,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Therefore, designing classifiers that use as few labeled data points as possible is highly desirable. Existing approaches typically make use of small-sample techniques and semisupervision to deal with the lack of labeled data. In this paper, we propose an active learning technique that efficiently updates existing classifiers by using fewer labeled data points than semisupervised methods. Further, unlike semisupervised methods, our proposed technique is well suited for learning or adapting classifiers when there is substantial change in the spectral signatures between labeled and unlabeled data. Thus, our active learning approach is also useful for classifying a series of spatially/temporally related images, wherein the spectral signatures vary across the images. Our interleaved semisupervised active learning method was tested on both single and spatially/temporally related hyperspectral data sets. We present empirical results that establish the superior performance of our proposed approach versus other active learning and semisupervised methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4475343/04469868.pdf","startPage":"1231","endPage":"1242","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2007.910220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2007.910220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475343","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Active Learning Approach to Hyperspectral Data Classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Hyperspectral sensors","Training data","Machine learning","Machine learning algorithms","Learning systems","Testing","Remote sensing","Taxonomy","Statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","geophysical signal processing","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active learning","hyperspectral data classification","training data","land cover classification","remotely sensed data","small-sample techniques","semisupervision","image classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active learning","hierarchical classifier","multitemporal data","semisupervised classifiers","spatially separate data"]},{"kwd":["Active learning","hierarchical classifier","multitemporal data","semisupervised classifiers","spatially separate data"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"An Active Learning Approach to Hyperspectral Data Classification","volume":"46","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4469868/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920361","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Active Learning Approach to Hyperspectral Data Classification","sourcePdf":"46tgrs04-rajan-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08343S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4475343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"226","xplore-issue":"4475343","articleId":"4469868","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4469869,"authors":[{"name":"Gareth J.

This paper describes the development of a fire detection and characterization algorithm for generating high temporal resolution African pyrogenic emission data sets using data from the geostationary spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager (SEVIRI). The algorithm builds on a prototype approach tested previously with preoperational SEVIRI data and utilizes both spatial and spectral detection methods whose thresholds adapt contextually within and between imaging slots. Algorithm validation is carried out via comparison to data from ~800 temporally coincident moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) scenes, and performance is significantly improved over the prior algorithm version, particularly in terms of detecting low fire radiative power (FRP) signals. On a per-fire basis, SEVIRI shows a good agreement with MODIS in terms of FRP measurement, with a small (3.7 MW) bias. In comparison to regional-scale total FRP derived from MODIS, SEVIRI underestimates this by, on average, 40% to 50% due to the nondetection of many low-intensity fire pixels (FRP < 50 MW). Frequency-magnitude analysis can be used to adjust fire radiative energy estimates for this effect, and taking this and other adjustments into account, SEVIRI-derived fuel consumption estimates for southern Africa from July to October 2004 are 259-339 Tg, with emission intensity peaking after midday and reducing by more than an order of magnitude each night.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fire Detection and Fire Characterization Over Africa Using Meteosat SEVIRI","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2008.915751","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4475343/04469869.pdf","startPage":"1200","endPage":"1218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.915751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475343","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469869","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469869/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","displayDocTitle":"Fire Detection and Fire Characterization Over Africa Using Meteosat SEVIRI","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4469869/","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920362","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fire Detection and Fire Characterization Over Africa Using Meteosat SEVIRI","sourcePdf":"46tgrs04-roberts-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061727S","chronDate":"April  2008","isNumber":"4475343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"145","articleId":"4469869","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":4469891,"authors":[{"name":"Huai-Ning Wu","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beijing Aeronautics and Astronautics University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/4481139/4469891/4469891-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huai-Ning Wu was born in Anhui, China, on November 15, 1972.

We consider these questions from a networking standpoint assuming point-to-point links, and employ a rigorous physical layer model to model conflict relationships between them. Since we seek capacity results, we assume that the network is operated using an appropriate schedule of conflict-free link activations. We develop and investigate a novel optimization framework to determine the optimal throughput and configuration, i.e., flow routes, link activation schedules and physical layer parameters. Determining the optimal throughput is a computationally hard problem, in general. However, using a smart enumerative technique we obtain numerical results for several different scenarios of interest. We obtain several important insights into the structure of the optimal routes, schedules and physical layer parameters. Besides determining the achievable throughput, we believe that our optimization-based framework can also be used as a tool, for configuring scheduled wireless networks, such as those based on IEEE 802.16.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput-Optimal Configuration of Fixed Wireless Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2007.909717","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/4652251/04469909.pdf","startPage":"1161","endPage":"1174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2007.909717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4652251","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469909","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469909/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Throughput-Optimal Configuration of Fixed Wireless Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4469909/","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10265518","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput-Optimal Configuration of Fixed Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"16tnet05-karnik.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129267S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"4652251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"4652251","articleId":"4469909","onlineDate":"12 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4469911,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Networks and Distributed Systems Laboratory, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/4652251/4469911/4469911-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Wang (S'07) received the B.Eng. and M.Sc. degrees in electronics science and engineering from Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, in 1997 and 2000, respectively.

The mobile relays have more energy than the static sensors. They can dynamically move around the network and help relieve sensors that are heavily burdened by high network traffic, thus extending the latter's lifetime. We first study the performance of a large dense network with one mobile relay and show that network lifetime improves over that of a purely static network by up to a factor of four. Also, the mobile relay needs to stay only within a two-hop radius of the sink. We then construct a joint mobility and routing algorithm which can yield a network lifetime close to the upper bound. The advantage of this algorithm is that it only requires a limited number of nodes in the network to be aware of the location of the mobile relay. Our simulation results show that one mobile relay can at least double the network lifetime in a randomly deployed WSN. By comparing the mobile relay approach with various static energy-provisioning methods, we demonstrate the importance of node mobility for resource provisioning in a WSN.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2007.906663","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/4652251/04469911.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2007.906663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4652251","startPage":"1108","endPage":"1120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extending the Lifetime of Wireless Sensor Networks Through Mobile Relays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469911","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Extending the Lifetime of Wireless Sensor Networks Through Mobile Relays","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469911/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10265526","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4469911/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extending the Lifetime of Wireless Sensor Networks Through Mobile Relays","sourcePdf":"16tnet05-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077483S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"4652251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"4652251","articleId":"4469911","onlineDate":"12 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4469913,"authors":[{"name":"David de Andres","affiliation":["Fault Tolerant Systems Group (GSTF), Technical University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4475221/4469913/4469913-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["David de Andr\u00e9s received the M.S. degree in computer science and the Ph.D. degree in computer architecture and technology from the Technical University of Valencia (UPV), Valencia, Spain, in 1998 and 2007, respectively.","In 1998, he joined the Fault Tolerant Systems Research Group (GSTF), UPV, where he is currently an Assistant Professor with the Computer Engineering Department (DISCA).

The dependability assessment of VLSI critical systems is a hot topic that requires further research. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been recently pro posed as a means for speeding-up the fault injection process in VLSI systems models (fault emulation) and for reducing the cost of fixing any error due to their applicability in the first steps of the development cycle. However, only a reduced set of fault models, mainly stuck-at and bit-flip, have been considered in fault emulation approaches. This paper describes the procedures to inject a wide set of faults representative of deep-submicrometer technology, like stuck-at, bit-flip, pulse, indetermination, stuck-open, delay, short, open-line, and bridging, using the best suitable FPGA- based technique. This paper also sets some basic guidelines for comparing VLSI systems in terms of their availability and safety, which is mandatory in mission and safety critical application contexts. This represents a step forward in the dependability benchmarking of VLSI systems and towards the definition of a framework for their evaluation and comparison in terms of performance, power consumption, and dependability.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.917428","startPage":"422","endPage":"431","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4475221/04469913.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.917428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Emulation for Dependability Evaluation of VLSI Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Emulation","Very large scale integration","Field programmable gate arrays","Safety","Semiconductor device manufacture","Costs","Delay","Guidelines","Availability","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic engineering computing","fault diagnosis","fault tolerant computing","field programmable gate arrays","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault emulation","dependability evaluation","VLSI systems","fault occurrence","field-programmable gate arrays","fault injection process","deep-submicrometer technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault injection","field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)","run-time reconfiguration","validation of VLSI circuits"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469913/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","displayDocTitle":"Fault Emulation for Dependability Evaluation of VLSI Systems","volume":"16","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4469913/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","accessionNumber":"9920539","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Emulation for Dependability Evaluation of VLSI Systems","sourcePdf":"16tvlsi04-deandres.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066928S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4475221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4475221","articleId":"4469913","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4469917,"authors":[{"name":"Banit Agrawal","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4490005/4469917/4469917-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Banit Agrawal (S'03) received the B.

While advanced algorithms exist to speed these search primitives on network processors and even custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), achieving tight bounds on worst case performance with standard memories often requires a very careful analysis of all possible access patterns. An alternative, and often times more simple solution, is possible if a ternary CAM (TCAM) is used to perform a fully parallel search across the entire data set. Unfortunately, this parallelism means that large portions of the chip are switching during each cycle, causing large amounts of power to be consumed. While researchers at all levels of design (from algorithms to circuits) have begun to explore new ways of managing the power consumption, quantifying design alternatives is difficult due to a lack of available models. In this paper, we examine the structure of a modern TCAM and present a simple, yet accurate, power and delay model. We present techniques to estimate the dynamic power consumption and leakage power of a TCAM structure and validate the model using a combination of industrial TCAM datasheets and prior published works. Such a model is a critical first step in bridging the intellectual divide between circuit-level and algorithm-level optimizations. To demonstrate the utility of our model, we present an extensive analysis of the model by varying various architectural parameters and describe how our model can be easily extended to handle several circuit optimizations in the TCAM structure. In addition, we present a comparative study of SRAM and TCAM energy consumption to directly quantify the many design options which will be very useful for network designers to explore various power management schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.917538","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4490005/04469917.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.917538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4490005","startPage":"554","endPage":"564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ternary CAM Power and Delay Model: Extensions and Uses","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469917","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ternary CAM Power and Delay Model: Extensions and Uses","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469917/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9921491","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4469917/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ternary CAM Power and Delay Model: Extensions and Uses","sourcePdf":"16tvlsi05-agrawal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075653S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4490005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"4490005","articleId":"4469917","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4469920,"authors":[{"name":"Daniele Rossi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4490005/4469920/4469920-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daniele Rossi (M'04) received the Laurea degree in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering and computer science from the University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy, in 2001 and 2005, respectively.","Since April 2005, he has been working as a Research Fellow at the same university.

Error-correcting codes (ECCs) can be employed in order to provide signal transmission with the necessary data integrity. In this paper, the impact of ECCs to encode the information on a very deep submicrometer bus on bus power consumption is analyzed. To fulfill this purpose, both the bus wires (with mutual capacitances, drivers, repeaters and receivers) and the encoding-decoding circuitry are accounted for. After a detailed analysis of power dissipation in deep submicrometer fault-tolerant busses using Hamming single ECCs, it is shown that no power saving is possible by choosing among different Hamming codes. A novel scheme, called dual rail, is then proposed. It is shown that dual rail, combined with a proper bus layout, can provide a reduction of energy consumption. In particular, it is shown how the passive elements of the bus (bottom and mutual wire capacitances), active elements of the bus (buffers) and error-correcting circuits contribute to power consumption, and how different tradeoffs can be achieved. The analysis presented in this paper has been performed considering a realistic bus structure, implemented in a standard 0.13-mum CMOS technology.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","Fault tolerance","Crosstalk","Capacitance","Rails","CMOS technology","Integrated circuit interconnections","Computer errors","Power supplies","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","error correction codes","fault tolerance","field buses","Hamming codes","integrated circuit interconnections","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant bus","on-chip interconnects","error-correcting codes","signal transmission","data integrity","submicrometer bus","bus power consumption","bus wires","encoding-decoding circuitry","power dissipation","Hamming single ECC","dual rail","bus layout","CMOS technology","size 0.13 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bus","error-correcting codes (ECCs)","fault tolerance","power consumption","signal integrity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469920","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.917535","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4490005/04469920.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.917535","startPage":"542","endPage":"553","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4490005","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Consumption of Fault Tolerant Busses","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power Consumption of Fault Tolerant Busses","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469920/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2008","volume":"16","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4469920/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9921499","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Consumption of Fault Tolerant Busses","sourcePdf":"16tvlsi05-rossi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114723S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4490005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4490005","articleId":"4469920","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4469928,"authors":[{"name":"Changjun Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Changjun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37539150600"},{"name":"Yang Pu","affiliation":["10th Institute, China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, Chengdu, China","Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Pu","id":"38120579900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"4469928","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":703},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"abstract":"A novel microstrip resonator is designed to measure complex permittivities of liquids with medium loss.

The thin-film substrate has the capability of integrated passive elements and flip-chip interconnection. Space-consuming components such as a microstrip Rotman lens and patch antennas are implemented on a low-loss, low-cost, and low-dielectric-constant material, benzocyclobutane. V-band monolithic microwave integrated circuits, a power amplifier, and a SP4T switch, are flip-chipped on the thin-film substrate while minimizing parasitic effects. The fabricated antenna module shows if-plane beam steering at four angles, plusmn6deg and plusmn20deg. The measured effective isotropic radiated power is in the range of 17.3-18 dBm. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a planar mm-wave beam-steering antenna module on a thin-film substrate incorporating integrated terminating loads and flip-chip interconnections.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2008.918966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4479593","startPage":"287","endPage":"289","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/4479593/04469934.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A V-Band Beam-Steering Antenna on a Thin-Film Substrate With a Flip-Chip Interconnection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469934/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4469934/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A V-Band Beam-Steering Antenna on a Thin-Film Substrate With a Flip-Chip Interconnection","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920826","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"18","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A V-Band Beam-Steering Antenna on a Thin-Film Substrate With a Flip-Chip Interconnection","sourcePdf":"18lmwc04-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058537S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"4479593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4479593","articleId":"4469934","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4469937,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Tzong Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical of Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Tzong","lastName":"Liu","id":"38129023700"},{"name":"Chung-Hao Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical of Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chung-Hao","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37536089500"},{"name":"Tzu-Wei Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical of Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tzu-Wei","lastName":"Han","id":"37953522900"},{"name":"Tzong-Lin Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical of Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tzong-Lin","lastName":"Wu","id":"37275978200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"4469937","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":150,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":2677},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filters","Crosstalk","Electromagnetic interference","Circuit noise","Etching","Cables","Signal design","Frequency","Digital circuits","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","interference suppression","noise","signal processing","transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded common-mode suppression filter","GHz differential signals","periodic defected ground plane","low-cost filter design","common-mode noise suppression","high-speed differential signal","defected ground structure","transmission-line model","full-wave simulation","signal integrity","noise figure 20 dB","frequency 3.3 GHz to 5.7 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Common-mode filter","defected ground plane","differential signal","electromagnetic interference (EMI)","signal integrity"]}],"abstract":"A novel low-cost filter design for common-mode noise suppression in high-speed differential signals is proposed.

It is found that over 20 dB suppression of common-mode noise can be achieved over a wide frequency range from 3.3 to 5.7 GHz with 3 cascaded DGS cells, while the differential signals still keep good signal integrity in eye-pattern observation. The common-mode current, which generally results in common-mode EMI, on the attached input/output cable is also proved to be efficiently suppressed (15 dB in average) within the stopband by the proposed filter.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Embedded Common-Mode Suppression Filter for GHz Differential Signals Using Periodic Defected Ground Plane","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2008.918883","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/4479593/04469937.pdf","startPage":"248","endPage":"250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2008.918883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4479593","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469937","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469937/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","displayDocTitle":"An Embedded Common-Mode Suppression Filter for GHz Differential Signals Using Periodic Defected Ground Plane","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4469937/","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920829","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Embedded Common-Mode Suppression Filter for GHz Differential Signals Using Periodic Defected Ground Plane","sourcePdf":"18lmwc04-liu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034896S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"4479593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"150","xplore-issue":"4479593","articleId":"4469937","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":4469938,"authors":[{"name":"Vesna Radisic","affiliation":["Northrop Grumman Corporation, Redondo Beach, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Vesna","lastName":"Radisic","id":"37296529400"},{"name":"Donald Sawdai","affiliation":["Northrop Grumman Corporation, Redondo Beach, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Donald","lastName":"Sawdai","id":"38338783600"},{"name":"Dennis Scott","affiliation":["Northrop Grumman Corporation, Redondo Beach, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Dennis","lastName":"Scott","id":"37270263200"},{"name":"William R.

A parabolic PDE system typically involves a spatial differential operator with eigenspectrum that can be partitioned into a finite-dimensional slow one and an infinite-dimensional stable fast complement. Motivated by this, in the proposed control scheme, Galerkin method is initially applied to the PDE system to derive an ordinary differential equation (ODE) system with unknown nonlinearities, which accurately describes the dynamics of the dominant (slow) modes of the PDE system. The resulting nonlinear ODE system is subsequently parameterized by a multilayer neural network (MNN) with one-hidden layer and zero bias terms. Then, based on the neural model and a Lure-type Lyapunov function, a linear modal feedback controller is developed to stabilize the closed-loop PDE system and provide an upper bound for the quadratic cost function associated with the finite-dimensional slow system for all admissible approximation errors of the network. The outcome of the GCC problem is formulated as a linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem. Moreover, by using the existing LMI optimization technique, a suboptimal guaranteed cost controller in the sense of minimizing the cost bound is obtained. Finally, the proposed design method is applied to the control of the temperature profile of a catalytic rod.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2007.912592","startPage":"795","endPage":"807","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2007.912592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4505376","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4505376/04469946.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Galerkin/Neural-Network-Based Design of Guaranteed Cost Control for Nonlinear Distributed Parameter Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469946/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Galerkin/Neural-Network-Based Design of Guaranteed Cost Control for Nonlinear Distributed Parameter Systems","volume":"19","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4469946/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9944443","pubMedId":"18467209","publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Galerkin/Neural-Network-Based Design of Guaranteed Cost Control for Nonlinear Distributed Parameter Systems","sourcePdf":"19tnn05-hwu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103645S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4505376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4505376","articleId":"4469946","onlineDate":"12 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":4469949,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) associative memory network is a computational model inspired by the neurophysiological properties of the cerebellum, and it has been widely used for control, optimization, and various pattern recognition tasks. However, the CMAC network's highly regularized computing structure often leads to the following: (1) a suboptimal modeling accuracy, (2) poor memory utilization, and (3) the generalization-accuracy dilemma. Previous attempts to address these shortcomings have limited success and the proposed solutions often introduce a high operational complexity to the CMAC network. This paper presents a novel neurophysiologically inspired associative memory architecture named pseudo-self-evolving CMAC (PSECMAC) that nonuniformly allocates its computing cells to overcome the architectural deficiencies encountered by the CMAC network. The nonuniform memory allocation scheme employed by the proposed PSECMAC network is inspired by the cerebellar experience-driven synaptic plasticity phenomenon observed in the cerebellum, where significantly higher densities of synaptic connections are located in the frequently accessed regions. In the PSECMAC network, this biological synaptic plasticity phenomenon is emulated by employing a data-driven adaptive memory quantization scheme that defines its computing structure. A neighborhood-based activation process is subsequently implemented to facilitate the learning and computation of the PSECMAC structure. The training stability of the PSECMAC network is theoretically assured by the proof of its learning convergence, which will be presented in this paper. The performance of the proposed network is subsequently bench- marked against the CMAC network and several representative CMAC variants on three real-life applications, namely, pricing of currency futures option, banking failure classification, and modeling of the glucose-insulin dynamics of the human glucose metabolic process. The experimental results have strongly demonstrated the effectiveness of the PSECMAC network in addressing the architectural deficiencies of the CMAC network by achieving significant improvements in the memory utilization, output accuracy as well as the generalization capability of the network.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4479602/04469949.pdf","startPage":"689","endPage":"712","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2007.912300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2007.912300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4479602","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469949","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PSECMAC: A Novel Self-Organizing Multiresolution Associative Memory Architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Associative memory","Memory architecture","Brain modeling","Computer networks","Computer architecture","Humans","Biology computing","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Computational modeling","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cerebellar model arithmetic computers","content-addressable storage","generalisation (artificial intelligence)","neural net architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PSECMAC","self-organizing multiresolution associative memory architecture","cerebellar model articulation controller","suboptimal modeling accuracy","poor memory utilization","pseudo-self-evolving CMAC","generalization capability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Associative memory","brain inspired","cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC)","cerebellum","learning convergence","multiresolution","neural networks","pseudo-self-evolving CMAC (PSECMAC)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Association Learning","Cerebellum","Cerebellum","Computer Simulation","Humans","Memory","Models, Neurological","Nerve Net","Neural Networks (Computer)","Neuronal Plasticity","Synapses"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469949/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"PSECMAC: A Novel Self-Organizing Multiresolution Associative Memory Architecture","volume":"19","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4469949/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920795","pubMedId":"18390313","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PSECMAC: A Novel Self-Organizing Multiresolution Associative Memory Architecture","sourcePdf":"19tnn04-teddy.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.27118S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4479602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4479602","articleId":"4469949","onlineDate":"12 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4469950,"authors":[{"name":"Stephan Trenn","affiliation":["Institute of Mathematics, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/4505376/4469950/4469950-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stephan Trenn was born in 1980.

It is found that Hopf bifurcation occurs when these parameters pass through some critical values where the conditions for local asymptotical stability of the equilibrium are not satisfied. By analyzing the characteristic equation and using the frequency domain method, the existence of Hopf bifurcation is proved. The stability of bifurcating periodic solutions is determined by the harmonic balance approach, Nyquist criterion, and graphic Hopf bifurcation theorem. Moreover, a critical condition is derived under which the stability is not guaranteed, thus a necessary and sufficient condition for ensuring the local asymptotical stability is well understood, and from which the essential dynamics of the delayed neural network are revealed. Finally, numerical results are given to verify the theoretical analysis, and some interesting phenomena are observed and reported.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2007.912589","startPage":"845","endPage":"854","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2007.912589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4505376","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4505376/04469951.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability and Hopf Bifurcation of a General Delayed Recurrent Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469951/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Stability and Hopf Bifurcation of a General Delayed Recurrent Neural Network","volume":"19","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4469951/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9960820","pubMedId":"18467213","publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability and Hopf Bifurcation of a General Delayed Recurrent Neural Network","sourcePdf":"19tnn05-yu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11473S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4505376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"4505376","articleId":"4469951","onlineDate":"12 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4469952,"authors":[{"name":"Huaguang Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Integrated Automation of Process Industry, Ministry of Education of China, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Huaguang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280792300"},{"name":"Zhanshan Wang","affiliation":["Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, CN"],"firstName":"Zhanshan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37291899000"},{"name":"Derong Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Derong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37277008500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"4469952","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":286,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":702},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Asymptotic stability","Recurrent neural networks","Neural networks","Linear matrix inequalities","Sufficient conditions","Delay effects","Associative memory","Differential equations","Delay lines","Information processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","delay systems","differential equations","functional equations","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods","neurocontrollers","recurrent neural nets","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global asymptotic stability","recurrent neural network","multiple time-varying delays","Lyapunov-Krasovskii stability","functional differential equations","linear matrix inequality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","global asymptotic stability","multiple time-varying delays","linear matrix inequality (LMI)","Lyapunov\u2013Krasovskii functional"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Acids","Algorithms","Linear Models","Neural Networks (Computer)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469952","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2007.912319","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","abstract":"In this paper, several sufficient conditions are established for the global asymptotic stability of recurrent neural networks with multiple time-varying delays.

Navier-Stokes and energy equations for laminar flow and conjugate heat transfer are solved using a finite volume solver. Solutions are first carefully validated with available analytical and experimental results; the shape of the micro-channel is then optimized using surrogate methods. Ratios of the width of the micro-channel to the depth and the width of the fin to the depth are selected as design variables. Design points are selected through a four-level full factorial design. A single objective function thermal resistance, formulated using pumping power as a constraint, is optimized. Mass flow rate is adjusted by the constant pumping power constraint. Response surface approximation, kriging, and radial basis neural network methods are applied to construct surrogates and the optimum point is searched by sequential quadratic programming.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469969/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4469969/","dateOfInsertion":"28 May 2008","accessionNumber":"10006172","volume":"31","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Shape Optimization of Micro-Channel Heat Sink for Micro-Electronic Cooling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shape Optimization of Micro-Channel Heat Sink for Micro-Electronic Cooling","sourcePdf":"31tcapt02-husain.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08502S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"6144","isNumber":"4531641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6144","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"4531641","articleId":"4469969","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4469975,"authors":[{"name":"Cleon E.

The ADC system achieves a signal-to-noise and distortion ratio of 59.6 dB at 5 MHz and 50.1 dB at 350 MHz after calibration.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2008.918970","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/4475716/04469987.pdf","startPage":"234","endPage":"238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2008.918970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Background Sample-Time Error Calibration Technique Using Random Data for Wide-Band High-Resolution Time-Interleaved ADCs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469987","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469987/","displayDocTitle":"A Background Sample-Time Error Calibration Technique Using Random Data for Wide-Band High-Resolution Time-Interleaved ADCs","volume":"55","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9920329","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4469987/","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Background Sample-Time Error Calibration Technique Using Random Data for Wide-Band High-Resolution Time-Interleaved ADCs","sourcePdf":"55tcsii03-haftbaradaran.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149362S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"4475716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4475716","articleId":"4469987","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4469988,"authors":[{"name":"Chien-Jung Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chien-Jung","lastName":"Li","id":"37278186200"},{"name":"Chi-Tsan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Tsan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37578935100"},{"name":"Tzyy-Sheng Horng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tzyy-Sheng","lastName":"Horng","id":"37266311200"},{"name":"Je-Kuan Jau","affiliation":["Information and Communications Laboratories, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Je-Kuan","lastName":"Jau","id":"37284025300"},{"name":"Jian-Yu Li","affiliation":["Information and Communications Laboratories, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jian-Yu","lastName":"Li","id":"37440666000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"4469988","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":670},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Transmitters","Digital modulation","Phase modulation","Voltage","RF signals","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Signal processing","Power amplifiers","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modulators","power amplifiers","radio transmitters","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimode wireless RF transmitter","hybrid quadrature polar modulator","power amplifier","transmit efficiency","class-E design","RF modulated carrier","class-S modulator","supply-voltage signal","envelope variation","double envelope modulation","digital predistorter","HQPM-based transmitter","adjacent channel power rejection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Class-E power amplifier (PA)","Class-S modulator","digital predistorter","wireless RF transmitter"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a hybrid quadrature polar modulator (HQPM) to drive the power amplifier (PA) highly efficiently in a wireless RF transmitter required for multimode operation. For enhancing the transmit efficiency, a switching-mode PA realized as Class-E design is used in the transmitter. The HQPM consists of a quadrature modulator for processing the RF modulated carrier and a Class-S modulator for processing the supply-voltage signal. The quadrature modulator and the Class-S modulator deliver the output signals with proportional envelope variation before being inserted into the RF-input terminal and the supply-voltage terminal of a Class-E PA, respectively, causing the double envelope modulation to distort the modulated RF signal at the PA output. Therefore, a digital predistorter is embedded in the HQPM for compensation. The proposed HQPM-based transmitter can help reducing the average dc and input RF powers and the output feedthrough levels so as to enhance power added efficiency and adjacent channel power rejection remarkably.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Average-Efficiency Multimode RF Transmitter Using a Hybrid Quadrature Polar Modulator","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2008.918969","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/4475716/04469988.pdf","startPage":"249","endPage":"253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2008.918969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475716","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469988","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469988/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","displayDocTitle":"High Average-Efficiency Multimode RF Transmitter Using a Hybrid Quadrature Polar Modulator","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4469988/","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9920331","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Average-Efficiency Multimode RF Transmitter Using a Hybrid Quadrature Polar Modulator","sourcePdf":"55tcsii03-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071609S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"4475716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4475716","articleId":"4469988","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4469989,"authors":[{"name":"Hsin-Lei Lin","affiliation":["Wireless Broadband Technology Division, SoC Technology Center (STC), Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan","Electrical Engineering Department, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsin-Lei","lastName":"Lin","id":"37291991300"},{"name":"Robert C.

The first amplifier uses a simple inductive peaking technique for bandwidth extension, while the second design utilizes a two-stage approach with an added gain control feature. Both amplifiers achieve a flat bandwidth of more than 6 GHz and a gain of higher than 10 dB with supply voltages of 1.8-2.5 V. Designs with different metal thicknesses are compared.

The proposed adaptive voltage swing distribution method in multistack FETs is very effective in preventing unwanted channel formation with low control voltage supply in OFF-state FETs. This, in turn, increases power-handling capability when a large-signal voltage swing is applied. In the proposed CMOS switch, the behavior of the voltage swing in OFF-state multistack FETs shows a difference with respect to the level of input voltage swing. The characteristics of voltage swing distribution and leakage channel formation in the CMOS switch is fully analyzed with incorporation of the novel adaptive voltage swing distribution method into a three-stacked nMOS Rx switch in a standard 0.18-mum triple-well CMOS process. In addition, linearity of the proposed technique is verified through the measurement data of the single-pole double-throw switches that employ the proposed technique in the Rx switch. Two different types of configurations are implemented and characterized at the Rx switches, which consist of four-stacked nMOS devices, to demonstrate the method of minimizing voltage stress issues on one of the multistacked FETs. Layout consideration was also taken to prevent interference between leakage signals at the substrate. The measured performance of the proposed design shows an input 0.3-dB compression point of 33.5 dBm at 1.9 GHz. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest power-handling capability of a CMOS switch in a standard CMOS process ever reported. The insertion losses of the Tx and Rx switches are 1.6 and 1.9 dB, respectively, at 1.9 GHz. The isolation of the Tx and Rx switches is around 20 and 30 dB, respectively, at 1.9 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2008.919047","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4481203/04469996.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2008.919047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4481203","startPage":"849","endPage":"858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Power CMOS Switch Using A Novel Adaptive Voltage Swing Distribution Method in Multistack FETs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4469996","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A High-Power CMOS Switch Using A Novel Adaptive Voltage Swing Distribution Method in Multistack FETs","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469996/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 April 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920848","dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4469996/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Power CMOS Switch Using A Novel Adaptive Voltage Swing Distribution Method in Multistack FETs","sourcePdf":"56tmtt04-ahn.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052472S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4481203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4481203","articleId":"4469996","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4469999,"authors":[{"name":"Davide Resca","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Information and Systems, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4481203/4469999/4469999-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Davide Resca (S'05) was born in Bologna, Italy, in 1979.

In conventional approaches, the parasitic phenomena are described by a network of lumped elements. As an alternative, a distributed description can be conveniently adopted. This choice has been proven very appropriate when dealing with device scaling and very high operating frequencies. In this paper, a novel approach to distributed parasitic modeling is adopted for the very first time in association with a nonlinear electron device model. In particular, it is shown how an equivalent intrinsic device and a suitably defined distributed parasitic network can be accurately defined and modeled on the basis of standard measurements and easy electromagnetic simulations. Wide experimental validation based on GaAs pseudomorphic HEMTs is provided, showing accurate prediction capabilities both under small- and large-signal conditions. The proposed model is shown to perform optimally even after periphery scaling.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4469999/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4469999/","dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920867","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Scalable Nonlinear FET Model Based on a Distributed Parasitic Network Description","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable Nonlinear FET Model Based on a Distributed Parasitic Network Description","sourcePdf":"56tmtt04-resca.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136091S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4481203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4481203","articleId":"4469999","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"}]
