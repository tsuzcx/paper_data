Various effects such as thermal cooling and its impact on distribution of potential across IC at different conditions have been simulated using COMSOL Multiphysics with various architectures such as: (1) 3D IC structure with no fins and spreaders, (2) TTSV with fins and spreaders made of graphene, and (3) TTSV with fins and heat spreaders made of Carbon Nanotube (CNT). Our result yielded, CNT being better thermal cooling material compared to graphene of order greater than 100 K. Furthermore, finned structure with heat spreaders added an extra cooling advantage of the order greater than 400 K. But performance of graphene with fin structure is better as per signal integrity point of view. Conclusively thermal management can be improved efficiently with the above proposed 3D IC structures.","doi":"10.1109/3DIC.2016.7970000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7969992","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3DIC.2016.7970000","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International 3D Systems Integration Conference (3DIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International 3D Systems Integration Conference (3DIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7959775/7969992/07970000.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of graphene and CNT based finned TTSV and spreaders for thermal management in 3D IC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Nov. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of graphene and CNT based finned TTSV and spreaders for thermal management in 3D IC","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Nov. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7970000/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"17014116","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7970000/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of graphene and CNT based finned TTSV and spreaders for thermal management in 3D IC","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1570290606.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049306S","chronDate":"8-11 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7959775","isNumber":"7969992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7959775","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7969992","articleId":"7970000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7970012,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This paper introduces a 3D multilayer CMOS-RRAM accelerator for an incremental least-squares based learning on neural network. Given input of buffered data hold on the layer of a RRAM memory, intensive matrix-vector multiplication can be firstly accelerated on the layer of a digitized RRAM-crossbar. The remaining incremental leastsquares algorithmic operations for feature extraction and classifier training can be accelerated on the layer of CMOS ASIC, using an incremental Cholesky factorization accelerator realized with consideration of parallelism and pipeline. Experiment results have shown that such a 3D accelerator can significantly reduce training time with acceptable accuracy. Compared to 3D-CMOS-ASIC implementation, it can achieve 1.28x smaller area, 2.05x faster runtime and 12.4x energy reduction. Compared to GPU implementation, our work shows 3.07x speed-up and 162.86x energy-saving.","doi":"10.1109/3DIC.2016.7970014","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International 3D Systems Integration Conference (3DIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International 3D Systems Integration Conference (3DIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7959775/7969992/07970014.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3DIC.2016.7970014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7969992","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7970014","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 3D multi-layer CMOS-RRAM accelerator for neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Nov. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7970014/","displayDocTitle":"A 3D multi-layer CMOS-RRAM accelerator for neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7970014/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2017","conferenceDate":"8-11 Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"17014100","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 3D multi-layer CMOS-RRAM accelerator for neural network","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1570295011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088126S","chronDate":"8-11 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7959775","isNumber":"7969992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7959775","xplore-issue":"7969992","articleId":"7970014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7970018,"authors":[{"name":"William Wahby","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Wahby","id":"37086083979"},{"name":"Thomas Sarvey","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Sarvey","id":"37085338345"},{"name":"Hardik Sharma","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Georgia Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Hardik","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37085778200"},{"name":"Hadi Esmaeilzadeh","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Georgia Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Hadi","lastName":"Esmaeilzadeh","id":"37085567690"},{"name":"Muhannad S.

The overall large-scale system is assumed to consist of fuzzy subsystems with unknown but norm-bounded interconnections. This paper focuses mainly on the design of a sampled-data decentralized model reference tracking controller based on the exact discretization approach, by which the resulting large-scale error dynamics becomes asymptotically stabilized with a predefined H-infinity performance criterion. To this end, we first design a continuous-time decentralized tracking controller based on the proposed design technique. After that, by using the discrete-time fuzzy Lyapunov function, the proposed design technique is extended to cover a sampled-data tracking controller design. The proposed controller design techniques are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods by comparing them with other methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7970097/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7970097/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2017","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17124507","volume":"5","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Sampled-Data Tracking Control of Large-Scale Fuzzy Systems: An Exact Discretization Approach","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002573","fundingName":"Barun ICT Research Center at Yonsei University"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), Ministry of Education, through the Basic Science Research Program","grantNumber":"NRF-2016R1A6A1A03013567"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Korea Government (MEST)","grantNumber":"NRF-2015R1A2A2A05001610"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Decentralized Sampled-Data Tracking Control of Large-Scale Fuzzy Systems: An Exact Discretization Approach","sourcePdf":"access-park-2723982-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089368S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7970097","onlineDate":"06 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7970099,"authors":[{"name":"Prosanta Gope","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8059894/7970099/gope-2723915-small.gif","p":["Prosanta Gope received the M.Tech. degree in computer science and engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Durgapur, India, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science and information engineering from National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 2015.","He served over one year as a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow with the Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore.

It basically combines the mobile devices with the cloud computing. By the means of on-demand self-service and extendibility, it can offer the infrastructures, platform, entertainments, and software services in a cloud to MUs through the mobile network. However, offering secure access to these services by preserving the privacy of the MU is indeed a challenge for any mobile cloud service provider. In this paper, we aim to propose a new robust anonymous mutual authentication scheme for mobile cloud environment. Through this scheme, both the MU and the service cloud need to prove their legitimacy, and it eventually helps the legitimate mobile cloud user to enjoy n times all the ubiquitous services in a secure and efficient way, where the value of n may differ based on the principal he/she has paid for. The security of the proposed scheme is thoroughly analyzed using both formal as well as informal security analysis. Furthermore, functionality and performance comparisons using the testbed simulation among the proposed scheme and other existing relevant schemes reveal that the proposed scheme outperforms other existing schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Anonymous Mutual Authentication Scheme for <i>n</i>-Times Ubiquitous Mobile Cloud Computing Services","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2017.2723915","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8059894/07970099.pdf","startPage":"1764","endPage":"1772","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2017.2723915","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8059894","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7970099","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7970099/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Robust Anonymous Mutual Authentication Scheme for <i>n</i>-Times Ubiquitous Mobile Cloud Computing Services","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7970099/","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17282009","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Information Security Education Awareness Phase II Project, Deity, India","grantNumber":"L-14011/20/2014-HRD"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Anonymous Mutual Authentication Scheme for <italic>n</italic>-Times Ubiquitous Mobile Cloud Computing Services","sourcePdf":"jiot-gope-2723915-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085842S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8059894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8059894","articleId":"7970099","onlineDate":"06 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7970102,"authors":[{"name":"Yongjun Liu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Yongjun","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0003-1628-8865","id":"37086052634"},{"name":"Guisheng Liao","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Guisheng","lastName":"Liao","id":"37265079200"},{"name":"Jingwei Xu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Jingwei","lastName":"Xu","id":"38490240200"},{"name":"Zhiwei Yang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Zhiwei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086013969"},{"name":"Yuhong Zhang","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering School, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Yuhong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085871063"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7970102","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1997},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7970102","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar","OFDM","Frequency modulation","Resource management","Numerical models","Information rates","Radar antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","information theory","OFDM modulation","radar","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fixed waveform","adaptive OFDM integrated radar","communications waveform design","information theory","spectral resources","conditional mutual information","random target impulse response","data information rate","DIR","frequency selective fading channel","low transmit power","adaptive orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","integrated waveform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Transmit power adaptation","integrated radar and communications","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","conditional mutual information","data information rate"]}],"abstract":"To improve the effectiveness of limited spectral resources, an adaptive orthogonal frequency division multiplexing integrated radar and communications waveform design method is proposed. First, the conditional mutual information (MI) between the random target impulse response and the received signal, and the data information rate (DIR) of frequency selective fading channel are formulated. Then, with the constraint on the total power, the optimization problem, which simultaneously considers the conditional MI for radar and DIR for communications, is devised, and the analytic solution is derived. With low transmit power, the designed integrated waveform outperforms the fixed waveform (i.e., equal power allocation).

Many architectural limitations, such as weak security, data distribution efficiency, provenance and traceability of sources, excessive human intervention, lack of interoperability, and service-awareness in devices configuration, have been exposed and called the society attention. This paper addresses these limitations by properly integrating five strategies: 1) efficient IoT data exchanging, storage and processing via information-centric networking (ICN); 2) contract-based IoT services composition; 3) software-control/management of IoT devices accordingly to the services requirements; 4) naming and name resolution of the physical and virtual entities, proving identifier/locator splitting and contextualized self-organization; and 5) name-based routing and network caching. Considering the current state-of-the art, the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: proposal of a novel service-defined architecture (SDA), in which device configurations are a reflex of the real service needs (given by established contracts); combination of ICN benefits with named-services; and perennial identification of IoT devices, services, and data using self-verifiable naming. All integration work has been supported by a convergent architecture called NovaGenesis (NG), demonstrating its viability as an alternative for the current IoT architectures. A proof-of-concept prototype has been implemented in laboratory under real conditions. The experimental results indicate competitive performance in terms of data transfer, memory and CPU consumption. Embedded NG has smaller RAM and ROM requirements when compared to a similar RPL + 6LowPAN stack. Data exchanging has been performed in few milliseconds in a local area network.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Internet of Things","Security","Interoperability","Proposals","Context"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","Internet of Things","internetworking","IP networks","telecommunication switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["novel service-defined architecture","device configurations","ICN benefits","IoT devices","convergent architecture","current IoT architectures","local area network","architectural limitations","weak security","data distribution efficiency","service-awareness","devices configuration","society attention","information-centric networking","Internet","human intervention","NovaGenesis architecture","identifier-locator splitting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G","Future Internet (FI)","information-centric networking (ICN)","Internet of Things (IoT)","service-oriented architecture (SOA)","software-defined networking (SDN)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2017.2723953","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8651406/07970111.pdf","startPage":"215","endPage":"229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8651406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2017.2723953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advancing NovaGenesis Architecture Towards Future Internet of Things","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7970111","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Advancing NovaGenesis Architecture Towards Future Internet of Things","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7970111/","volume":"6","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/7970111/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18471453","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 July 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Finep/Funttel through the Radiocommunication Reference Center (Centro de Refer\u00eancia em Radicomunica\u00e7\u00f5es\u2014CRR) Project of the National Institute of Telecommunications (Instituto Nacional de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es), Brazil","grantNumber":"01.14.0231.00"},{"fundingName":"Government of Russian Federation","grantNumber":"074-U01"},{"fundingName":"National Funding from the FCT\u2014Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia","grantNumber":"UID/EEA/500008/2013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advancing NovaGenesis Architecture Towards Future Internet of Things","sourcePdf":"jiot-rodrigues-2723953-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096433S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8651406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8651406","articleId":"7970111","onlineDate":"06 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7970113,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Due to reality of economic, dc appliances and loads are usually low in cost and lack intelligence and communication features for effective monitoring and management. This paper proposes a smart sensor design for dc pico-grid with the use of a single sensor multiple loads and states detection in monitoring the \u201cdumb\u201d appliances. This eliminates the need to have intelligence and communication features for every appliance. With the smart sensor, several such smart dc pico-grids can be bundled into bigger scale of smart nano-grid or micro-grid. In addition to knowing how much energy or power the pico-grid is using, the smart sensor also provides load disaggregation and state-change detection. The states of the loads can be learned and detected via the signatures and features obtained from the transient state or the steady state of the entire grid's current waveform. Computational intelligence techniques, k-nearest neighbors, K-means clustering, and other algorithms are used in the system for loads classification and state-change detection. Working together with the software in the smart sensor is hardware implementation of low cost operational amplifiers and logic gates; these hardware help to share the burden on the controller and release resources for the controller to perform more advanced processes. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the operation of the smart sensor in dc pico-grid.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2017.2723925","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/8103835/07970113.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2017.2723925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8103835","startPage":"7775","endPage":"7783","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart Sensing of Loads in an Extra Low Voltage DC Pico-Grid Using Machine Learning Techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7970113","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Smart Sensing of Loads in an Extra Low Voltage DC Pico-Grid Using Machine Learning Techniques","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1, 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7970113/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 July 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"23","publicationDate":"1 Dec.1, 2017","accessionNumber":"17340012","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7970113/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart Sensing of Loads in an Extra Low Voltage DC Pico-Grid Using Machine Learning Techniques","sourcePdf":"jsen-quek-2723925-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090424S","chronDate":"Dec.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"8103835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8103835","articleId":"7970113","onlineDate":"06 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7970114,"authors":[{"name":"Amin Alizadeh Naeini","affiliation":["Department of Geomatics Engineering, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Amin","lastName":"Alizadeh Naeini","orcid":"0000-0001-7578-6245","id":"37086114275"},{"name":"Sayyed Hamed Alizadeh Moghaddam","affiliation":["Faculty of Geodesy and Geomatics Engineering, K.

These problems degrade the accuracy of extracted spatial information from very high spatial resolution (VHSR) satellite images. This study particularly focused on overcoming the over-fitting problem through an optimal term selection approach. To this end, multiobjective genetic algorithm was used in order to optimize three effective objective functions: the RMSE of ground control points (GCPs), the number, and the distribution of both RPCs and GCPs. Finally, the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution, as an efficient multicriteria decision-making method, was applied to select the best solution, i.e., the optimum terms of RPCs, through the ranking of solutions in the optimum set. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by using three VHSR images acquired by GeoEye-1, Worldview-3, and Pleiades satellite sensors. Experimental results show that subpixel accuracy can be nearly achieved in all data sets, when over-fitting problem is addressed. The optimal selected terms leaded to a significant improvement compared to the original RPCs. Indeed, our method, which is independent of GCPs distribution, not only requires a small number of GCPs, but also leads to a 30% to 75% improvement when compared to the original RPCs. This improvement in VHSR images, usually makes no more need to remove the RPCs biases.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2017.2712810","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/7987088/07970114.pdf","startPage":"1368","endPage":"1372","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2017.2712810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7987088","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective Genetic Optimization of Terrain-Independent RFMs for VHSR Satellite Images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7970114/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Genetic Optimization of Terrain-Independent RFMs for VHSR Satellite Images","volume":"14","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17032439","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7970114/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective Genetic Optimization of Terrain-Independent RFMs for VHSR Satellite Images","sourcePdf":"lgrs-alizadehnaeini-2712810-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075483S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"7987088","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7987088","articleId":"7970114","onlineDate":"06 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-08"},{"_id":7970116,"authors":[{"name":"Antreas Theodosiou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Cyprus University of Technology, Limassol, Cyprus"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Antreas","lastName":"Theodosiou","id":"37085550637"},{"name":"Michael Komodromos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Frederick University, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Komodromos","id":"38229780900"},{"name":"Kyriacos Kalli","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Cyprus University of Technology, Limassol, Cyprus"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Kyriacos","lastName":"Kalli","id":"37283944000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0733-8724"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2213"}],"articleNumber":"7970116","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":416},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Optical Society of America","url":"http://www.osa.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society","url":"http://taes.msubmit.net/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/im/imnew/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://mtt.org/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fibers","Fiber gratings","Reflection","Correlation","Transforms","Polymers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bragg gratings","demodulation","fibre optic sensors","Hilbert transforms","optical correlation","refractive index","strain measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimode gradient index CYTOP fiber","axial strain measurements","multimode fibers","cross-correlation algorithm","centroid detection algorithm","fiber Bragg gratings","wavelength shift tracking","Hilbert transform-based demodulation algorithm","multipeak FBG reflection spectra"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CYTOP polymer fibers","demodulation algorithm","fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors","fiber sensors","Hilbert transform","multimode fiber"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7970116","abstract":"We demonstrate a combined cross correlation and Hilbert transform-based demodulation algorithm for tracking the wavelength shifts of fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) having a multiple peak reflection spectrum.

It consists of two 4\u00d74 subarrays operating at 3G (1710-2170 MHz) and long term evolution (2490-2690 MHz) bands. For size miniaturization, the elements of the two 4 \u00d7 4 subarrays are interleaved with each other. The mutual coupling between the elements operating at different bands is suppressed by using filtering antennas with out-of-band radiation suppression. And the spacing between them can be decreased, resulting in array miniaturization. To obtain stable two-beam radiation patterns within the two operating bands, the beam-forming networks with little magnitude and phase imbalances are specially designed for each band. For demonstration, the proposed 4 \u00d7 8 array is implemented. In the measurement, the array exhibits stable 10-dB beamwidth around 120\u00b0 in the azimuth plane within the two entire bands. As a result, the two-beam radiation patterns satisfy the coverage requirement of 120\u00b0 in the azimuth plane for base-station applications. Additionally, 16.4 dBi/15.5 dBi peak gains and around -10 dB cross levels at the junction of two beams are achieved within the two operating bands. Compared with typical industrial products, the proposed array features both compact size and stable radiation patterns. Moreover, the proposed method can easily be extended to multibeam basestation array designs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact Dual-Band Dual-Polarized Interleaved Two-Beam Array With Stable Radiation Pattern Based on Filtering Elements","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2017.2723914","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/8024125/07970121.pdf","startPage":"4566","endPage":"4575","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2017.2723914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8024125","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7970121","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7970121/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Compact Dual-Band Dual-Polarized Interleaved Two-Beam Array With Stable Radiation Pattern Based on Filtering Elements","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7970121/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17155502","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61422106"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007162","fundingName":"Guangdong and Guangzhou Science and Technology Project","grantNumber":"2016A050503018, 201604016018 and 201704030064"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact Dual-Band Dual-Polarized Interleaved Two-Beam Array With Stable Radiation Pattern Based on Filtering Elements","sourcePdf":"tap-zhang-2723914-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067363S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8024125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"8024125","articleId":"7970121","onlineDate":"06 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":7970126,"authors":[{"name":"Duy-Hieu Bui","affiliation":["CEA-LETI, MINATEC Campus, Grenoble Alpes University, Grenoble, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/8118264/7970126/bui-2716386-small.gif","p":["Duy-Hieu Bui (S\u201913) received the B.Sc. degree in electronics telecommunication technology from the Vietnam National University-University of Engineering and Technology (VNU-UET), Hanoi, Vietnam, in 2010, and the M.Sc. degree in network and telecommunications from the University of Paris-Sud, Orsay, France, in 2012.

The security can be enhanced by using standardized and proven-secure block ciphers as advanced encryption standard (AES) for data encryption and authentication. However, these security functions take a large amount of processing power and power/energy consumption. In this paper, we present our hardware optimization strategies for AES for high-speed ultralow-power ultralow-energy IoT applications with multiple levels of security. Our design supports multiple security levels through different key sizes, power and energy optimization for both datapath and key expansion. The estimated power results show that our implementation may achieve an energy per bit comparable with the lightweight standardized algorithm PRESENT of less than 1 pJ/b at 10 MHz at 0.6 V with throughput of 28 Mb/s in ST FDSOI 28-nm technology. In terms of security evaluation, our proposed datapath, 32-b key out of 128 b cannot be revealed by correlation power analysis attack using less than 20 000 traces.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2017.2716386","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2017.2716386","startPage":"3281","endPage":"3290","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/8118264/07970126.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8118264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AES Datapath Optimization Strategies for Low-Power Low-Energy Multisecurity-Level Internet-of-Things Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7970126/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"AES Datapath Optimization Strategies for Low-Power Low-Energy Multisecurity-Level Internet-of-Things Applications","volume":"25","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2017","accessionNumber":"17390434","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7970126/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development","grantNumber":"102.02-2015.20"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AES Datapath Optimization Strategies for Low-Power Low-Energy Multisecurity-Level Internet-of-Things Applications","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-bui-2716386-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085703S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8118264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8118264","articleId":"7970126","onlineDate":"06 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7970133,"authors":[{"name":"Laurent Dussopt","affiliation":["University Grenoble-Alpes, Grenoble, France","CEA, LETI, Minatec Campus, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Dussopt","orcid":"0000-0002-3415-541X","id":"37300001800"},{"name":"Amazir Moknache","affiliation":["ANSYS Corporation, Montigny Le Bretonneux, France","CEA, LETI, Minatec Campus, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Amazir","lastName":"Moknache","id":"37085789549"},{"name":"Jussi S\u00e4ily","affiliation":["VTT Technical Research Center of Finland, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Jussi","lastName":"S\u00e4ily","id":"37270543900"},{"name":"Antti Lamminen","affiliation":["VTT Technical Research Center of Finland, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Antti","lastName":"Lamminen","id":"37545521800"},{"name":"Mikko Kaunisto","affiliation":["VTT Technical Research Center of Finland, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Mikko","lastName":"Kaunisto","id":"37085793940"},{"name":"Jouko Aurinsalo","affiliation":["VTT Technical Research Center of Finland, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Jouko","lastName":"Aurinsalo","id":"37658375900"},{"name":"Terry Bateman","affiliation":["Optiprint AG, Berneck, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Terry","lastName":"Bateman","id":"37085511373"},{"name":"Jim Francey","affiliation":["Optiprint AG, Berneck, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Jim","lastName":"Francey","id":"37563427000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"7970133","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1041},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Antenna arrays","Bandwidth","Switches","Apertures","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","electromagnetic wave polarisation","millimetre wave antenna arrays","mobile radio","printed circuits","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["V-band switched-beam linearly polarized transmit-array antenna","radiation properties","focal array","printed-circuit board materials","point-to-point communication systems","wireless backhaul applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beam switching","directive antenna","discrete lens","millimeter-wave antenna","transmit array"]}],"abstract":"A V-band, switched-beam, linearly polarized transmit-array antenna enabling self-pointing point-to-point communication systems, e.g., wireless backhaul applications in the future mobile networks, is presented.

It synthesizes identical far-field radiation patterns as a conventional single-feed square loop antenna. The dual-feed antenna (DFA) also simplifies or even eliminates the lossy power-combining network between the transmitter and antenna, achieving direct on-antenna power combining. The proposed antenna concept significantly improves the total radiated power and power efficiency of a wireless transmitter, particularly useful for 5G transmitters that normally require large output power to compensate the high mm-Wave path loss. Compared with antenna-array-based spatial power combining, the DFA only requires a single-antenna footprint and maintains the single-element beamwidth, ideal for mobile 5G communications. The dual-feed square loop antenna is designed and characterized at two potential 5G bands, i.e., 38.5 and 73.5 GHz. Conventional single-feed square loop antennas are implemented as reference designs. Closely matched antenna characteristics are achieved in measurement between the proposed DFA and conventional single-feed antenna. The dual-feed square loop antenna has measured broadside gain of 2.9 and 3 dBi, and fractional bandwidth of 13% and 14%, at 38.5 and 73.5 GHz, respectively. High-speed modulation test is also performed. A 4.3% error vector magnitude (EVM) with a -33.2-dBc adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) for 6-Gb/s 64QAM is achieved at 38.5 GHz, and a 5.6% EVM with a -33.4-dBc ACLR for 6-Gb/s 64QAM is measured at 73.5 GHz, which demonstrates the viability of the proposed DFA for high-speed and complex modulations required by 5G communications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Millimeter-Wave Dual-Feed Square Loop Antenna for 5G Communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2017.2723920","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/8124133/07970140.pdf","startPage":"6317","endPage":"6328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2017.2723920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8124133","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7970140","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7970140/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"A Millimeter-Wave Dual-Feed Square Loop Antenna for 5G Communications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7970140/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17394456","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100002418","fundingName":"Intel Corporation through Intel gift funding"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Millimeter-Wave Dual-Feed Square Loop Antenna for 5G Communications","sourcePdf":"tap-li-2723920-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065535S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8124133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8124133","articleId":"7970140","onlineDate":"06 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7970142,"authors":[{"name":"Yujuan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8392548/7970142/wang-2714187-small.gif","p":["Yujuan Wang received the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in 2016.","She is currently a Post-Doctoral Research Associate with the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.

By integrating the special topology feature of the new constructed symmetrical matrix, the technical difficulty in finite-time formation-containment control arising from the asymmetrical Laplacian matrix under single-way directed communication is circumvented. Based upon fractional power feedback of the local error, an adaptive distributed control scheme is established to drive the leaders into the prespecified formation configuration in finite time. Meanwhile, a distributed adaptive control scheme, independent of the unavailable inputs of the leaders, is designed to keep the followers within a bounded distance from the moving leaders and then to make the followers enter the convex hull shaped by the formation of the leaders in finite time. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is confirmed by the simulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/8392548/07970142.pdf","startPage":"3164","endPage":"3175","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2714187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2714187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8392548","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7970142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Adaptive Finite-Time Approach for Formation\u2013Containment Control of Networked Nonlinear Systems Under Directed Topology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Network topology","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Laplace equations","Symmetric matrices","Adaptive systems","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","distributed control","matrix algebra","networked control systems","nonlinear control systems","nonlinear dynamical systems","topology","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["networked nonlinear systems","directed topology","distributed adaptive finite-time control solution","formation-containment problem","multiple networked systems","uncertain nonlinear dynamics","directed communication constraints","finite-time formation-containment control","asymmetrical Laplacian matrix","single-way directed communication","symmetrical matrix","convex hull"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Directed interaction topology","finite-time control","formation\u2013containment","nonlinear multiagent systems (MAS)"]}],"chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/5962385/8392548/7970142-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7970142/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Adaptive Finite-Time Approach for Formation\u2013Containment Control of Networked Nonlinear Systems Under Directed Topology","volume":"29","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7970142/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"17861351","pubMedId":"28692994","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Technology Transformation Program of Chongqing Higher Education University","grantNumber":"KJZH17102"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1307678"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61528301"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Distributed Adaptive Finite-Time Approach for Formation\u2013Containment Control of Networked Nonlinear Systems Under Directed Topology","sourcePdf":"tnnls-song-2714187-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085938S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8392548","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8392548","articleId":"7970142","onlineDate":"06 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7970146,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Liu","affiliation":["College of Science, Hohai University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8392548/7970146/liu-2713824-small.gif","p":["Lei Liu received the B.S. degree in applied mathematics from Anhui University, Hefei, China, in 2005, and the M.S. degree in applied mathematics and the Ph.D. degree from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2008 and 2012, respectively.","He joined the College of Science, Hohai University, Nanjing, China, and became an Associate Professor in 2014.

A system designing procedure for QVNNs is developed by employing quaternion matrix decomposition, and a given set of states can be assigned as the equilibrium points of the designed QVNNs. Moreover, some sufficient conditions for the asymptotic stability of the equilibrium points are obtained via Lyapunov's direct method. Numerical simulations manifest that the constructed QVNNs work efficiently on storing and retrieving blurred gray-scale and true color images.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7970154/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 July 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18235476","volume":"48","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7970154/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design and Analysis of Quaternion-Valued Neural Networks for Associative Memories","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Program of Chongqing Innovation Team Project in University","grantNumber":"CXTDX201601022"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007957","fundingName":"Chongqing Municipal Education Commission","grantNumber":"KJ1705138 and KJ1600504"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005230","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing","grantNumber":"cstc2017jcyjA1353"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Analysis of Quaternion-Valued Neural Networks for Associative Memories","sourcePdf":"tsmc-song-2717866-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130686S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"8536932","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8536932","articleId":"7970154","onlineDate":"06 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7970161,"authors":[{"name":"An Zhao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Technology in Geo-Spatial Information Processing and Application System, Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"An","lastName":"Zhao","orcid":"0000-0001-7926-2158","id":"37086045139"},{"name":"Kun Fu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Technology in Geo-Spatial Information Processing and Application System, Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Fu","id":"37301939300"},{"name":"Siyue Wang","affiliation":["Boston University, Boston, MA, USA","Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Siyue","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086040196"},{"name":"Jiawei Zuo","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Technology in Geo-Spatial Information Processing and Application System, Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiawei","lastName":"Zuo","id":"37086046265"},{"name":"Yuhang Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Technology in Geo-Spatial Information Processing and Application System, Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuhang","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0001-5382-6496","id":"37086040894"},{"name":"Yanfeng Hu","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yanfeng","lastName":"Hu","id":"38188871800"},{"name":"Hongqi Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Technology in Geo-Spatial Information Processing and Application System, Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongqi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37578484600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"7970161","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":780},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aircraft","Training","Military aircraft","Training data","Feature extraction","Remote sensing","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft","image fusion","image matching","neural nets","object detection","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["remote sensing images","aircraft type recognition","civil applications","military applications","aircraft landmark detection","convolutional neural network","vanilla network","landmarks regression","rotation jittering","data augmentation","multicrop fusion","landmark template matching"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aircraft recognition","convolutional neural network (CNN)","landmark detection"]}],"abstract":"Aircraft type recognition of remote sensing images is critical both in civil and military applications. In this letter, we propose a novel landmark-based aircraft recognition method which is highly accurate and efficient. First, we propose a new idea to address the aircraft type recognition problem by aircraft's landmark detection. Its advantages are two folds. On the one hand, it needs fewer labeled data and alleviates the work of human annotation. On the other hand, a trained model has strong expansibility because it can be used for any type of aircraft that not contained in training data set without retraining. Then, we use a variant of a convolutional neural network called vanilla network for all landmarks regression at the same time. Therefore, it can avoid bad local minimum effectively by encoding the geometric constraints among landmarks implicitly. To handle aircrafts in myriads of poses, rotation jittering is used for data augmentation in preprocessing and multicrop fusion is used in postprocessing. Thus, an 80% reduction in error rate could be reached. Finally, we use the landmark template matching to recognize the aircraft. Our method shows a competitive performance both in accuracy and efficiency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aircraft Recognition Based on Landmark Detection in Remote Sensing Images","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2017.2715858","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/7987088/07970161.pdf","startPage":"1413","endPage":"1417","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2017.2715858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7987088","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7970161","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7970161/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Aircraft Recognition Based on Landmark Detection in Remote Sensing Images","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7970161/","dateOfInsertion":"20 July 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17032450","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41501485"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aircraft Recognition Based on Landmark Detection in Remote Sensing Images","sourcePdf":"lgrs-zhao-2715858-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072113S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"7987088","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7987088","articleId":"7970161","onlineDate":"06 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7970164,"authors":[{"name":"Keke Gai","affiliation":["Pace University, New York, NY, US"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7274860/8375050/7970164/gai-2723954-small.gif","p":["Keke Gai received the BEng degree from the Nanjing University of\n Science and Technology, the MBA degree from the University of British Columbia (MET), and the MS degree from Lawrence\n Technological University.

Combining CPS with heterogeneous cloud computing is an alternative approach for increasing sustainability of the system. However, execution of resource management in cloud systems is still encountering a few challenges, including the bottlenecks of the Web server capacities and task assignments in the heterogeneous cloud. The unstable service demands often result in service delays, which embarrasses the competitiveness of the enterprises. This paper addresses the problem of the task assignment in heterogeneous clouds, which is proved as a NP-hard problem. The proposed approach is called Smart Cloud-based Optimizing Workload (SCOW) Modelthat uses predictive cloud capacities and considers sustainable factors to assign tasks to heterogeneous clouds. To reach the optimization objective, we propose a few algorithms, which include Workload Resource Minimization Algorithm (WRM), Smart Task Assignment (STA) Algorithm, and Task Mapping Algorithm (TMA).

Conventionally, the primary channel gain is estimated in the primary system, and thus unavailable at the CT. To deal with the issue, two estimators are proposed by enabling the CT to sense primary signals. In particular, by adopting the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion to analyze the received primary signal, an ML estimator is first developed. To reduce the computational complexity of the ML estimator, a median-based (MB) estimator is then proposed. By comparing the ML estimator and the MB estimator from the aspects of the computational complexity as well as the estimation accuracy, both advantages and disadvantages of two estimators are revealed. Simulation results show that the estimation errors of both estimators can be as small as 0.015. Meanwhile, the ML estimator outperforms the MB estimator in terms of the estimation accuracy if the sensed primary signal at the CT is weak. Otherwise, the MB estimator is superior to the ML estimator from the aspects of both the computational complexity and the estimation accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2723885","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2723885","startPage":"4152","endPage":"4162","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8068314/07970169.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8068314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Primary Channel Gain Estimation for Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7970169/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Primary Channel Gain Estimation for Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio Networks","volume":"65","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17256478","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7970169/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601094, 61571100, 61631005 and 61628103"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"ZYGX2016J016"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Primary Channel Gain Estimation for Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-zhao-2723885-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1722S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8068314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8068314","articleId":"7970169","onlineDate":"06 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7970172,"authors":[{"name":"Jinting Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687307/8061077/7970172/wang-2723900-small.gif","p":["Jinting Wang received the B.Sc. degree from Hebei Normal University, Shijiazhuang, China, in 1994, the M.Sc. degree from the Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China, in 1997, and the Ph.D. degree from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2000.","He is a Professor and the Deputy Director with the Department of Mathematics, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China.

To characterize the random access protocols of wireless networks, a retrial queueing system is employed to model the decentralized and centralized behavior of SUs. Based on the tradeoff between the service reward and the delay cost, each SU must decide whether to join or balk the system upon arrival based on different levels of information provided by the system. Two situations in which SUs have no information or partially observable information are studied. In each situation, two kinds of strategies are considered: 1) individual equilibrium strategies (i.e., non-cooperative strategies) that maximize SUs' own profit and 2) socially optimal strategies (i.e., cooperative strategies) that maximize the expected social welfare. Moreover, comparisons are carried out between these two kinds of strategies. The results indicate that the equilibrium joining probability in the non-cooperative case is not less than the optimal joining probability in the cooperative case. To regulate the SUs' behavior, an equilibrium pricing scheme is proposed to make these strategies coincide. In addition, we observe that the expected delay and the mean number of SUs in the system only depend on the first two moments of the SU's transmission time. Numerical examples also show that the partially observable queue is more profitable from the perspective of the social planner.","doi":"10.1109/TCCN.2017.2723900","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687307/8061077/07970172.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8061077","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCCN.2017.2723900","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","startPage":"298","endPage":"312","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Strategic Joining and Optimal Pricing in the Cognitive Radio System With Delay-Sensitive Secondary Users","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7970172","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6687307/8061077/7970172-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Strategic Joining and Optimal Pricing in the Cognitive Radio System With Delay-Sensitive Secondary Users","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7970172/","volume":"3","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7970172/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17281957","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"71571014 and 71390334"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008982","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1137732"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Strategic Joining and Optimal Pricing in the Cognitive Radio System With Delay-Sensitive Secondary Users","sourcePdf":"tccn-wang-2723900-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094737S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6687307","isNumber":"8061077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687307","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8061077","articleId":"7970172","onlineDate":"06 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7970174,"authors":[{"name":"Shashanka Ubaru","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, MN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Shashanka Ubaru is a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.

Recently, randomized sketching algorithms were proposed to effectively construct low rank approximations and obtain approximate singular value decompositions of large matrices. Similar ideas were used to solve least squares regression problems. In this paper, we show how matrices from error correcting codes can be used to find such low rank approximations and matrix decompositions, and extend the framework to linear least squares regression problems. The benefits of using these code matrices are the following. First, they are easy to generate and they reduce randomness significantly. Second, code matrices, with mild restrictions, satisfy the subspace embedding property, and have a better chance of preserving the geometry of an large subspace of vectors. Third, for parallel and distributed applications, code matrices have significant advantages over structured random matrices and Gaussian random matrices. Fourth, unlike Fourier or Hadamard transform matrices, which require sampling O(k log k) columns for a rank-k approximation, the log factor is not necessary for certain types of code matrices. In particular, (1 + \u03f5) optimal Frobenius norm error can be achieved for a rank-k approximation with O(k/\u03f5) samples. Fifth, fast multiplication is possible with structured code matrices, so fast approximations can be achieved for general dense input matrices.

Based on a cascaded three degrees-of-freedom model of surface vessel, the backstepping technique is adopted as the main control framework. Error constraint of the vessel position is handled by integrating a novel tan-type barrier Lyapunov function. The proposed ECLOS method is in accordance with the classical line-of-sight method where no constraint is imposed. A nonlinear disturbance observer is developed to estimate the lumped disturbance that comprises the effects of parametric uncertainties, external environment disturbances, and actuator saturation and faults. It is proved that under the proposed control, the constrained requirements on the vessel position error are never violated and all closed-loop signals are uniformly ultimately bounded, regardless of fully actuated or under-actuated control configuration.

As mid-level semantic properties shared cross different object classes, attributes have been studied extensively for knowledge transfer across classes. Most previous attribute learning methods focus only on human-defined/nameable semantic attributes, whilst ignoring the fact there also exist undefined/latent shareable visual properties, or latent attributes. These latent attributes can be either discriminative or non-discriminative parts depending on whether they can contribute to an object recognition task. In this work, we argue that learning the latent attributes jointly with user-defined semantic attributes not only leads to better representation but also helps semantic attribute prediction. A novel dictionary learning model is proposed which decomposes the dictionary space into three parts corresponding to semantic, latent discriminative and latent background attributes respectively. Such a joint attribute learning model is then extended by following a multi-task transfer learning framework to address a more challenging unsupervised domain adaptation problem, where annotations are only available on an auxiliary dataset and the target dataset is completely unlabelled. Extensive experiments show that the proposed models, though being linear and thus extremely efficient to compute, produce state-of-the-art results on both zero-shot learning and person re-identification.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Semantic and Latent Attribute Modelling for Cross-Class Transfer Learning","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2017.2723882","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/8371350/07970176.pdf","startPage":"1625","endPage":"1638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2017.2723882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8371350","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7970176","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7970176/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1 2018","displayDocTitle":"Joint Semantic and Latent Attribute Modelling for Cross-Class Transfer Learning","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7970176/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2018","publicationDate":"1 July 2018","accessionNumber":"17805223","pubMedId":"28692964","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61390515, U1611461, 61425025 and 61471042"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2015CB351806"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Semantic and Latent Attribute Modelling for Cross-Class Transfer Learning","sourcePdf":"tpami-tian-2723882-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.219364S","chronDate":"July 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"8371350","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8371350","articleId":"7970176","onlineDate":"06 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7970177,"authors":[{"name":"Kosei Shinoda","affiliation":["SuperGrid Institute SAS, Villeurbanne, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/8266610/7970177/shino-2723939-small.gif","p":["Kosei Shinoda received the M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering\n from Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan, and in electrical engineering for smart grids and buildings from the Institut\n National Polytechnique de Grenoble, Grenoble, France, in 2013 and 2014, respectively.

Besides the recognized advantages over conventional voltage source converters, one of the remarkable features of the MMC is its ability to store energy in the distributed submodule capacitors. This important feature can be used to mitigate the fluctuations of the DC voltage, which is inherently volatile against power disturbances compared to the frequency of conventional AC systems. This paper proposes a novel control strategy, called virtual capacitor control, which enables the utilization of the energy storage capability of the MMC to attenuate voltage fluctuations of HVDC systems. With the proposed control, the MMC behaves as if there were a physical capacitor whose size is adjustable and can be even bigger than the physical capacitor embedded in the converter. This control allows the system operator to optionally adjust this virtual capacitor of each MMC station and, thus, it provides an additional degree of freedom to the HVDC system operation. The EMT simulations of a 401-level MMC-based HVDC link system show the effectiveness of the proposed control to improve dc voltage transient dynamics.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel7/61/8266610/07970177.pdf","startPage":"455","endPage":"465","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2017.2723939","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2017.2723939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8266610","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7970177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual Capacitor Control: Mitigation of DC Voltage Fluctuations in MMC-Based HVdc Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","HVDC transmission","Voltage control","Power system dynamics","Topology","Power conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HVDC power convertors","HVDC power transmission","power capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC voltage fluctuations","HVdc systems","modular multilevel converters","distributed submodule capacitors","power disturbances","HVDC systems","physical capacitor","MMC station","HVDC link system","voltage source converters","virtual capacitor control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AC-DC power converters","converter control","electromagnetic transients program (EMTP)","high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission","modular multilevel converters (MMCs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7970177/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Virtual Capacitor Control: Mitigation of DC Voltage Fluctuations in MMC-Based HVdc Systems","volume":"33","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7970177/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17519785","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"French Government","grantNumber":"ANE-ITE-002-01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual Capacitor Control: Mitigation of DC Voltage Fluctuations in MMC-Based HVdc Systems","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-shinoda-2723939-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051218S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"8266610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8266610","articleId":"7970177","onlineDate":"06 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7970179,"authors":[{"name":"Shreya Gupta","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7983475/7970179/gupta-2717929-small.gif","p":["Shreya Gupta received the B.Tech. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Delhi Technological University, New Delhi, India, in 2015.

The ferroelectric (FE) material in the gate stack of the FEFET exhibits negative capacitance resulting in voltage step-up action which entails sub-60 mV/decade subthreshold swing at room temperature. The thickness of the FE layer (T\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FE</sub>\n) is an important design parameter, governing the device-circuit operation. This paper extensively analyzes the impact of T\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FE</sub>\n on the device-circuit characteristics in conjunction with the interactions between FE and gate/drain capacitances. While it is well known that increasing TFE yields higher gain albeit with the possibilities of introducing hysteresis, our analysis points to other unconventional effects emerging in circuits as T\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FE</sub>\n is increased.

While the former effect results in the loss in gain of a logic gate, the latter may yield hysteretic voltage transfer characteristics.

To find the miss rate of a particular cache, the reuse distance profile has to be measured for that particular level and configuration of the cache. Significant amount of simulation time and overhead can be reduced if we can find the miss rate of higher level cache like L2 cache from the RD profile with respect to a lower level cache (i.e., cache that is closer to the processor) such as L1. The objective of this paper is to give an analytical method to find the miss rate of L2 cache for various configurations from the RD profile with respect to L1 cache. We consider all three types of cache inclusion policies namely (i) Strictly Inclusive, (ii) Mutually Exclusive and (iii) Non-Inclusive Non-Exclusive policy. We first prove some general results relating the RD profile of L1 cache to that of L2 cache. We use probabilistic analysis for our derivations. We validate our model against simulations, using the multi-core simulator Sniper with the PARSEC and the SPLASH benchmark suites.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8176066","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/8176066/07970187.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TC.2017.2723878","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2017.2723878","startPage":"9","endPage":"15","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical Miss Rate Calculation of L2 Cache from the RD Profile of L1 Cache","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 July 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 1 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7970187/","displayDocTitle":"Analytical Miss Rate Calculation of L2 Cache from the RD Profile of L1 Cache","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7970187/","volume":"67","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"17525622","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","publicationDate":"1 Jan. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical Miss Rate Calculation of L2 Cache from the RD Profile of L1 Cache","sourcePdf":"tc-tg-2723878-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08619S","chronDate":"Jan. 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"8176066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8176066","articleId":"7970187","onlineDate":"06 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7970295,"authors":[{"name":"Youjiang Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Engineering, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Youjiang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086008921"},{"name":"Dahai Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Engineering, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Dahai","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086072116"},{"name":"Guifu Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Engineering, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Guifu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086073949"},{"name":"Niantong Du","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Engineering, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Niantong","lastName":"Du","id":"37086068503"},{"name":"Yongtao Qiu","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Engineering, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Yongtao","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37086068952"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4005-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4003-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4006-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7970295","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":520},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7970295","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Wideband","Timing","Frequency measurement","Clocks","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","frequency-domain analysis","iterative methods","sample and hold circuits","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-interleaved ADC system","wideband RF front-end","embedded fully-blind digital calibration","wideband track-hold front-end","time-interleaving 16-channel sub-ADC","digital blind post-calibration","frequency domain analysis","timing mismatch errors","gain mismatch errors","offset mismatch errors","blind calibration","iterative loop","wideband signal sampling","frequency 16 GHz","word length 4.5 bit","word length 6.5 bit","word length 8 bit"]}],"abstract":"This paper implements a time-interleaved ADC (TI-ADC) system with embedded 16GHz wideband track-hold (T/H) front-end.

A digital blind post-calibration technique based on frequency domain analysis of the TI-ADC output is proposed, which is characterized using a comprehensive TI-ADC behavioral model. The model takes into account the timing, gain and offset mismatch errors. All the three mismatch errors are characterized using the specific basis functions. Without the need of training sequence, a blind calibration model is developed during an iterative loop to extract the mismatch errors, which are subtracted from the measured TI-ADC output successively. A maximum of 3-bit improvement for the effective number of bit (ENOB) has been achieved, resulting in a 6.5 bit ENOB at low-end frequency and 4.5 bit ENOB at high-end frequency. Further, the proposed technique is also effective to wideband signal's sampling.","doi":"10.1109/GSMM.2017.7970295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7970274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GSMM.2017.7970295","publicationTitle":"2017 10th Global Symposium on Millimeter-Waves","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 10th Global Symposium on Millimeter-Waves","pdfPath":"/iel7/7958785/7970274/07970295.pdf","startPage":"140","endPage":"142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 32GS/s 8-bit time-interleaved ADC system with 16GHz wideband RF front-end and embedded fully-blind digital calibration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"A 32GS/s 8-bit time-interleaved ADC system with 16GHz wideband RF front-end and embedded fully-blind digital calibration","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7970295/","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17013456","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7970295/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 32GS/s 8-bit time-interleaved ADC system with 16GHz wideband RF front-end and embedded fully-blind digital calibration","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"MB1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063849S","chronDate":"24-26 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7958785","isNumber":"7970274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7958785","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7970274","articleId":"7970295","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7970307,"authors":[{"name":"Guansheng Lv","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Guansheng Lv","id":"37087064608"},{"name":"Wenhua Chen","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wenhua Chen","id":"37087065608"},{"name":"Zhenghe Feng","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhenghe Feng","id":"37087065963"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4005-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4003-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4006-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7970307","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":354},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Couplers","Power generation","Power dividers","Wideband","Couplings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency response","gallium arsenide","III-V semiconductors","millimetre wave power amplifiers","power dividers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimeter-wave sequential power amplifier","power divider","GaAs power amplifier chips","output coupler","frequency response","frequency 26 GHz","GaAs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sequential power amplifier","millimeter-wave","GaAs","5G"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7970307","doi":"10.1109/GSMM.2017.7970307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GSMM.2017.7970307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7970274","publicationTitle":"2017 10th Global Symposium on Millimeter-Waves","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 10th Global Symposium on Millimeter-Waves","pdfPath":"/iel7/7958785/7970274/07970307.pdf","startPage":"123","endPage":"125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A millimeter-wave sequential power amplifier","abstract":"In this paper, we present a millimeter-wave sequential power amplifier (SPA) at the frequency of 26GHz for the first time.

The motivation is to propose a low-profile broadband high-gain receiving antenna with beam-scanning and circular polarization features. The antenna is based on a lateral sparse substrate integrated waveguide, which is constructed by a microstrip line shorted with two rows of sparse and abundant periodic metallic via-holes on both sides with periodic transverse slots etched on the upper side. To achieve good circularly polarized radiation and compact configuration, non-uniform SIW width configuration is used to realize effective phase shift over the relative broadband. Measured results show that the antenna presents experimentally expected broadband matched impedance with return loss |S\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">11</sub>\n| > 10 dB from 15.4 GHz to 19 GHz. The measured radiation pattern exhibits continuous frequency-scanning from 35\u00b0 at 15.5 GHz to 47\u00b0 at 18 GHz according to the broadside with maximum gain of 12.3 dBic. The measured axial ratio is within 3 dB from 15.9 GHz to 17.2 GHz. Measured results are in good agreement with predicted ones, and it is demonstrated that the proposed structure is a simple and compact candidate of high performance circularly-polarized antenna for satellite communications. Also the beam scanning capability of proposed antenna could find potential applications in inter-satellite communications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 10th Global Symposium on Millimeter-Waves","pdfPath":"/iel7/7958785/7970274/07970339.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"190","publicationTitle":"2017 10th Global Symposium on Millimeter-Waves","doi":"10.1109/GSMM.2017.7970339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GSMM.2017.7970339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7970274","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7970339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"K<inf>u</inf>-band circularly polarized leaky-wave antenna based on lateral sparse substrate integrated waveguide for satellite communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Broadband antennas","Gain","Frequency measurement","Antenna radiation patterns","Broadband communication","Microstrip antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband antennas","leaky wave antennas","microstrip antennas","microstrip lines","polarisation","receiving antennas","satellite antennas","scanning antennas","substrate integrated waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lateral sparse substrate integrated waveguide","Ku-band circularly polarized leaky-wave antenna","user terminal LWA","satellite communication system","low-profile broadband high-gain receiving antenna","beam-scanning features","circular polarization features","microstrip line","nonuniform SIW width configuration","circularly polarized radiation compact configuration","phase shift","continuous frequency-scanning","antenna beam scanning capability","intersatellite communication","frequency 15.9 GHz to 17.2 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7970339/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"K<inf>u</inf>-band circularly polarized leaky-wave antenna based on lateral sparse substrate integrated waveguide for satellite communication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7970339/","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17013447","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2017","conferenceDate":"24-26 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"K<inf>u</inf>-band circularly polarized leaky-wave antenna based on lateral sparse substrate integrated waveguide for satellite communication","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"YC4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057502S","chronDate":"24-26 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7958785","isNumber":"7970274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7958785","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7970274","articleId":"7970339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7970403,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Using the Successive Loop Closure technique, two high-level control techniques were designed to track the aircraft vertical position: A nonlinear one, based on Lyapunov functions to develop Integral Backstepping; And another linear, based on the PID method. Finally, the results were simulated and analyzed through non-intrusive performance indexes, based on the integral errors (IAE, ISE and ITSE). The results indicated that the nonlinear controller designed was superior compared to the linear one.

The aim is to adjust such regulators online in accordance with plant parameters change to improve the quality of transients and, as a result, plant energy efficiency. A neural tuner is used for these purposes. It includes a neural network (its outputs are the values of the controller parameters) and the rules database. Their conditions contain a description of situations when tuning (network training) is required. The consequences are formulas to calculate the network learning rate. The problem is that there is no criterion to understand if the rate is too high. That may cause the control system instability. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method to calculate the maximal learning rate for the neural network of the PI-controller tuner in a situation when a setpoint value is changed stepwise. This method is based on the second Lyapunov's method and system sustainability evaluation. At the same time, it does not require either a plant or a reference model. The Lyapunov's function and its derivative are calculated at each particular moment of time. The developed formulas make it possible to estimate the admissible learning rate to keep the Lyapunov's function derivative negative. The proposed method is applied to control a muffle furnace. The obtained results confirm the reliability of the proposed method. The energy efficiency of the furnace using the tuner is improved by 6-7%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 May 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7970600/","accessionNumber":"17014436","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7970600/","publicationDate":"May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2017","conferenceDate":"24-26 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On maximal learning rate value calculation for neural network of PI-controller neural tuner solving heating plants control problem","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On maximal learning rate value calculation for neural network of PI-controller neural tuner solving heating plants control problem","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075997S","chronDate":"24-26 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7961125","isNumber":"7970474","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7961125","xplore-issue":"7970474","articleId":"7970600","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7970602,"authors":[{"name":"Valentina V.

The main goal of the study is to find the parameters of a genetic algorithm with a minimum search time of a radar signal with given ACF parameters. In this paper, it is shown that using as an optimization function minimizing of the RMS level of the side lobe results in better indicators than when minimizing the maximum side lobe.

It is supposed that robots are equipped with many sensors such that a set of environment vectors can be obtained at every time moment. A Siamese neural network (SNN) as a special type of neural networks is proposed to be used in order to detect anomalous behavior. It can be regarded as an alternative to the well-known Mahalanobis distance (MD) often used in anomaly detection. Strategies for efficient training the SNN are considered. In order to simplify the SNN training, we also propose to use a hierarchical neural network. By means of the SNN and the proposed network architectures, the anomalous behavior detection of robots by complex data structures received from the set of sensors can be significantly simplified.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An anomalous behavior detection of a robot system by using a hierarchical Siamese neural network","publicationTitle":"2017 XX IEEE International Conference on Soft Computing and Measurements (SCM)","doi":"10.1109/SCM.2017.7970671","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 XX IEEE International Conference on Soft Computing and Measurements (SCM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7961125/7970474/07970671.pdf","startPage":"630","endPage":"634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCM.2017.7970671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7970474","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7970671","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7970671/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"An anomalous behavior detection of a robot system by using a hierarchical Siamese neural network","conferenceDate":"24-26 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7970671/","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2017","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17014458","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An anomalous behavior detection of a robot system by using a hierarchical Siamese neural network","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074947S","chronDate":"24-26 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7961125","isNumber":"7970474","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7961125","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7970474","articleId":"7970671","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7970698,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Then, we present non-orthogonal multi-rate MBMS transmission (NOMRMT) and non-orthogonal multi-service MBMS transmission schemes and investigate their performance by using stochastic geometry. A tractable mode is developed to analyze the performance of asynchronous and synchronous non-orthogonal MBMS transmission. Based on this model, analytical expressions for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio coverage probability, average number of served users, and sum rate are derived.

One of the cutting-edge heuristics for this problem is a simulated annealing (SA)-based algorithm named the SA-FVSP. In this paper, we propose an improved variant of the SA-FVSP by applying the nonuniform neighborhood sampling (NNS), namely, the SA-FVSP-NNS. The NNS is a general strategy for improving the SA-based algorithm. Its basic idea is to prioritize the neighbors which are closer to the global optimum by assigning them with higher sampling probabilities. By doing this, these neighbors are more likely to be selected in the sampling process. To apply this general strategy to the SA-FVSP, we propose the concepts of the priority function and the sampling function, respectively. The priority function utilizes the known heuristic rules of the FVSP to estimate and score the quality of neighbors, while the sampling function converts the scores computed by the priority function to sampling probabilities, which can directly guide the NNS process. Experiments indicate that the SA-FVSP-NNS algorithm outperforms the SA-FVSP.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Simulated annealing","Algorithm design and analysis","Search

fiber-optic systems using direct-detection is the key for increasing the transmission rates and/or reach. Some of the solutions used in the past include additional components, e.g., a dispersion-compensating fiber or an IQ-modulator, which increase the costs of the entire system. Another solution, the compensation of the channel distortions using decision-feedback equalization, is limited to its error-propagation effect. In this paper, we introduce Tomlinson-Harashima precoding for the compensation of power-fading, which allows us to use the efficiency of feedback equalization for channels with spectral zeros without the disadvantage of error propagation. In an experimental investigation with different scenarios, including transmission over 25 km up to 100 km of standard single-mode fiber with gross data rates ranging from 56 to 560 Gb/s, we show that Tomlinson-Harashima precoding significantly outperforms decision-feedback equalization in all cases. Using Tomlinson-Harashima precoding, power-fading can be efficiently compensated for using digital signal processing only, keeping the system flexible and at the same time cost-effective.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2017.2724032","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave

antenna area constraint, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems require a low-pulse repetition frequency (PRF) to image the wide swaths in ocean surface monitoring scenarios. However, the low PRF that is lower than the Doppler bandwidth will cause azimuth ambiguities. This letter proposes a novel method of mitigating azimuth ambiguities when using an undersampled SAR system for ship detection over the open sea. In this letter, the concept of range subspectra is adopted to misregister the azimuth ambiguity signals. In addition, a change detection method that uses a principal component analysis and k-means clustering is adopted to detect differences in the azimuth ambiguities between two range subspectra images in which the azimuth ambiguities are misregistered. By compensating for the ambiguities in the corresponding image, the ambiguities can be mitigated. This method is only appropriate for bright targets over dark backgrounds in which residual energy loss occurs for useful signals. Both simulated and real data processing results have validated the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that it is feasible for maritime surveillance.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2017.2717459","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2017.2717459","startPage":"1423","endPage":"1427","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/7987088/07971910.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7987088","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maritime Surveillance With Undersampled SAR","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Maritime Surveillance With Undersampled SAR","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"20 July 2017","volume":"14","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7971910/","accessionNumber":"17032438","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7971910/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maritime Surveillance With Undersampled SAR","sourcePdf":"lgrs-li-2717459-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070581S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"7987088","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7987088","articleId":"7971910","onlineDate":"07 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7971913,"authors":[{"name":"Kashif Bilal","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar","COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7971913/bilal-2720189-small.gif","p":["Kashif Bilal received the Ph.D. degree from North Dakota State University, USA.

We propose a novel system to collect individual video streams (views) captured for the same event by multiple attendees, and combine them into multi-view videos, where viewers can watch the event from various angles, taking crowdsourced media streaming to a new immersive level. The proposed system is called Cloud-based Multi-View Crowd sourced Streaming (CMVCS), and it delivers multiple views of an event to viewers at the best possible video representation based on each viewer's available bandwidth. The CMVCS is a complex system having many research challenges. In this paper, we focus on resource allocation of the CMVCS system. The objective of the study is to maximize the overall viewer satisfaction by allocating available resources to transcode views in an optimal set of representations, subject to computational and bandwidth constraints. We choose the video representation set to maximize QoE using Mixed Integer Programming. Moreover, we propose a Fairness-Based Representation Selection (FBRS) heuristic algorithm to solve the resource allocation problem efficiently. We compare our results with optimal and Top-N strategies. The simulation results demonstrate that FBRS generates near optimal results and outperforms the state-of-the-art Top-N policy, which is used by a large-scale system (Twitch).","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2720189","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07971913.pdf","startPage":"12635","endPage":"12647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2720189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crowdsourced Multi-View Live Video Streaming using Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7971913/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","displayDocTitle":"Crowdsourced Multi-View Live Video Streaming using Cloud Computing","htmlLink":"/document/7971913/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2017","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17124509","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008982","fundingName":"NPRP through the Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation)","grantNumber":"8-519-1-108"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Crowdsourced Multi-View Live Video Streaming using Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"access-bilal-2720189-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08029S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7971913","onlineDate":"07 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7971914,"authors":[{"name":"Youwei Yuan","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Complex Systems Modeling and Simulation, Ministry of Education, Hangzhou, China","School of Computer Science and Technology, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7971914/yuan-2723758-small.gif","p":["Youwei Yuan was born in 1966.

However, problems caused by physical limitations, such as asymmetric I/O latencies and outof-place updates, still need to be resolved. By using a probability of reference (PR) to select a candidate page as the victim page, this paper presents a novel buffer replacement algorithm called PR least recently used to enhance the flash memory performance. To predict whether a page may be referenced in the future, three variables are used to calculate a page's PR. In addition, we improve the performance overhead of the number of write operations, the hit ratio, and the runtime using a novel PR strategy. The algorithm is implemented and tested on the flash simulation platform Flash-DBSim. The results indicate that our algorithm provides improvements of up to 7% for the hit ratio with an improvement of up to 36.7% for the overall runtime compared with other approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2723758","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2723758","startPage":"12626","endPage":"12634","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07971914.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PR-LRU: A Novel Buffer Replacement Algorithm Based on the Probability of Reference for Flash Memory","topic":"Emerging Trends, Issues, and Challenges in Energy-Efficient Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7971914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"PR-LRU: A Novel Buffer Replacement Algorithm Based on the Probability of Reference for Flash Memory","volume":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17124517","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","htmlLink":"/document/7971914/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province","grantNumber":"Y17E050119"},{"fundingName":"Research Center of Information Technology & Economic and Social Development in Zhejiang Province","grantNumber":"15XXHJD04"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"PR-LRU: A Novel Buffer Replacement Algorithm Based on the Probability of Reference for Flash Memory","sourcePdf":"access-yuan-2723758-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078685S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Emerging Trends, Issues, and Challenges in Energy-Efficient Cloud Computing"],"articleId":"7971914","onlineDate":"07 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7971921,"authors":[{"name":"Wala Saadeh","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan","Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/8048205/7971921/saade-2713522-small.gif","p":["Wala Saadeh (S\u201912\u2013M\u201916) received the B.S. degree from the Computer Engineering Department, Yarmouk University, Irbid, Jordan, in 2009, and the M.Sc. degree in microsystems engineering and Ph.D. degree in interdisciplinary program from the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, in 2012 and 2016, respectively.","In 2013, she joined Test-Chip Integration team, Global Foundries, Dresden, Germany, as a Test-Chip intern, where she performed quality assurance tests on advanced nodes for DFM.

The proposed pseudo orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (P-OFDM) TRX combines baseband BPSK-OFDM with frequency-shift keying (FSK) to alleviate the impacts of variable ground effect and variable skin-electrode contact impedance, which have been the two major issues on the BCC. It can tolerate up to 20 dB of channel gain variation with measured bit error rate improvement of >70% compared to FSK modulation alone. The RC relaxed contact impedance monitor continuously monitors and compensates the variable skin-electrode contact impedance at both transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX). The proposed power-gated 8-point inverse fast Fourier transform/fast Fourier transform with no floating-point multipliers (FPMs) reduces the gate count and power by 54% and 30% compared to conventional FPMs, respectively. Additionally, the simple floating-point adder (FPA) reduces the gate count and energy consumption by 34% and 20% compared to conventional FPAs, respectively. A high input impedance glitch-free FSK demodulation RX with variable threshold limiter and all digital cycle correction is also proposed to support a scalable data rate (200 Kbps-2 Mbps).

However, due to the increased request for storage density coupled with performance that positions the storage tier closer to the latency of the processing elements, NAND Flash are becoming a serious bottleneck. DRAM as well are a limitation in the SSD reliability due to their vulnerability to the power loss events. Several emerging memory technologies are candidate to replace them, namely the storage class memories. Phase change memories and magnetic memories fall into this category. In this work, we review both technologies from the perspective of their possible application in future disk drives, opening up new computation paradigms as well as improving the storage characteristics in terms of latency and reliability.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2017.2710217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8013039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2017.2710217","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/8013039/07971925.pdf","startPage":"1790","endPage":"1811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase Change and Magnetic Memories for Solid-State Drive Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Phase Change and Magnetic Memories for Solid-State Drive Applications","volume":"105","issue":"9","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7971925/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17135608","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7971925/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007109","fundingName":"Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Ferrara through the initiative Bando per il finanziamento della ricerca scientifica \u201cFondo per l\u2019Incentivazione alla Ricerca\u201d (FIR), 2016"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase Change and Magnetic Memories for Solid-State Drive Applications","sourcePdf":"jproc-zambelli-2710217-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.203329S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"8013039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8013039","articleId":"7971925","onlineDate":"07 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7971926,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoming Chen","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/8038094/7971926/chen-2724420-small.gif","p":["Xiaoming Chen (M\u201910\u2013SM\u201914) received the B.Sc. degree from Hohai University in 2005, the M.Sc. degree from the Nanjing University of Science and Technology in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2011, all in electronic engineering.

First, we design a new framework for multiple-antenna NOMA, including user clustering, channel state information (CSI) acquisition, superposition coding, transmit beamforming, and successive interference cancellation. Then, we analyze the performance of the considered system, and derive exact closed-form expressions for average transmission rates in terms of transmit power, CSI accuracy, transmission mode, and channel conditions. For further enhancing the system performance, we optimize three key parameters, i.e., transmit power, feedback bits, and transmission mode. Especially, we propose a low-complexity joint optimization scheme, so as to fully exploit the potential of multiple-antenna techniques in NOMA. Moreover, through asymptotic analysis, we reveal the impact of system parameters on average transmission rates, and hence present some guidelines on the design of multiple-antenna NOMA. Finally, simulation results validate our theoretical analysis, and show that a substantial performance gain can be obtained over traditional orthogonal multiple access technology under practical conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7971926/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","volume":"35","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"17171290","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7971926/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Multiple-Antenna Techniques for Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671406"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"LR15F010001"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project of China","grantNumber":"2017ZX03001002-003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Councils Discovery Early Career Researcher Award funding scheme","grantNumber":"DE170100137"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Multiple-Antenna Techniques for Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access","sourcePdf":"jsac-chen-2724420-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.170769S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"8038094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"8038094","articleId":"7971926","onlineDate":"07 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7971927,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenyu Xiao","affiliation":["Collaborative Innovation Center of Geospatial Technology, Wuhan, China","School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7971927/xiao-2724037-small.gif","p":["Zhenyu Xiao (M\u201911\u2013SM\u201917) received the B.E. degree with the Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2011.

However, it may require matrix operations with a scale of antenna size, which is generally large in mmWave communications. Moreover, the channel estimation is also rather time-consuming due to the large number of antennas at both Tx/Rx sides. In this paper, a low-complexity overall channel estimation and hybrid precoding approach is proposed. In the channel estimation phase, a hierarchical multi-beam search scheme is proposed to fast acquire NS (the number of streams) multipath components (MPCs)/clusters with the highest powers. In the hybrid precoding phase, the analog and digital precodings are decoupled. The analog precoding is designed to steer along the NS acquired MPCs/clusters at both Tx/Rx sides, shaping an NS \u00d7 NS baseband effective channel, while the digital precoding is performed in the baseband with the reduced-scale effective channel. Performance evaluations show that, compared with the state-of-the-art scheme, while achieving a close or even better performance when the number of radio frequency chains or streams is small, both the time complexity of the channel estimation and the computational complexity of the hybrid precoding are reduced.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7971927/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","volume":"5","accessionNumber":"17124253","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2017","publicationDate":"2017","htmlLink":"/document/7971927/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Channel Estimation and Hybrid Precoding for Millimeter-Wave MIMO Systems: A Low-Complexity Overall Solution","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571025 and 91538204"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61521091"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Channel Estimation and Hybrid Precoding for Millimeter-Wave MIMO Systems: A Low-Complexity Overall Solution","sourcePdf":"access-xiao-2724037-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110789S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7971927","onlineDate":"07 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7971928,"authors":[{"name":"Aluisio do Nascimento Wrasse","affiliation":["Multiphase Flow Research Center, Federal University of Technology\u2013Paran\u00e1, Curitiba, Brazil"],"bio":{"p":["Alu\u0131sio do Nascimento Wrasse received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Federal University of Santa Maria, Santa Maria, in 2012, and the M.Sc. degree from the Federal University of Technology, Curitiba, Brazil, in 2015, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with focus in sensors and instrumentation applied in multiphase flow monitoring."]},"firstName":"Aluisio do Nascimento","lastName":"Wrasse","id":"37086164800"},{"name":"Tiago Piovesan Vendruscolo","affiliation":["Multiphase Flow Research Center, Federal University of Technology\u2013Paran\u00e1, Curitiba, Brazil"],"bio":{"p":["Tiago Piovesan Vendruscolo received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Federal University of Santa Maria, Santa Maria, Brazil, in 2009, and the M.Sc. and D.Sc. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the Federal University of Technology\u2013Paran\u00e1, Curitiba, Brazil, in 2012 and 2016.

The measuring principle is based on the difference between electrical permittivity of the phases. The sensor consists of two copper rings being an emitter and one receiver ring. The receiver ring is divided into segments, which are individually interrogated by the measuring electronics in a fast manner. In this way, flow images are directly generated from acquired signals of electrodes in a way that it visually represents the investigated flow, avoiding the use of image reconstruction algorithms as usual in tomographic techniques. The sensor is fabricated in a flexible printed-circuit board, which is flush-mounted in the inner pipe wall. A measuring electronics is responsible to detect the capacitance changes in the electrodes. The introduced sensor along with the associated electronics has been tested in static and dynamic two-phase flow, both horizontally and vertically. Direct images were generated in these different situations, showing satisfactory results when compared with a reference wire-mesh sensor.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2017.2724063","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/8118214/07971928.pdf","startPage":"8047","endPage":"8058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2017.2724063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8118214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacitive Multielectrode Direct-Imaging Sensor for the Visualization of Two-Phase Flows","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7971928","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15, 15 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7971928/","displayDocTitle":"Capacitive Multielectrode Direct-Imaging Sensor for the Visualization of Two-Phase Flows","volume":"17","issue":"24","publicationDate":"15 Dec.15, 2017","accessionNumber":"17359740","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7971928/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002322","fundingName":"Brazilian institutions CAPES"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003593","fundingName":"CNPq"},{"fundingName":"ANP"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004225","fundingName":"CENPES/PETROBRAS, Brazil"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacitive Multielectrode Direct-Imaging Sensor for the Visualization of Two-Phase Flows","sourcePdf":"jsen-dasilva-2724063-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086708S","chronDate":"Dec.15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"8118214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8118214","articleId":"7971928","onlineDate":"07 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7971930,"authors":[{"name":"Keer Cui","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8248584/7971930/cui-2719700-small.gif","p":["Keer Cui received the B.Eng. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronics.","His current research interests include switched-mode dc-dc converters, digital class-D amplifiers, and spread-spectrum modulation schemes."]},"firstName":"Keer","lastName":"Cui","orcid":"0000-0002-3709-1343","id":"37086077870"},{"name":"Victor Adrian","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8248584/7971930/adria-2719700-small.gif","p":["Victor Adrian received the B.Eng. degree in electrical and electronic engineering, and the M.Phil. and Ph.D. degrees from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, in 2003, 2004, and 2010, respectively.","He was a Research Associate with the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, NTU.

The proposed scheme is a hybrid of a randomized modulation scheme, namely, the randomized wrapped-around pulse position modulation scheme (RWAPPM), and a noise-shaper. The RWAPPM mitigates the switching-frequency harmonics in the input current, whereas the noise-shaper mitigates the low-frequency noise therein. We derive an analytical expression for the input current spectrum of the hybrid scheme. We benchmark the hybrid scheme against the conventional pulse width modulation scheme (PWM) and the RWAPPM without the noise-shaper. At 0.5 duty cycle, 3.3-V input voltage, 100-kHz average switching frequency, and with the second-order noise-shaper, the peak spectral power in the input current spectrum of the hybrid scheme is 18.1 dB lower than the PWM. Other randomized and spread-spectrum modulation schemes, in general, have undesirably higher input noise current than that of the PWM. However, the input noise current of the proposed hybrid scheme, obtained at ~73-mA rms (integrated over a 200-kHz bandwidth without an input filter), is comparable with that of the PWM, and is lower by ~16-mA rms compared with that of the RWAPPM without the noise-shaper. We also benchmark the hybrid scheme against other well known randomized and spread-spectrum modulation schemes. We further propose a novel pulse generator structure that embodies the hybrid scheme. We realize a dc-dc converter employing the pulse generator, and measure the converter to verify the derived expression and the characteristics of the hybrid scheme. We also measure the output voltage spectrum, the transient-response, and the operating range of the converter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7971930/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","volume":"65","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"17520044","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2018","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7971930/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Noise-Shaped Randomized Modulation for Switched-Mode DC-DC Converters","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore, through the SERC 2013 Public Sector Research Funding","grantNumber":"SERC1321202098"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Noise-Shaped Randomized Modulation for Switched-Mode DC-DC Converters","sourcePdf":"tcsi-cui-2719700-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091579S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8248584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8248584","articleId":"7971930","onlineDate":"07 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7971932,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaohui Yang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8103982/7971932/yang-2724079-small.gif","p":["Zhaohui Yang received the B.S. degree in information science and\n engineering from the Chien-Shiung Wu Honors College, Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2014.

This coupling relation is characterized by the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) coupling model with cell load vector and cell power vector as the variables. Due to the nonlinear SINR coupling model, the optimization problems for multicell networks with load coupling is nonconvex. To solve these nonconvex problems, we first consider the optimization problems for single-cell networks. Through variable transformations, the optimization problems can be equivalently transformed into convex problems. By solving the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker, the optimal solutions to power minimization and rate maximization problems can be obtained in closed form. Based on the theoretical findings of optimization problems for single-cell networks, we develop a distributed time allocation and power control algorithm with low complexity for the sum power minimization in multicell networks. This algorithm is proved to be convergent and globally optimal by using the properties of standard interference function. For sum rate optimization in multicell networks, we also provide a distributed algorithm that yields suboptimal solution. Besides, the convergence for this distributed algorithm is proved. Numerical results illustrate the theoretical findings, showing the superiority of our solutions compared to the conventional solution of allocating uniform power for users in the same cell.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7971932/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7971932/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2017","accessionNumber":"17372490","volume":"66","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Joint Time Allocation and Power Control in Multicell Networks With Load Coupling: Energy Saving and Rate Improvement","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61372106, 61471114 and 61221002"},{"fundingName":"NSTMP","grantNumber":"2016ZX03001016-003"},{"fundingName":"Six Talent Peaks project in Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"GDZB-005"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2242016K41080"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Project of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2014B010119001"},{"fundingName":"Scientific Research Foundation of Graduate School of Southeast University","grantNumber":"YBJJ1650"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Time Allocation and Power Control in Multicell Networks With Load Coupling: Energy Saving and Rate Improvement","sourcePdf":"tvt-pan-2724079-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100513S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8103982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8103982","articleId":"7971932","onlineDate":"07 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7971933,"authors":[{"name":"Jiaji Wu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8279661/7971933/wu-2724205-small.gif","p":["Jiaji Wu received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from\n Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 1996, the M.S. degree from the National Time Service Center, Chinese Academy\n of Sciences, in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Xidian University in 2005.

Image interpolation, which is based on an autoregressive model, has achieved significant improvements compared with the traditional algorithm with respect to image reconstruction, including a better peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and improved subjective visual quality of the reconstructed image. However, the time-consuming computation involved has become a bottleneck in those autoregressive algorithms. Because of the high time cost, image autoregressive-based interpolation algorithms are rarely used in industry for actual production. In this study, in order to meet the requirements of real-time reconstruction, we use diverse compute unified device architecture (CUDA) optimization strategies to make full use of the graphics processing unit (GPU) (NVIDIA Tesla K80), including a shared memory and register and multi-GPU optimization. To be more suitable for the GPU-parallel optimization, we modify the training window to obtain a more concise matrix operation. Experimental results show that, while maintaining a high PSNR and subjective visual quality and taking into account the I/O transfer time, our algorithm achieves a high speedup of 147.3 times for a Lena image and 174.8 times for a 720p video, compared to the original single-threaded C CPU code with -O2 compiling optimization.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8279661/07971933.pdf","startPage":"426","endPage":"436","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doi":"10.1109/TII.2017.2724205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2017.2724205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8279661","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7971933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Autoregressive Interpolation Model Using GPU-Parallel Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Optimization","Graphics processing units","Computational modeling","Informatics","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive processes","computational complexity","graphics processing units","image reconstruction","image resolution","interpolation","parallel architectures","shared memory systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image autoregressive interpolation model","GPU-parallel optimization","consumer electronics industry","ultrahigh definition products","image interpolation","autoregressive model","image reconstruction","peak signal-to-noise ratio","time-consuming computation","autoregressive algorithms","actual production","diverse compute unified device architecture optimization strategies","multiGPU optimization","time complexity","PSNR","improved subjective visual quality","shared memory","CUDA","I-O transfer time"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Autoregressive model","CUDA","GPU","image interpolation","parallel optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7971933/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Image Autoregressive Interpolation Model Using GPU-Parallel Optimization","volume":"14","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7971933/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17574243","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61377011"},{"fundingName":"Shaanxi Science and Technology Department","grantNumber":"2016KTCQ01-116"},{"fundingName":"NRF"},{"fundingName":"Korean Government","grantNumber":"2015R1D1A1A01058171"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Autoregressive Interpolation Model Using GPU-Parallel Optimization","sourcePdf":"tii-jeon-2724205-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096196S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8279661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8279661","articleId":"7971933","onlineDate":"07 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7971936,"authors":[{"name":"Ningyuan Cao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8017677/7971936/cao-2716358-small.gif","p":["Ningyuan Cao (S\u201917) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiaotong University, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Columbia University.

This motivates in situ data analytics in energy-constrained wireless sensor nodes that can perform context-aware acquisition and processing of data; and transmit data only when required. This paper presents a camerabased wireless sensor node with a self-optimizing end-to-end computation and communication design, targeted for surveillance applications. We demonstrate support for multiple featureextraction and classification algorithms, tunable processing depth and power amplifier gain. Depending on the amount of information content, accuracy targets and condition of the wireless channel, the system choses the minimum-energy operating-point by dynamically optimizing the amount of processing done on the sensor itself. We demonstrate a complete system with ADI ADSP-BF707 image processor, OV7670 camera sensor, and USRP B200 software defined radio; and achieve 4.3\u00d7 reduction in energy consumption compared with a baseline design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7971936/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","volume":"64","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"17138841","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7971936/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Self-Optimizing IoT Wireless Video Sensor Node With In-Situ Data Analytics and Context-Driven Energy-Aware Real-Time Adaptation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Semiconductor Research Corporation","grantNumber":"2720.001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Optimizing IoT Wireless Video Sensor Node With In-Situ Data Analytics and Context-Driven Energy-Aware Real-Time Adaptation","sourcePdf":"tcsi-cao-2716358-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127406S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8017677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8017677","articleId":"7971936","onlineDate":"07 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7971937,"authors":[{"name":"Pietro Cairoli","affiliation":["US Corporate Research Center, ABB Inc., Raleigh, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8281552/7971937/cairo-2724145-small.gif","p":["Pietro Cairoli (S\u201910\u2013M\u201914) received Dr. Eng. and\n M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, in 2007 and 2010 respectively.

The power converters independently enter current-limiting mode as soon as they recognize a fault condition and the segmentizing contactors autonomously decide whether or not to open based on their local interpretation of time-to-trip curves as functions of apparent circuit resistance. This method allows converters and contactors to use only local measurements when discerning whether or not to trip in order to isolate the faulted section. Simulation and experimental results show that low-impedance short-circuit faults can be isolated within 10-20 ms and the system can be reenergized within 40-60 ms. The method is effective for a wide range of fault and system configurations, and that range can likely be expanded by applying additional discrimination methods.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8281552/07971937.pdf","startPage":"4535","endPage":"4546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Detection and Isolation in Medium-Voltage DC Microgrids: Coordination Between Supply Power Converters and Bus Contactors","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2017.2724145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8281552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2017.2724145","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7971937","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7971937/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","displayDocTitle":"Fault Detection and Isolation in Medium-Voltage DC Microgrids: Coordination Between Supply Power Converters and Bus Contactors","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"17574831","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"33","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7971937/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-08-1-0080 and N00014-14-1-0165"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Detection and Isolation in Medium-Voltage DC Microgrids: Coordination Between Supply Power Converters and Bus Contactors","sourcePdf":"tpel-cairoli-2724145-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044493S","chronDate":"May  2018","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8281552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"8281552","articleId":"7971937","onlineDate":"07 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7971944,"authors":[{"name":"Lieuwe B.

This paper proposes a compact oscillator-based subsystem that performs precise filtering of asynchronous pulse-width modulation encoded signals and makes extensive use of digital logic, enabling low-voltage operation. First- and second-order primitives are introduced that can be used as TD memory or to enable analogue filtering of TD signals. These structures can be modeled precisely to realize more advanced linear or nonlinear functionality using an ensemble of units. This paper presents the measured results of a prototype fabricated using a 65-nm CMOS technology to realize a fourth-order low-pass Butterworth filter. The system utilizes a 0.5-V supply voltage with asynchronous digital control for closed-loop operation to achieve a 73-nW power budget. The implemented filter achieves a maximum signal to noise and distortion ratio of 53 dB with a narrow 5-kHz bandwidth resulting in an figure-of-merit of 8.2 fJ/pole.

The recognition of such short-lived subtle expressions is a challenging task. The literature proposes several spatio-temporal features to encode the subtle changes on the face during a micro-expression. The spatial changes are almost indistinguishable as the facial appearance does not change appreciably. However, these changes possess a temporal pattern. This paper explores the temporal features associated with facial micro-movements and proposes fuzzy histogram of optical flow orientation (FHOFO) features for recognition of micro-expressions. The FHOFO constructs suitable angular histograms from optical flow vector orientations using histogram fuzzification to encode the temporal pattern for classifying the micro-expressions. We have also discussed the effect of inclusion and exclusion of the motion magnitudes during FHOFO feature extraction. It has been demonstrated by repeated experiments on the publicly available databases, that the performance of FHOFO is consistent and close or at times even better than the state-of-art techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TAFFC.2017.2723386","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAFFC.2017.2723386","startPage":"394","endPage":"406","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165369/8824170/07971947.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8824170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy Histogram of Optical Flow Orientations for Micro-Expression Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7971947/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept. 1 2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy Histogram of Optical Flow Orientations for Micro-Expression Recognition","volume":"10","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2019","accessionNumber":"18954493","publicationDate":"1 July-Sept. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/7971947/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004541","fundingName":"Ministry of Human Resource Development"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy Histogram of Optical Flow Orientations for Micro-Expression Recognition","sourcePdf":"taffc-happy-2723386-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106221S","chronDate":"July-Sept. 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"5165369","isNumber":"8824170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165369","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"8824170","articleId":"7971947","onlineDate":"07 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7971948,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Alsharoa","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7511293/8085203/7971948/alsha-2724438-small.gif","p":["Ahmad Alsharoa (S\u201914) was born in Irbid, Jordan.

It enables additional efficiency and increased lifetime to wireless networks. This paper investigates a multiple-relay selection scheme for an EH-based two-way relaying (TWR) system. All relays are considered EH nodes that harvest energy from renewable energy and radio frequency (RF) sources. Some of them are selected to forward data to the destinations. The power splitting (PS) protocol, by which the EH node splits the input RF signal into two components for EH and information transmission, is adopted at the relay nodes. The objective is to jointly optimize: 1) the set of selected relays; 2) their PS ratios; and 3) their transmit power levels in order to maximize data rate-based utilities over multiple coherent time slots. A joint-optimization solution based on geometric programming (GP) and binary particle swarm optimization is proposed to solve non-convex problems for two utility functions reflecting the level of fairness in the TWR transmission. Numerical results illustrate the system\u2019s behavior versus various parameters and show that the performance of the proposed scheme is very close to that of the optimal branch-and-bound method and that GP outperforms the dual problem-based method.","doi":"10.1109/TGCN.2017.2724438","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/7511293/8085203/07971948.pdf","startPage":"444","endPage":"457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8085203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGCN.2017.2724438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of a Power Splitting Protocol for Two-Way Multiple Energy Harvesting Relay System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7971948","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of a Power Splitting Protocol for Two-Way Multiple Energy Harvesting Relay System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7971948/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7971948/","volume":"1","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of a Power Splitting Protocol for Two-Way Multiple Energy Harvesting Relay System","sourcePdf":"tgcn-ghazzai-2724438-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162597S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7511293","isNumber":"8085203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7511293","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"8085203","articleId":"7971948","onlineDate":"07 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7971958,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Ke Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan","Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8248584/7971958/tsai-2715339-small.gif","p":["Ming-Ke Tsai received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 2012 and 2014, respectively.","After receiving the M.S. degree, he was an Engineer with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd., Hsinchu, Taiwan.

While phenomena, such as bias temperature instability (BTI) scale down with Vdd, mitigate their magnified impact with reduced degradations and, thus, have little impact on NTC reliability. Process variation (PV) and random telegraph noise (RTN) do not scale with Vdd and, therefore, become key reliability challenges in NTC. On the other hand, in super-threshold computing (STC), PV and BTI are the dominant phenomena, as BTI induces considerable degradations at nominal Vdd and PV imposes large enough shifts to matter at any supply voltage. Therefore, to allow Vdd-scaling from superto near-threshold, we need to consider all of BTI, RTN, and PV. Ergo, we present a unified RTN and BTI model that models their shared physical origin and is validated against experimental data across a wide voltage range. Our unified model and PV model capture the joint impact of RTN, BTI, and PV within a probabilistic reliability estimation for NTC and STC circuits. We employed our proposed model to analyze the reliability of SRAM cells showing how taking error correction codes into account is able to mitigate the deleterious effects of BTI, RTN, and PV by 36% compared with unprotected circuits.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2017.2717790","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2017.2717790","startPage":"293","endPage":"306","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/8248584/07971963.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8248584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability in Super- and Near-Threshold Computing: A Unified Model of RTN, BTI, and PV","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7971963/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Reliability in Super- and Near-Threshold Computing: A Unified Model of RTN, BTI, and PV","volume":"65","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2018","accessionNumber":"17520024","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7971963/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001659","fundingName":"German Research Foundation (DFG) through the Dependable Embedded Systems Priority Program","grantNumber":"SPP 1500"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003329","fundingName":"Spanish MINECO and ERDF","grantNumber":"TEC2013-45638-C3-1-R"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002809","fundingName":"Generalitat de Catalunya","grantNumber":"2014SGR-384"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability in Super- and Near-Threshold Computing: A Unified Model of RTN, BTI, and PV","sourcePdf":"tcsi-vansanten-2717790-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141862S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8248584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8248584","articleId":"7971963","onlineDate":"07 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7971965,"authors":[{"name":"Honglei Lin","affiliation":["Heilongjiang University, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"p":["Honglei Lin was born in Heilongjiang, China, in 1986.

Different sensors uniformly sample measurements with different sampling rates and time delays. First, a new state-space model at the measurement sampling points is constructed and the original time delayed system is transformed to a delay-free one with correlated noises in limited time intervals to obtain the real-time estimation. Based on the new state-space model, the optimal local filter at the measurement sampling points is obtained for each single-sensor subsystem, and then the local estimator at the state update points is derived by using the predictor based on the filter at the measurement sampling points. Then, the estimation error cross-covariance matrices between any two local estimators are derived. Finally, the real-time distributed fusion estimator at the state update points is obtained based on the optimal fusion criterion weighed by matrices in the linear unbiased minimum variance sense. Besides, to avoid the correlation between system and measurement noises in the developed state-space model, a simple alternative but nonreal-time estimation fusion algorithm is also presented by employing dummy measurements. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2017.2724398","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/8167337/07971965.pdf","startPage":"3020","endPage":"3031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2017.2724398","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Solution to Estimation Fusion for Multirate Measurements with Delays","volume":"53","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7971965/","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17414836","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7971965/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61573132 and 61174139"},{"fundingName":"Heilongjiang Province Outstanding Youth","grantNumber":"JC201412"},{"fundingName":"Chang Jiang Scholar Candidates Program for Provincial Universities in Heilongjiang","grantNumber":"2013CJHB005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Solution to Estimation Fusion for Multirate Measurements with Delays","sourcePdf":"taes-sun-2724398-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103525S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"8167337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8167337","articleId":"7971965","onlineDate":"07 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":7971968,"authors":[{"name":"Li Zhu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8207705/7971968/zhu-2724060-small.gif","p":["Li Zhu received the Ph.D. degree in traffic control and information\n engineering from Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China, in 2012.

This paper studies the joint optimization of communication and control in CBTC systems. With the objective to minimize the optimal operation profile tracking error and energy consumption, linear quadratic cost is defined as the control performance measure. In order to ensure train operation safety, the optimization model puts constraints on train control actions related to safety. Moreover, based on the stochastic channel characteristics and the real-time train position information, handoff decision and train control policy are jointly optimized using deep reinforcement learning. Extensive simulation results based on real-field channel measurements illustrate that the proposed optimization method can significantly improve the train control performance in CBTC systems, and CBTC systems need to sacrifice part of performance to ensure system safety.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8207705/07971968.pdf","startPage":"10705","endPage":"10717","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2724060","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2724060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8207705","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7971968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Communication-Based Train Control System Performance Optimization Using Deep Reinforcement Learning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Safety","Learning (artificial intelligence)","Railway transportation","Control systems","Optimization","Delays","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","mobility management (mobile radio)","optimisation","rail traffic control","railway communication","railway safety","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous train-ground communications","bidirectional train-ground communications","urban rail CBTC train-ground communication performance","CBTC operation efficiency","optimal operation profile tracking error","train operation safety","handoff decision","deep reinforcement learning","train control system performance optimization","train position information","communication-based train control system","energy consumption","linear quadratic cost","stochastic channel characteristics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Communication systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","train control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7971968/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Communication-Based Train Control System Performance Optimization Using Deep Reinforcement Learning","volume":"66","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7971968/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416513","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communication-Based Train Control System Performance Optimization Using Deep Reinforcement Learning","sourcePdf":"tvt-yu-2724060-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083631S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8207705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8207705","articleId":"7971968","onlineDate":"07 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7971970,"authors":[{"name":"Szu-Chi Chung","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8017677/7971970/chung-2698063-small.gif","p":["Szu-Chi Chung received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2011, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electronics engineering.

Because no active SI cancellation is deployed at the relay station, there is no need for SI channel estimation. We derive an approximate closed-form achievable rate expression for ZF processing with statistical CSI. When the number of antennas of the transmit and receive arrays at the relay station is sufficiently large, the transmit powers of each source and the relay station can be significantly scaled down proportionally to the number of antennas. Since Rayleigh fading is a special case of Rician fading, the results in this paper hold for Rayleigh fading channels.

We analyze the average sum throughput of D2D receivers in interference-limited channels. To enhance it, we propose a semi-distributed spectrum access scheme, which consists of two stages. In the first stage, the cellular base station divides whole D2D transmitters into multiple groups and assigns a different subchannel to each group. In the second stage, D2D transmitters in each group randomly access the subchannel assigned to it with predetermined access probability. We formulate an optimization problem to find groups and access probabilities, which maximize the average sum throughput. To overcome the prohibitive computational complexity to obtain its optimal solution, we decompose it into two subproblems: one to find groups and one to find access probabilities. A heuristic grouping algorithm is adopted to solve the former, and a branch-and-bound-based algorithm is proposed to solve the latter with achieving a target accuracy. The validity of the branch-and-bound-based algorithm is shown by performance comparison with an exhaustive search. It is shown that the heuristic grouping and the branch-and-bound-based algorithm achieve higher average sum throughput than conventional methods.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2724028","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2724028","startPage":"4572","endPage":"4582","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8068314/07971976.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8068314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-Distributed Spectrum Access to Enhance Throughput for Underlay Device-to-Device Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7971976/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Semi-Distributed Spectrum Access to Enhance Throughput for Underlay Device-to-Device Communications","volume":"65","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17256476","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7971976/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) and Institute for Information and communications Technology Promotion (IITP) grant funded by the Korea Government (MOE and MSIT)","grantNumber":"2015R1D1A1A01057563, 2016K2A9A2A15003484 and B0115-16-0001"},{"fundingName":"5G Communication with a Heterogeneous, Agile Mobile network in the PyeongChang wInter Olympic competioN)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-Distributed Spectrum Access to Enhance Throughput for Underlay Device-to-Device Communications","sourcePdf":"tcomm-park-2724028-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.266681S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8068314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8068314","articleId":"7971976","onlineDate":"07 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7971987,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Pedross-Engel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8248584/7971987/pedro-2717979-small.gif","p":["Andreas Pedross-Engel (S\u201910\u2013M\u201914) received the Dipl.Ing. degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in information and communications engineering from the Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria, in 2009 and 2014, respectively.","From 2008 to 2009, he was with Infineon Technologies Austria AG, where he was a Concept Engineer with a focus on signal processing for low-power receiver designs.

In conventional RF front ends, for example, they are widely used for frequency conversion tasks. In noncoherent energy detectors or autocorrelation receivers, they multiply the (broadband) input signal by itself to achieve a down-conversion. Unfortunately, there exist no ideal hardware realizations of such devices, hence multipliers inevitably create undesired signal content at their output. To be able to deal with these effects or correct for them, we need to be able to model and identify realistic RF multipliers. This paper proposes and validates a multiple-input single-output Wiener-Hammerstein model for ultra-wideband (UWB) analog multipliers. The structure of the proposed model gives insight in the distortions created. It thus provides the possibility to study the realistic behavior of systems involving those multipliers, e.g., the influence of undesired nonlinear signal content onto noncoherent UWB receivers. A comparison of the model performance is shown with respect to measurements and circuit simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2017.2717979","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/8248584/07971987.pdf","startPage":"283","endPage":"292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8248584","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2017.2717979","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Identification of Ultra-Wideband Analog Multipliers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7971987","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Identification of Ultra-Wideband Analog Multipliers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7971987/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17520051","htmlLink":"/document/7971987/","volume":"65","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004955","fundingName":"Noncoherent Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Project, a collaborative project funded by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG)","grantNumber":"825899"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Identification of Ultra-Wideband Analog Multipliers","sourcePdf":"tcsi-pedrossengel-2717979-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095149S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8248584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8248584","articleId":"7971987","onlineDate":"07 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7971993,"authors":[{"name":"Zhicong Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8281552/7971993/zhico-2724039-small.gif","p":["Zhicong Huang (S\u201914) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical\n engineering and automation and the M.Sc. degree in mechanical and electronic engineering, both from Huazhong\n University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2010 and 2013, respectively.

To achieve maximum efficiency, it is common to cascade the IPT converter with front-side and load-side dc/dc converters. The two dc/dc converters are normally controlled cooperatively for the requirements of output regulation and maximum efficiency tracking using a control technique based on perturbation and observation, which is inevitably slow in response. In this paper, a decoupled control technique is developed. The load-side dc/dc converter is solely responsible for output regulation, while the front-side converter is responsible for impedance-matching of the IPT converter by controlling its input-to-output voltage ratio. The controls are linear and therefore fast. DC and small-signal transfer functions are derived for designing the control parameters. The performances of fast regulation and high efficiency of the IPT converter system are verified using a prototype system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control Design for Optimizing Efficiency in Inductive Power Transfer Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2017.2724039","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8281552/07971993.pdf","startPage":"4523","endPage":"4534","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2017.2724039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8281552","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7971993","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7971993/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","displayDocTitle":"Control Design for Optimizing Efficiency in Inductive Power Transfer Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7971993/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"17574845","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004377","fundingName":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control Design for Optimizing Efficiency in Inductive Power Transfer Systems","sourcePdf":"tpel-wong-2724039-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094646S","chronDate":"May  2018","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8281552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"8281552","articleId":"7971993","onlineDate":"07 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7971994,"authors":[{"name":"Nadine Marie Moacdieh","affiliation":["Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221037/8105908/7971994/moacd-2717899-small.gif","p":["Nadine Marie Moacdieh received the B.E. degree in computer and\n communications engineering from the American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon, in 2010, and the M.E. and Ph.D.\n degrees in industrial and operations engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, in 2012 and\n 2015, respectively.","She is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, American\n University of Beirut, which she joined in 2015.

The differential contributions of the two main aspects of clutter- data density and display organization-to these breakdowns are not well understood. Moreover, it is not clear how these factors interact with stress, another factor that can degrade performance in data-rich domains. The aim of this study was to ascertain the effects of data density, display organization, and stress on visual search performance and associated eye movements (obtained via eye tracking). To this end, participants performed visual search tasks in a simulated graphics program. Data density (number of icons), organization (grouping of icons), and stress (presence of a time limit) were manipulated. Response time (RT), error rate, eye tracking data, and subjective ratings of clutter and stress were collected. Results confirmed that high data density and poor organization increase RT and error rate. Furthermore, poor organization worsened the effects of high data density on RT. Stress did not negatively affect performance but significantly decreased RT. Eye tracking metrics provided insight into the effects of the two clutter aspects and stress. In particular, these metrics helped explain how changes in attention allocation resulted in the observed performance effects of long RT and high error rate. The results of this research can be used to inform the design of data-rich displays and trigger display adaptations in real time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7971994/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7971994/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2017","accessionNumber":"17372770","volume":"47","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Effects of Data Density, Display Organization, and Stress on Search Performance: An Eye Tracking Study of Clutter","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006801","fundingName":"Rackham Graduate School"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007270","fundingName":"University of Michigan","grantNumber":"U043054"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006282","fundingName":"Federal Aviation Administration","grantNumber":"10-G-022"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effects of Data Density, Display Organization, and Stress on Search Performance: An Eye Tracking Study of Clutter","sourcePdf":"thms-moacdieh-2717899-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12513S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6221037","isNumber":"8105908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221037","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8105908","articleId":"7971994","onlineDate":"07 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7972092,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The TV White spaces, the scarcely used bands of former analog TV broadcasting, could be a viable option to alleviate this problem. The concept of Cognitive Radio must be employed though, as primary users within the TV White Spaces must not be disturbed. While the idea of Cognitive Radio is nothing new to system engineers and a considerable amount of research has been done on high level aspects, it is the author's intention to shed some light on yet missed low level issues, physical implications and limitations that are major showstoppers for cognitive radio technology as it exists today. As well, this paper presents a low-cost, non-specialized and proven hardware architecture that solves these problems and enables experimental over-the-air cognitive radio research. The presented architecture takes its input from e.g. commercial LTE transceivers and shifts the center frequency towards the TV white spaces, while maintaining standard compliance towards LTE, thereby turning the commercial LTE transceiver into a Cognitive Radio transceiver, which is adhering to the LTE requirements. Transceivers that have been augmented this way gain flexibility in regard to center frequency without loosing anything. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the presented hardware is the first and only possibility, in which arbitrary center frequencies can be combined with standard compliant LTE signals, leaving e.g. spectrum mask, spurious emissions and EVM requirements undisturbed.","doi":"10.1109/LANMAN.2017.7972176","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Local and Metropolitan Area Networks (LANMAN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Local and Metropolitan Area Networks (LANMAN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7963870/7972123/07972176.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LANMAN.2017.7972176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7972123","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A proven MIMO capable TDD/FDD frequency converter enabling cognitive features for LTE transceivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7972176","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 June 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7972176/","displayDocTitle":"A proven MIMO capable TDD/FDD frequency converter enabling cognitive features for LTE transceivers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17014637","htmlLink":"/document/7972176/","conferenceDate":"12-14 June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A proven MIMO capable TDD/FDD frequency converter enabling cognitive features for LTE transceivers","confLoc":"Osaka, Japan","sourcePdf":"lanman17-final6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054394S","chronDate":"12-14 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7963870","isNumber":"7972123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7963870","xplore-issue":"7972123","articleId":"7972176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7972195,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Bazzi","affiliation":["CNR-IEIIT, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Bazzi","id":"37552991200"},{"name":"Barbara M.

Since the main service expected for connected vehicles is the cooperative awareness, in this work we aim at deriving the number of neighbors that can be managed by LTE-V2V. In addition to the normal half duplex (HD) radios, which strictly limit the granularity of resource allocation, advanced full duplex (FD) radios are also considered.

From the perspective of antenna correlation, the system throughput under linear arrays and circular arrays are simulated. The results show that the system throughput in the 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO system using space division multiplexing can be doubled compared to SISO, and the MIMO system using spatial diversity can achieve the maximum throughput of the system same as SISO. For a 2-element antenna array, a linear array placed perpendicular to the rails provides better system performance. For a 4-element antenna array, a circular array with a certain angle between the normal and the rail direction is better than a linear array in a restricted placement area.","doi":"10.1109/ITST.2017.7972211","publicationTitle":"2017 15th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications (ITST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 15th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications (ITST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7963872/7972185/07972211.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITST.2017.7972211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7972185","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO antenna configuration for LTE in railway","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7972211","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO antenna configuration for LTE in railway","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 May 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7972211/","conferenceDate":"29-31 May 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17014781","dateOfInsertion":"11 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7972211/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO antenna configuration for LTE in railway","confLoc":"Warsaw, Poland","sourcePdf":"Paper23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087699S","chronDate":"29-31 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7963872","isNumber":"7972185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7963872","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7972185","articleId":"7972211","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7972237,"authors":[{"name":"Jyothi A.P","affiliation":["RRCE Research centre, Bangalore Visvesvaraya Technological University, Belgaum, India"],"lastName":"Jyothi A.P","id":"37086094684"},{"name":"Usha Sakthivel","affiliation":["Dept. of CSE, Rajarajeswari College of Engg, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Usha","lastName":"Sakthivel","id":"37973116300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6221-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-6220-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6222-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7972237","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Wireless sensor networks","Data aggregation","Clustering algorithms","Energy efficiency","Algorithm design and analysis","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinatorial mathematics","data aggregation","energy conservation","linear programming","pattern clustering","telecommunication power management","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CFCLP-A","clustering framework","combinatorial approach","linear programming","wireless sensor network","data aggregation","clustering mechanism","cluster-head majorly","energy effectiveness","analytical modeling","mathematical modeling","MEMSIC nodes","energy saving performance","data delivery"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clustering","Wireless Sensor Network","Energy Efficiency","Selection of Cluster Head","Network Lifetime"]}],"abstract":"It is widely known that the process and performance of data aggregation in wireless sensor network is dependent on the effectiveness of clustering mechanism. However, existing research work towards clustering mechanism has been found to focus on selection on cluster-head majorly on the basis on energy. This is the prime reason for which the energy effectiveness has not completely been achieved in wireless sensor network. The present paper introduces a novel analytical modeling of CFCLP that leverages data aggregation by a novel combinatorial approach using linear programming for evolving up with a new clustering mechanism. A sophisticated mathematical modeling is used for designing and its algorithm being implemented on MEMSIC nodes to find that CFCLP is capable of maintaining good balance between energy saving performance and data delivery among the sensor nodes for longer iterations.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCT2.2017.7972237","publicationTitle":"2017 2nd International Conference on Computing and Communications Technologies (ICCCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 2nd International Conference on Computing and Communications Technologies (ICCCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7965811/7972234/07972237.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCT2.2017.7972237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7972234","startPage":"49","endPage":"54","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CFCLP-a novel Clustering Framework based on Combinatorial approach and Linear Programming in Wireless Sensor Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7972237","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"CFCLP-a novel Clustering Framework based on Combinatorial approach and Linear Programming in Wireless Sensor Network","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-24 Feb. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7972237/","conferenceDate":"23-24 Feb. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"17015155","dateOfInsertion":"11 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7972237/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CFCLP-a novel Clustering Framework based on Combinatorial approach and Linear Programming in Wireless Sensor Network","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"RP-002-024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108135S","chronDate":"23-24 Feb. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7965811","isNumber":"7972234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7965811","xplore-issue":"7972234","articleId":"7972237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7972244,"authors":[{"name":"M.

If the proximity range of the Bluetooth exceeds the data is switched to the Zigbee. Zigbee has the better proximity range than Bluetooth. If the proximity range of Zigbee exceeds the data is transferred via Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi has a better coverage than Zigbee. If the Wi-Fi proximity exceeds the data is transferred via GSM.

An energy model for Virtual Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (V-MIMO) cooperative communication using turbo codes is also presented. The proposed technique is energy efficient as it requires lesser transmit energy per bit when compared to conventional uncoded schemes. The energy consumption of uncoded cooperative communication is compared with coded cooperative communication. The effect of code rate, number of participating nodes, channel conditions, target Bit Error Rate (BER) on the total energy consumption is also investigated. From the simulation results, it is evident that the proposed turbo coded cooperative communication with BPSK achieves energy saving of 11.36% when compared with the respective uncoded cooperative communication.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficient V-MIMO using turbo codes in Wireless Sensor Networks","publicationTitle":"2017 2nd International Conference on Computing and Communications Technologies (ICCCT)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCT2.2017.7972288","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 2nd International Conference on Computing and Communications Technologies (ICCCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7965811/7972234/07972288.pdf","startPage":"293","endPage":"298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCT2.2017.7972288","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7972234","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7972288","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7972288/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-24 Feb. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficient V-MIMO using turbo codes in Wireless Sensor Networks","conferenceDate":"23-24 Feb. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7972288/","dateOfInsertion":"11 July 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"17015132","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficient V-MIMO using turbo codes in Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"RP-053-138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05657S","chronDate":"23-24 Feb. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7965811","isNumber":"7972234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7965811","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7972234","articleId":"7972288","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7972321,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In order to ensure the ability of natural ester as potential replacement for liquid insulation, statistical analysis of AC breakdown strength is conducted apart from measuring the other oil properties such as density, viscosity, flash point, fire point, color, moisture content and acidity. Statistical analysis of breakdown voltage on corn oil is carried out with two parametric distributions (Normal and Weibull distribution). The probability of failure with respect to the breakdown voltage on corn oil and at risk levels of 1%, 5%, 10%, 25% and 50% probability are estimated to ensure the withstand capacity of corn oil under various stress conditions. For reference purpose, mineral oil is also investigated in this work. From the statistical investigation result, it is found that the corn oil has the suitable and better breakdown characteristics than the mineral oil. Hence the corn oil has the potential to replace traditional mineral oil in high voltage transformer.","doi":"10.1109/AEEICB.2017.7972324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7972316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AEEICB.2017.7972324","publicationTitle":"2017 Third International Conference on Advances in Electrical, Electronics, Information, Communication and Bio-Informatics (AEEICB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Third International Conference on Advances in Electrical, Electronics, Information, Communication and Bio-Informatics (AEEICB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966449/7972316/07972324.pdf","startPage":"320","endPage":"323","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A statistical study on the AC breakdown voltage of corn oil and mineral oil for liquid insulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-28 Feb. 2017","displayDocTitle":"A statistical study on the AC breakdown voltage of corn oil and mineral oil for liquid insulation","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7972324/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"17015172","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7972324/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A statistical study on the AC breakdown voltage of corn oil and mineral oil for liquid insulation","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"paper107.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051176S","chronDate":"27-28 Feb. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7966449","isNumber":"7972316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966449","xplore-issue":"7972316","articleId":"7972324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7972330,"authors":[{"name":"Dibyendu Khan","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Netaji Subhash Engineering College, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Dibyendu","lastName":"Khan","id":"37086072143"},{"name":"Sankhadip Saha","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Netaji Subhash Engineering College, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Sankhadip","lastName":"Saha","id":"37085362107"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5434-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5435-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7972330","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7972330","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Discrete wavelet transforms","MOSFET","Feature extraction","Fault detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","cycloconvertors","discrete wavelet transforms","failure analysis","fault diagnosis","multilayer perceptrons","power engineering computing","power MOSFET"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DWT","discrete wavelet transform","fault removal time minimization","power MOSFET","PNN","probabilistic neural network","BPMLP based ANN","backpropagation multilayer perceptron based artificial neural network","substantial signature extraction","faulty component path detection","frequency control","AC motor","real time component failure diagnosis","wavelet decomposition method","neural network based cycloconverter fault detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cycloconverter","fault","wavelet decomposition","BPMLP","PNN"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AEEICB.2017.7972330","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966449/7972316/07972330.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 Third International Conference on Advances in Electrical, Electronics, Information, Communication and Bio-Informatics (AEEICB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Third International Conference on Advances in Electrical, Electronics, Information, Communication and Bio-Informatics (AEEICB)","startPage":"352","endPage":"356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7972316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AEEICB.2017.7972330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based cycloconverter fault detection using wavelet decomposition","abstract":"Power electronic devices may fail to function normally due to unexpected breakdown of various power electronic component.

To promote the lowest PAPR a \u03bc-law and A-law companding is used without amplifying the complexity.","doi":"10.1109/AEEICB.2017.7972334","publicationTitle":"2017 Third International Conference on Advances in Electrical, Electronics, Information, Communication and Bio-Informatics (AEEICB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Third International Conference on Advances in Electrical, Electronics, Information, Communication and Bio-Informatics (AEEICB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966449/7972316/07972334.pdf","startPage":"371","endPage":"374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AEEICB.2017.7972334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7972316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR reduction in OFDM using reduced complexity PTS with companding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7972334","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Feb. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7972334/","displayDocTitle":"PAPR reduction in OFDM using reduced complexity PTS with companding","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"17040123","htmlLink":"/document/7972334/","conferenceDate":"27-28 Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR reduction in OFDM using reduced complexity PTS with companding","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"paper120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057424S","chronDate":"27-28 Feb. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7966449","isNumber":"7972316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966449","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7972316","articleId":"7972334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7972344,"authors":[{"name":"Thota Sravanti","affiliation":["Department of ECE, CVR college of Engineering, Hyderabad, Telangana, India"],"firstName":"Thota","lastName":"Sravanti","id":"37085500123"},{"name":"N Vasantha","affiliation":["Department of IT, Vasavi college of Engineering, Hyderabad, Telangana, India"],"firstName":"N","lastName":"Vasantha","id":"37298029200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5434-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5435-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7972344","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Partial transmit sequences","Computational complexity","Interference","Time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PTS","partial transmit sequence","BER performance","OBI","out-of-band-interference","companding technique","wireless communication physical layer","distinct PAPR reductions","peak-to-average power ratio","OFDM","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Companding","OFDM","PAPR","PTS"]}],"abstract":"The fundamental block of wireless communication physical layer is Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). The main issue elevated in OFDM is high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Distinct PAPR reductions have been proposed to reduce high PAPR.

Such massive deployment of IoT sensors and devices would certainly cost a large sum of money. In addition to the cost of deployment, the running costs or the operational expenditure of the IoT networks will incur huge power bills and spectrum license charges. As IoT is going to be a pervasive technology, its sustainability and environmental effects too are important. Energy efficiency and overall resource optimization would make it the long term technology of the future.

Hierarchical and Density based ways are implemented for constructing minimum Spanning Tree; the MST can be divided into two segments. In the first segment, local density is guesstimate at every data point. In the subsequent segment, hierarchical ways are used by combining clusters according to the calculated cluster distance based to go-beyond in distribution of data objects. The recommended method improvises the efficiency of clustering result, where the data is distributed in different shapes and density; it leads to better clustering efficiency. This approach presents a clustering algorithm that is inspired by MST.

Lock-In Amplifier","abstract":"Advancements in microgrids and distributed generated systems have created an impetus to distribute protection and management functions throughout a grid. Instead of using a centralized scheduling and protection system, each converter in the grid is expected to contribute to these functions. Many techniques based on impedance detection have been proposed as means to locate faults on a microgrid; however, many of them are not suitable or are too intrusive for a DC microgrid. An accurate detection of the grid impedance (both in magnitude and phase) allows for the accurate detection of the fault, and reduces the effort needed to clear it, in the event that it is necessary to do so. In this work, a novel fault location technique based on a Lock-In Amplifier (LIA) is introduced. This technique makes use of advanced digital algorithms to allow for the accurate detection of the fault location with minimal perturbation of the system's operations. By using both the magnitude and phase of the impedance, the algorithm is able to determine a location based on resistance and inductance, thereby mitigating the effects of errors from any single source. The proposed technique provides three key benefits: 1) high noise immunity, 2) low computational cost, and 3) low perturbation size; moreover, it provides these benefits while also maintaining a high level of accuracy. Simulations of the proposed measurement technique are presented in order to illustrate its behavior, along with experimental validation under different faults.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7972489/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7972489/","dateOfInsertion":"11 July 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"17014864","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Embedded fault location in DC microgrid systems based on a Lock-In Amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embedded fault location in DC microgrid systems based on a Lock-In Amplifier","confLoc":"Florianopolis, Brazil","sourcePdf":"168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061532S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7963949","isNumber":"7972437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7963949","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7972437","articleId":"7972489","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7972506,"authors":[{"name":"Namwon Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC), Charlotte, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Namwon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086059436"},{"name":"Babak Parkhideh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC), Charlotte, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Babak","lastName":"Parkhideh","id":"37391713600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5339-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5340-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-5767"}],"articleNumber":"7972506","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":403},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Virtual machine monitors","Power generation","Batteries","Voltage control","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decentralised control","electric current measurement","energy storage","invertors","power grids","solar cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ramp-rate control strategy","distributed PV-ESS AC-stacked inverter architecture","photovoltaic output variations","PV output variations","energy storage system","modular panel-level grid-connected single-phase PV inverter architecture","distributed PV-ESS AC-stacked inverter","control capability","decentralized manner","communication minimization","local AC string current measurement","controller hardware-in-the- loop test","CHIL test"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AC-stacked PV inverter architecture","cascaded inverters","energy storage","PV output variation","ramp-rate control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7972506","abstract":"Ramp-rate control smooths out sudden photovoltaic (PV) output variations by charging and discharging electricity through an energy storage system (ESS).

The modular inverter members including PV inverters and ESS are connected in series and regulating each member's output in decentralized manner. To minimize the communication requirements between the PV inverters and the ESS, the ESS utilizes the local AC string current measurement to detect PV output variations for the ramp-rate control.

A nodewise probability tracer is adopted at each variable node (VN) in order to achieve a BER performance comparable to the normalized min-sum algorithm, where check-to-variable (C2V) messages are used as inputs, rather than the variable-to-check (V2C) messages adopted in previous stochastic decoders. The complexity of the VN units is greatly reduced by sharing common units used in the generation of V2C messages together with a probability tracer. The C2V-based probability tracer enables the design of a decoder that provides a short critical path.

As a promising RAT for 5G cellular networks, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has attracted extensive research attentions. Compared with the orthogonal multiple access (OMA) that has been widely applied in existing wireless communication systems, NOMA possesses the potential to further improve the system spectral efficiency and connectivity capability. This paper develops analytical frameworks for NOMA downlink and uplink multi-cell wireless systems to evaluate the system outage probability and average achievable rate. In the downlink NOMA system, two different NOMA group pairing schemes are considered, based on which theoretical results on outage and achievable data rates are derived. In the uplink NOMA, revised back-off power control scheme is applied, and outage probability and per UE average achievable rate are derived. As wireless networks turn into more and more densely deployed, inter-cell interference has become a dominant capacity limiting factor but has not been addressed in most of the existing NOMA studies. In this paper, a stochastic geometry approach is used to model a dense wireless system, that supports NOMA on both uplink and downlink, based on which analytical results are derived either in pseudo-closed forms or succinct closed forms and are further validated by simulations. Numerical results demonstrate that NOMA can bring considerable system-wide performance gain compared with OMA on both uplink and downlink when properly designed.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/49/8225762/7972929-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7972929/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","volume":"35","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"17431663","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7972929/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Downlink and Uplink Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access in a Dense Wireless Network","openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Downlink and Uplink Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access in a Dense Wireless Network","sourcePdf":"jsac-zhang-2724646-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099556S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"8225762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"8225762","articleId":"7972929","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7972930,"authors":[{"name":"Sheikh Aamir Ahsan","affiliation":["Nanolab, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245494/8015129/7972930/ahsan-2724839-small.gif","p":["Sheikh Aamir Ahsan (GS\u201915) was born in Srinagar, India, in 1988.

Parasitic capacitances, gate finger resistance, and extrinsic bus-inductances are extracted, from a single set of measured non-cold-FET S-parameters, using the model process design kit.

An amplify-and-forward relaying method is considered, where the relay node harvests energy from the received signal power to charge its battery, which is used to forward the received signal to the destination. We also consider a direct link between the source and the destination. The direct link signal can be combined with the relaying signal at the destination node using maximum ratio combining. Under the delay-limited transmission mode, closed form expressions for outage probability are derived for a battery-enabled relay. Our analytical results reveal the advantage of cooperative relay networks with a direct link. Also, we extend our design to a multiple-relay scenario, where the best relay is selected from the available number of relays, based on the information of relay locations.

For both terrestrial networks and the satellite network, multi-antennas are equipped and beamforming techniques are utilized to serve multiple users simultaneously. A channel quality-based scheme is proposed to select users for the satellite, and we then formulate the terrestrial user pairing as a max-min problem to maximize the minimum channel correlation between users in one NOMA group. Since the terrestrial networks and the satellite network will cause interference to each other, we first investigate the capacity performance of the terrestrial networks and the satellite networks separately, which can be decomposed into the designing of beamforming vectors and the power allocation schemes. Then, a joint iteration algorithm is proposed to maximize the total system capacity, where we introduce the interference temperature limit for the satellite since the satellite can cause interference to all base station users. Finally, numerical results are provided to evaluate the user paring scheme as well as the total system performance, in comparison with some other proposed algorithms and existing algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2017.2724478","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2017.2724478","startPage":"2253","endPage":"2267","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/8038094/07972935.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038094","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Based Integrated Terrestrial-Satellite Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7972935/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Based Integrated Terrestrial-Satellite Networks","volume":"35","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17171302","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7972935/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"91438206, 91638205, 91538203 and 61621091"},{"fundingName":"Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by CAST"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Based Integrated Terrestrial-Satellite Networks","sourcePdf":"jsac-jiang-2724478-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104232S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"8038094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"8038094","articleId":"7972935","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7972937,"authors":[{"name":"Yuichi Kawamoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8059894/7972937/kawam-2724642-small.gif","p":["Yuichi Kawamoto (GS\u201911\u2013M\u201916) received the B.E. degree in information engineering from Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Graduate School of Information Science (GSIS), Tohoku University, in 2013 and 2016, respectively.","He has been an Assistant Professor with the GSIS, Tohoku University since 2011.","Dr. Kawamoto was a recipient of the prestigious Deans and Presidents Awards from Tohoku University in 2016 and several Best Paper Awards at conferences including IWCMC\u201913, GLOBECOM\u201913, and WCNC\u20192014."]},"firstName":"Yuichi","lastName":"Kawamoto","orcid":"0000-0002-5290-6520","id":"38247039800"},{"name":"Naoto Yamada","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8059894/7972937/yamad-2724642-small.gif","p":["Naoto Yamada (GS\u201915\u2013M\u201917) received the B.E. degree in information engineering from Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, in 2015, where he is currently pursuing the M.S. degree at the Graduate School of Information Sciences.","His current research interests include Internet of Things and wireless networking."]},"firstName":"Naoto","lastName":"Yamada","orcid":"0000-0002-6836-3639","id":"37086101434"},{"name":"Hiroki Nishiyama","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8059894/7972937/nishi-2724642-small.gif","p":["Hiroki Nishiyama (S\u201905\u2013M\u201907\u2013SM\u201913) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in information science from Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, in 2007 and 2008, respectively.","He is an Associate Professor with the Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University.

Smart city applications focus on resolving issues facing people in everyday life, and have attracted a considerable amount of research interest. The typical issue encountered in such places of daily use, such as stations, shopping malls, and stadiums is crowd dynamics management. Therefore, we focus on crowd dynamics management to resolve the problem of congestion using IoT technologies. Real-time crowd dynamics management can be achieved by gathering information relating to congestion and propose less crowded places. Although many crowd dynamics management applications have been proposed in various scenarios and many models have been devised to this end, a general model for evaluating the control effectiveness of crowd dynamics management has not yet been developed in IoT research. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a model to evaluate the performance of crowd dynamics management applications. In other words, the objective of this paper is to present the proof-of-concept of control effectiveness of crowd dynamics management. Our model uses feedback control theory, and enables an integrated evaluation of the control effectiveness of crowd dynamics management methods under various scenarios. We also provide extensive numerical results to verify the effectiveness of the model.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2017.2724642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8059894","startPage":"1466","endPage":"1476","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8059894/07972937.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Feedback Control-Based Crowd Dynamics Management in IoT System","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6488907/8059894/7972937-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7972937/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7972937/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Feedback Control-Based Crowd Dynamics Management in IoT System","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17282010","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","issue":"5","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Strategic International Research Cooperative Program, Japan Science and Technology Agency"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CNS-1405747"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"A Feedback Control-Based Crowd Dynamics Management in IoT System","sourcePdf":"jiot-kawamoto-2724642-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129073S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8059894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"8059894","articleId":"7972937","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7972939,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Peng","affiliation":["College of Science, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"p":["Feng Peng received the B.Eng. degree in electronic science and\n technology, the M.Eng. degree in optical engineering, and the Ph.D. degree in photonics from Harbin Engineering\n University, Harbin, China, in 2007, 2009, and 2012, respectively.

A sample MTFC-based FODS was fabricated according to simulation parameters; the experimental results of strain distribution and sensitivity were determined by Brillouin optical time-domain analysis and vibrator, respectively, which in turn can be used to confirm the correctness of the prediction model. The tested strain distribution of MTFC has the same characteristic with its simulation model; the predicted sensitivity of MTFC-based FODS is 6448.0 rad/g. Three sample sensors are fabricated and tested, which have a fabrication error of 7%. All FODS simulations were carried out in the COMSOL Multiphysics environment, which has significant potential for application as a tool of predicting the FODS sensitivity when designing or fabrication an MTFC-based FODS.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensitivity Prediction of Multiturn Fiber Coil-Based Fiber-Optic Flexural Disk Seismometer via Finite Element Method Analysis","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2017.2724603","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8026348/07972939.pdf","startPage":"3870","endPage":"3876","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2017.2724603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8026348","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7972939","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7972939/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.15, 15 2017","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity Prediction of Multiturn Fiber Coil-Based Fiber-Optic Flexural Disk Seismometer via Finite Element Method Analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"18","htmlLink":"/document/7972939/","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2017","publicationDate":"15 Sept.15, 2017","accessionNumber":"17153883","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"61422505, 61635007, 61307104, 61405042, 61405044 and 61605031"},{"fundingName":"National Key Scientific Instrument and Equipment Development","grantNumber":"2013YQ040815"},{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFF0200704"},{"fundingName":"Harbin Science and Technology Innovative Talents","grantNumber":"2015RAYXJ009"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004602","fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"NCET-12-0623"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity Prediction of Multiturn Fiber Coil-Based Fiber-Optic Flexural Disk Seismometer via Finite Element Method Analysis","sourcePdf":"jlt-yang-2724603-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086929S","chronDate":"Sept.15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8026348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8026348","articleId":"7972939","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7972942,"authors":[{"name":"Ivan B.

The OAM modes, related to azimuthal dependence of the wavefront, are mutually orthogonal so that this additional degree of freedom can be utilized to improve both spectral efficiency and PLS in both optical and wireless networks. Spatial light modulators (SLMs) are routinely used to generate OAM modes in optical domain, in particular in FSO communications links. On the other hand, it has been recently demonstrated that a traveling-wave circular loop antenna, with azimuthal phase distribution along the loop, can be used to generate OAM in the RF domain. Reliability of FSO links is affected by atmospheric turbulence effects, scattering effects, and low-visibility in foggy conditions. On the other hand, RF technologies are not affected by these effects, but are sensitive to rain and snow. In particular, THz technologies, have available bandwidths comparable to a typical wavelength channel in WDM systems. Based on this complementarity, here we propose to use hybrid FSO-THz technologies to significantly improve the spectral efficiency and PLS of both FSO and wireless communications systems and networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/7953746/07972942.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2724563","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2724563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7953746","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7972942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OAM-Based Hybrid Free-Space Optical-Terahertz Multidimensional Coded Modulation and Physical-Layer Security","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber networks","Optical scattering","Optical sensors","Security","Radio frequency","Antenna arrays","Modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical-layer security","orbital angular momentum (OAM)","free-space optical (FSO) communication","hybrid FSO-terahertz technology","multidimensional coded modulation","atmospheric turbulence","multipath fading."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7972942/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"OAM-Based Hybrid Free-Space Optical-Terahertz Multidimensional Coded Modulation and Physical-Layer Security","volume":"9","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7972942/","impactStatement":"This paper is concerned with physical-layer security (PLS) and high spectral efficiency of hybrid free-space-optical (FSO)-THz communications.

In this paper a multitier fog computing model with large-scale data analytics service is proposed for smart cities applications. The multitier fog is consisted of ad-hoc fogs and dedicated fogs with opportunistic and dedicated computing resources, respectively. The proposed new fog computing model with clear functional modules is able to mitigate the potential problems of dedicated computing infrastructure and slow response in cloud computing. We run analytics benchmark experiments over fogs formed by Rapsberry Pi computers with a distributed computing engine to measure computing performance of various analytics tasks, and create easy-to-use workload models. Quality of services (QoS) aware admission control, offloading, and resource allocation schemes are designed to support data analytics services, and maximize analytics service utilities. Availability and cost models of networking and computing resources are taken into account in QoS scheme design. A scalable system level simulator is developed to evaluate the fog-based analytics service and the QoS management schemes. Experiment results demonstrate the efficiency of analytics services over multitier fogs and the effectiveness of the proposed QoS schemes. Fogs can largely improve the performance of smart city analytics services than cloud only model in terms of job blocking probability and service utility.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7972945/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","volume":"5","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"17685519","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7972945/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multitier Fog Computing With Large-Scale IoT Data Analytics for Smart Cities","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EU FP7 Project DETERMINE","grantNumber":"FP7-PEOPLE-2012-IRSES 318906"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multitier Fog Computing With Large-Scale IoT Data Analytics for Smart Cities","sourcePdf":"jiot-he-2724845-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.199816S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8334665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"8334665","articleId":"7972945","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7972946,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjie Yang","affiliation":["Wireless Networking and Mobile Communications Group, School of Electronic and Optical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7972946/yang-2724601-small.gif","p":["Wenjie Yang is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China.

Although cellular communication technologies are developed mainly for \u201chuman-type\u201dcommunications, enabling MTC with cellular networks not only improves the connectivity, accessibility, and availability of an MTC network but also has the potential to further drive down the operation cost. However, cellular MTC, especially when applied to low-power massive IoT (mIoT), poses some unique challenges due to the low-cost and low-power nature of an mIoT device. One of the most challenging issues is providing a robust way for an mIoT device to acquire the network under a large frequency offset due to the use of low-cost crystal oscillators and under extended coverage. Although differentiation is a well-known technique for removing impairments caused by frequency offset, its \u201cnoise amplification\u201deffect limits its applications in cellular communications due to the fact that cellular communication is typically interference limited. Matched-filter-based detection is, therefore, almost unexceptionally used. We show that the differential technique can actually benefit system acquisition in mIoT, where the use of low-cost crystals is a default. Although the existing system acquisition design in a cellular mIoT system, i.e., NB-IoT, facilitates both techniques, there still remain issues that need to be solved in order to take full advantage of the design. We provide a comprehensive analysis on the performance of two most common techniques when applied in a typical NB-IoT environment based on two factors, the geometry factor and the frequency offset factor. Finally, we derive the operating regions for matched-filter-based detection and differentiation using these two factors, in which the system acquisition performance of the two types of techniques is maximized for NB-IoT.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Crystals","Long Term Evolution","Time-frequency analysis","Frequency synchronization","OFDM","Performance

In particular, the named data networking (NDN) project (one of the ICN architecture flavors) offers features exploitable by IoT applications, such as stateful forwarding, in-network caching, and built-in assurance of data provenance. Though NDN-based IoT frameworks have been proposed, none have adequately and holistically addressed concerns related to secure onboarding and routing. Additionally, emerging IoT applications such as smart cities require high scalability and thus pose new challenges to NDN routing. Therefore, in this paper, we propose and evaluate a novel, scalable framework for lightweight authentication and hierarchical routing in the NDN IoT. Our ns-3 based simulation analyses demonstrate that our framework is scalable and efficient. It supports deployment densities as high as 40000 nodes/km\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n with an average onboarding convergence time of around 250 s and overhead of less than 20 kibibytes per node.

It is observed that the proposed inter-digital capacitor-based SRR and the meandered line-based SRR provide better sensitivity for dielectric and magnetic measurement, respectively, when compared with the standard SRR-based microwave sensors. Both the sensors are first modeled under unloaded condition, using the full wave electromagnetic solver, the CST Microwave Studio, in order to ensure their operating frequency range near 2.45 GHz of industrial, scientific and medical band. In the next step, the numerical simulation of these sensors is carried out by loading them with a number of reference materials in order to develop empirical model for the determination of permittivity and permeability of test samples. Additionally, the equivalent circuit models of these sensors are obtained using the Advanced Design System circuit simulator and results are compared with the numerical simulation. All the sensors are designed and fabricated on 1.27-mm-thick RT/Duroid 6006 substrate, and testing is carried out using the network analyzer. A number of standard dielectric and magneto-dielectric samples are tested using the proposed scheme in order to retrieve their permittivity and permeability values. The measured data of each sample are in good match with the corresponding reference values available in literature having a typical error of less than 6%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7972952/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.1, 1 2017","publicationDate":"1 Sept.1, 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7972952/","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2017","accessionNumber":"17099041","volume":"17","issue":"17","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Improved Planar Resonant RF Sensor for Retrieval of Permittivity and Permeability of Materials","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"DST","grantNumber":"DST/TSG/ME/2015/97"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Planar Resonant RF Sensor for Retrieval of Permittivity and Permeability of Materials","sourcePdf":"jsen-kt-2724942-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067735S","chronDate":"Sept.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"8006334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"8006334","articleId":"7972952","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":7972955,"authors":[{"name":"Mahyar Shirvanimoghaddam","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/8038094/7972955/shirv-2724442-small.gif","p":["Mahyar Shirvanimoghaddam (S\u201912\u2013M\u201915) received the B.Sc. degree (Hons.) from the University of Tehran, Iran, in 2008, the M.Sc. degree (Hons.) from the Sharif University of Technology, Iran, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree from The University of Sydney, Australia, in 2015, all in electrical engineering.

M2M solutions allow billions of multi-role devices to communicate with each other or with the underlying data transport infrastructure without, or with minimal, human intervention. Current solutions for wireless transmissions originally designed for human-based applications thus require a substantial shift to cope with the capacity issues in managing a huge amount of M2M devices. In this paper, we consider the multiple access techniques as promising solutions to support a large number of devices in cellular systems with limited radio resources. We focus on non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) where, with the aim to increase the channel efficiency, the devices share the same radio resources for their data transmission. This has been shown to provide optimal throughput from an information theoretic point of view. We consider a realistic system model and characterize the system performance in terms of throughput and energy efficiency in an NOMA scenario with a random packet arrival model, where we also derive the stability condition for the system to guarantee the performance.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2017.2724442","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/8038094/07972955.pdf","startPage":"2238","endPage":"2252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038094","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2017.2724442","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Fundamental Limits of Random Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access in Cellular Massive IoT","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7972955","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","displayDocTitle":"On the Fundamental Limits of Random Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access in Cellular Massive IoT","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7972955/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17171298","htmlLink":"/document/7972955/","volume":"35","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering (ATSE)","grantNumber":"PG 256404810"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Fundamental Limits of Random Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access in Cellular Massive IoT","sourcePdf":"jsac-shirvanimoghaddam-2724442-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168807S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"8038094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"8038094","articleId":"7972955","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7972957,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Yang","affiliation":["Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Intelligent Networks and Network Security, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/8038094/7972957/yang-2725107-small.gif","p":["Qian Yang (S\u201916) received the B.S. degree in information engineering from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2014, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in information and communication engineering.

We first propose a dynamic user scheduling and grouping strategy by leveraging limited feedback. Based on that, an analytical framework is proposed to obtain the outage probability of the network in closed form. The diversity order and the impacts of the number of feedback bits on the outage performance of NOMA are analyzed. Furthermore, the net throughput, which captures the network-wide throughput with the uplink feedback cost considered, is maximized by optimizing the number of feedback bits. Numerical results are demonstrated to verify our analytical findings and show that different from the perfect CSI case, there always exists a performance floor of outage probability in the considered network due to limited feedback. Moreover, the optimal number of feedback bits for net throughput maximization increases as the channel coherence time becomes longer.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2017.2725107","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/8038094/07972957.pdf","startPage":"2281","endPage":"2294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038094","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2017.2725107","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NOMA in Downlink SDMA With Limited Feedback: Performance Analysis and Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7972957","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","displayDocTitle":"NOMA in Downlink SDMA With Limited Feedback: Performance Analysis and Optimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7972957/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17171297","htmlLink":"/document/7972957/","volume":"35","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671364"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003181","fundingName":"Foundation for the Author of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of China","grantNumber":"201340"},{"fundingName":"Young Talent Support Fund of Science and Technology of Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2015KJXX-01"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council\u2019s Discovery Early Career Researcher Award funding scheme","grantNumber":"DE170100137"},{"fundingName":"NRF, South Korea","grantNumber":"MEST 2015R1A2A1A05000977"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NOMA in Downlink SDMA With Limited Feedback: Performance Analysis and Optimization","sourcePdf":"jsac-wang-2725107-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115668S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"8038094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"8038094","articleId":"7972957","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7972962,"authors":[{"name":"Songyun Wang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7972962/wang-2724598-small.gif","p":["Songyun Wang is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China.

Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is an effective technique for energy saving. Many previous works addressed energy-officiate task scheduling based on DVFS. However, these works need to know the total workload (execution time) of tasks, which is difficult for some real-time tasks requests. In this paper, we propose a new task model that describes the QoS requirements of tasks with the minimum frequency. In addition, we define energy consumption ratio (ECR) to evaluate the efficiency of different frequencies under which to execute a take. Thus, it is possible to convert the energy-efficient task scheduling problem into minimizing the total ECR. By transforming the problem to the variable size bin packing, we prove that the minimization of ECR is NP-hard in this paper. Because of the difficulty of this problem, we propose task allocation and scheduling methods based on the feature of this problem. The proposed methods dispatch the coming tasks to the active servers by using servers as less as possible and adjust the execution frequencies of relative cores to save energy. When a task is finished, we propose a processor-level migration algorithm to reschedule remaining tasks among processors on an individual server and dynamically balance the workloads and lower the total ECR on this server. The experiments in the real test-bed system and simulation show that our strategy outperforms other ones, which verifies the good performance of our strategy on energy saving.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A DVFS Based Energy-Efficient Tasks Scheduling in a Data Center","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2724598","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07972962.pdf","startPage":"13090","endPage":"13102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2724598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7972962","topic":"Emerging Trends, Issues, and Challenges in Energy-Efficient Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7972962/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","displayDocTitle":"A DVFS Based Energy-Efficient Tasks Scheduling in a Data Center","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7972962/","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17124558","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61472181"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002560","fundingName":"Soonchunhyang University Research Fund"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A DVFS Based Energy-Efficient Tasks Scheduling in a Data Center","sourcePdf":"access-you-2724598-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082955S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Emerging Trends, Issues, and Challenges in Energy-Efficient Cloud Computing"],"articleId":"7972962","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7972963,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Zhang","affiliation":["National Key Lab of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China","School of Electrical and Information Engineering, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/8038094/7972963/zhang-2724678-small.gif","p":["Lin Zhang (S\u201912) received the bachelor\u2019s degree in communication engineering from Sichuan University, Chengdu, China, in 2011.

Then, we analytically obtain the optimal power allocations with closed-form expressions at the BS and relay to minimize the outage probability. Furthermore, by taking the fairness between the near user and far user into account, we characterize the optimal power allocations with closed-form expressions at the BS and relay to maximize the minimum achievable rate of users.

However, traditional classification-based representation learning methods face the noisy and incomplete problem of the supervisory labels. In this paper, we propose a general knowledge base embedded image representation learning approach, which uses general knowledge graph, which is a multitype relational knowledge graph consisting of human commonsense beyond image space, as external semantic resource to capture the relations of concepts in image representation learning. A relational regularized regression CNN (R\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n CNN) model is designed to jointly optimize the image representation learning problem and knowledge graph embedding problem. In this manner, the learnt representation can capture not only labeled tags but also related concepts of images, which involves more precise and complete semantics. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to investigate the effectiveness and transferability of our approach in tag prediction task, zero-shot tag inference task, and content-based image retrieval task. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach performs significantly better than the existing representation learning methods. Finally, observation of the learnt relations show that our approach can somehow refine the knowledge base to describe images and label the images with structured tags.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7972969/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7972969/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17416552","volume":"20","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"General Knowledge Embedded Image Representation Learning","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Program on Key Basic Research Project","grantNumber":"2015CB352300"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1611461, 61521002, 61531006 and 61210008"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"General Knowledge Embedded Image Representation Learning","sourcePdf":"tmm-cui-2724843-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083392S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"8207707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8207707","articleId":"7972969","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7972975,"authors":[{"name":"Jianwen Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8062938/7972975/zhang-2723471-small.gif","p":["Jianwen Zhang received the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from the City University of Hong Kong in 2014.

In this model, assigning orthogonal training sequences to all users will incur a substantial overhead to the overall network, and is even impossible when the number of users is large. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce the notion of local orthogonality, under which the training sequence of a user is orthogonal to those of the other users in its neighborhood. We model the design of locally orthogonal training sequences as a graph coloring problem. Then, based on the theory of random geometric graph, we show that the minimum training length scales in the order of ln K, where K is the number of users covered by a CRAN. This implies that the proposed training design yields a scalable solution to sustain the need of largescale cooperation in CRANs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7972975/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7972975/","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17225684","volume":"16","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Locally Orthogonal Training Design for Cloud-RANs Based on Graph Coloring","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601289"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471241"},{"fundingName":"China Recruitment Program of Global Young Experts"},{"fundingName":"General Research Funding from the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong","grantNumber":"14209414 and 14200315"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Locally Orthogonal Training Design for Cloud-RANs Based on Graph Coloring","sourcePdf":"twc-yuan-2723471-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091829S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8062938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8062938","articleId":"7972975","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7972982,"authors":[{"name":"Jeroen C.

In formalizing the underlying consensus problem, a realistic vehicle dynamics model is considered and a velocity-dependent spacing policy between two consecutive vehicles is realized. As a particular case, the approach allows to consider bidirectional vehicle interaction, which improves the cohesion between vehicles in the platoon. Exponential stability of the platoon dynamics is evaluated, also in the challenging scenario in which a limitation on the velocity of one of the vehicles in the platoon is introduced. The theoretical results are experimentally validated using a three-vehicle platoon consisting of (longitudinally) automated vehicles equipped with wireless intervehicle communication and radar-based sensing.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2017.2720141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2017.2720141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8425800","startPage":"1592","endPage":"1605","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/87/8425800/07972982.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7972982","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicle dynamics","Topology","Laplace equations","Network topology","Control theory","Stability","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","distributed control","road traffic","road vehicles","vehicle dynamics","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["realistic vehicle dynamics model","velocity-dependent spacing policy","bidirectional vehicle interaction","exponential stability","automated vehicles","radar-based sensing","wireless intervehicle communication","vehicular platooning systems","distributed consensus control approach","velocity constraints"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Consensus","distributed control","intelligent transportation systems","vehicular platooning","velocity constraint"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Consensus Control for Vehicular Platooning With Velocity Constraints","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18006043","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7972982/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7972982/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consensus Control for Vehicular Platooning With Velocity Constraints","sourcePdf":"tcst-zegers-2720141-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089742S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"8425800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"8425800","articleId":"7972982","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":7972984,"authors":[{"name":"Shile Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Shile","lastName":"Li","id":"37085655910"},{"name":"Dongheui Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Dongheui","lastName":"Lee","id":"37068725100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-3766"},{"format":"CD","value":"2377-3774"}],"articleNumber":"7972984","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2074},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Cameras","Visualization","Dynamics","Simultaneous localization and mapping","Three-dimensional displays","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","iterative methods","robot vision","SLAM (robots)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic sequences","simultaneous localization and mapping system","IAICP method","intensity assisted iterative closest point","static environment","edge points","static weighting method","dynamic objects","depth edge points","frame-to-keyframe registration","visual odometry method","RGB-D SLAM system","real-time depth edge","static point weighting","dynamic environments"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer vision for other robotic applications","SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)","visual tracking"]}],"abstract":"We propose a real-time depth edge based RGB-D SLAM system for dynamic environment.

The EHPC can be equivalent to a parallel circuit of a negative resistance and an inductance, both of which can be adjusted. When a permanent single line-to-earth fault occurs, the ground-fault current will be compensated to almost zero, and the capacitance to earth and leakage resistance of system can be measured accurately for subsequent fault location. Then, the complex impedance of EHPC is adjusted, and the faulty feeder and its faulted section can be identified online based on the characteristics that the measurements of zero-sequence admittances of points along the faulty feeder change with the system's neutral-to-ground complex impedance. The detection criterion is certain and unique, without comparing all of the feeders. This paper also proposes an adaptive jitter adjustment and decoupling control of neutral-ground complex impedance by EHPC, which is adaptive to the grounding transient resistance and is repeatable, and can ensure that the magnitude of the zero-sequence parameter is large enough to be measured while without arc re-ignition, including in high impedance fault states. Simulations and experiments verified the feasibility of this fault location method and its control strategy.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2017.2716955","startPage":"689","endPage":"698","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel7/61/8322364/07972986.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2017.2716955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8322364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Location in Resonant Grounded Network by Adaptive Control of Neutral-to-Earth Complex Impedance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Impedance","Fault location","Resistance","Current measurement","Earth","Transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","coils","earthing","fault currents","fault location","power system control","power system faults"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["leakage resistance","EHPC","faulty feeder change","adaptive jitter adjustment","decoupling control","neutral-ground complex impedance","grounding transient resistance","adaptive control","neutral-to-earth complex impedance","resonant grounded system","neutral point grounds","electromagnetic hybrid Petersen coil","permanent single line-to-earth fault","ground-fault location method","ground-fault current compensation","zero-sequence admittance measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Arc suppression","faulty feeder detection","fault location","neutral-to-earth complex impedance","electromagnetic hybrid petersen coil (EHPC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7972986/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","displayDocTitle":"Fault Location in Resonant Grounded Network by Adaptive Control of Neutral-to-Earth Complex Impedance","volume":"33","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7972986/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2018","accessionNumber":"17634024","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Location in Resonant Grounded Network by Adaptive Control of Neutral-to-Earth Complex Impedance","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-cuihua-2716955-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072398S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"8322364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8322364","articleId":"7972986","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7972987,"authors":[{"name":"Akbar Assa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Akbar","lastName":"Assa","id":"37990927000"},{"name":"Konstantinos N.

In particular, the adjustment of measurement noise covariance is deemed paramount as it directly affects the estimation accuracy and plays the key role in applications such as sensor selection and sensor fusion. This letter proposes a novel adaptive scheme by approximating the measurement noise covariance distribution through finite samples, assuming the noise to be white with a normal distribution. Exploiting these samples in approximation of the system state a posteriori leads to a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), the components of which are acquired by Kalman filtering. The resultant GMM is then reduced to the closest normal distribution and also used to estimate the measurement noise covariance. Compared to previous adaptive techniques, the proposed method adapts faster to the unknown parameters and thus provides a higher performance in terms of estimation accuracy, which is confirmed by the simulation results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7972987/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7972987/","dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17027291","volume":"24","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Kalman Filtering by Covariance Sampling","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"PDF-487746-2016"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Kalman Filtering by Covariance Sampling","sourcePdf":"lsp-assa-2724848-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065872S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"7981445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7981445","articleId":"7972987","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7972988,"authors":[{"name":"Yuhui Zheng","affiliation":["Jiangsu Engineering Center of Network Monitoring, School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/8506638/7972988/zheng-2724940-small.gif","p":["Yuhui Zheng received the B.S. degree in chemistry and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2004 and 2009, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology.

However, the current existing SHMMs fail to take into consideration of the relevant features embedded in local subspaces, thus influencing their performances in clustering. To address the problem, a novel SHMM is proposed by combining the measure of localized feature saliency (LFS) with SMM and utilizing two student's t-distributions as subcomponents to respectively describe the distributions of useful features and non-salient \u201cfeatures,\u201d with the purpose of accurately modeling the hidden state observation emission distributions of SHMM.

The relay node splits its received signal into two components for energy harvesting and information decoding, respectively, and forwards the decoded information using a portion of the harvested energy. To maximize the end-to-end transmission rate, the power splitting factor and energy consumption proportion are jointly optimized for the relay with a single transmit antenna in the presence of self-interference. Furthermore, for the relay with multiple transmit antennas, a suboptimal relay beamformer is first designed and the power splitting factor and energy consumption proportion are then jointly optimized. Finally, the asymptotic transmission rate is analyzed with a large number of transmit antennas. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed schemes offer significant rate gain compared with some typical reference schemes, irrespective of the residual self-interference level. Especially, by employing a large number of source or relay transmit antennas, the wireless energy-powered relay system is capable of cutting its energy consumption significantly.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8062938/07972989.pdf","startPage":"6438","endPage":"6450","publicationTitle":"IEEE

The dispersion and dissolution of oil fractions into water result in its contamination with free oil and grease, aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes, known as BTEX), phenols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and highly soluble organic compounds (e.g., carboxyl acids. Many of these components are toxic, persistent, and bioaccumulative, posing a threat to ecosystems and human beings.

In this paper, non-orthogonal multiple access, which has been recently introduced as an effective scheme for fifth generation (5G) wireless networks, is considered in the context of VLC systems under different channel uncertainty models. To this end, we first derive a novel closed-form expression for the bit-error-rate (BER) under perfect channel state information (CSI). Capitalizing on this, we then quantify the effect of noisy and outdated CSI by deriving a simple and accurate approximation for the former and a tight upper bound for the latter. The offered results are corroborated by respective results from extensive Monte Carlo simulations and assist in developing useful insights on the effect of imperfect CSI knowledge on the overall system performance. Furthermore, it was shown that while noisy CSI leads to slight degradation in the BER performance, outdated CSI can cause considerable performance degradation, if the order of the users' channel gains change due to the involved mobility.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2722441","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8062938/07972998.pdf","startPage":"6350","endPage":"6364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8062938","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2722441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Performance of Visible Light Communication Systems With Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7972998","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","displayDocTitle":"On the Performance of Visible Light Communication Systems With Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7972998/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17225674","htmlLink":"/document/7972998/","volume":"16","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Performance of Visible Light Communication Systems With Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access","sourcePdf":"twc-karagiannidis-2722441-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092526S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8062938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"8062938","articleId":"7972998","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7973020,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687307/8061077/7973020/xu-2725277-small.gif","p":["Jie Xu received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2008 and 2010, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California at Los Angeles in 2015.

Providing grid power supply in support of mobile edge computing, however, is costly and even infeasible (in certain rugged or under-developed areas), thus mandating on-site renewable energy as a major or even sole power supply in increasingly many scenarios. Nonetheless, the high intermittency and unpredictability of renewable energy make it very challenging to deliver a high quality of service to users in energy harvesting mobile edge computing systems. In this paper, we address the challenge of incorporating renewables into mobile edge computing and propose an efficient reinforcement learning-based resource management algorithm, which learns on-the-fly the optimal policy of dynamic workload offloading (to the centralized cloud) and edge server provisioning to minimize the long-term system cost (including both service delay and operational cost). Our online learning algorithm uses a decomposition of the (offline) value iteration and (online) reinforcement learning, thus achieving a significant improvement of learning rate and run-time performance when compared to standard reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-learning. We prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm and analytically show that the learned policy has a simple monotone structure amenable to practical implementation. Our simulation results validate the efficacy of our algorithm, which significantly improves the edge computing performance compared to fixed or myopic optimization schemes and conventional reinforcement learning algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TCCN.2017.2725277","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687307/8061077/07973020.pdf","startPage":"361","endPage":"373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8061077","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCCN.2017.2725277","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Learning for Offloading and Autoscaling in Energy Harvesting Mobile Edge Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973020","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6687307/8061077/7973020-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Online Learning for Offloading and Autoscaling in Energy Harvesting Mobile Edge Computing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973020/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17281958","htmlLink":"/document/7973020/","volume":"3","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. NSF","grantNumber":"CNS-1551661, CNS-1565474 and ECCS-1610471"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Online Learning for Offloading and Autoscaling in Energy Harvesting Mobile Edge Computing","sourcePdf":"tccn-xu-2725277-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096465S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6687307","isNumber":"8061077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687307","citationCount":"142","xplore-issue":"8061077","articleId":"7973020","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7973029,"authors":[{"name":"Satya Krishna Joshi","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8062938/7973029/joshi-2722999-small.gif","p":["Satya Krishna Joshi (S\u201914) received the B.Eng. degree in electronics engineering from Tribhuvan University, Nepal, in 2003, and the M.Eng. degree in telecommunications from the Asian Institute of Technology, Pathum Thani, Thailand, in 2007.

We allow both operators to share (a fraction of) their licensed spectrum band with each other by forming a common spectrum band. The objective is to maximize the gain in profits of both operators by sharing their licensed spectrum bands rather than using them exclusively, while considering the fairness among the operators. This is modeled as a two-person bargaining problem, and cast as a stochastic optimization. To solve this problem, we propose centralized and distributed dynamic control algorithms. At each time slot, the proposed algorithms perform the following tasks: 1) determine spectrum price for the operators; 2) make flow control decisions of users data; and 3) jointly allocate spectrum band to the operators and design transmit beamformers, which is known as resource allocation (RA). Since the RA problem is NP-hard, we have to rely on sequential convex programming to approximate its solution. To derive the distributed algorithm, we use alternating direction method of multipliers for solving the RA problem. Numerically, we show that the proposed distributed algorithm achieves almost the same performance as the centralized one. Furthermore, the results show that there is a trade-off between the achieved profits of the operators and the network congestion.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8062938/07973029.pdf","startPage":"6365","endPage":"6381","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2722999","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2722999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8062938","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Inter-Operator Spectrum Sharing via Lyapunov Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Distributed algorithms","Wireless communication","Algorithm design and analysis","Optimization","Resource management","Games"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","optimisation","radio spectrum management","resource allocation","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic inter-operator spectrum sharing","Lyapunov optimization","dynamic network","licensed spectrum band","common spectrum band","two-person bargaining problem","stochastic optimization","centralized dynamic control","distributed dynamic control","flow control decisions","spectrum band allocation","resource allocation","NP-hard problem","sequential convex programming","multipliers alternating direction method","network congestion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Co-primary spectrum sharing","dynamic control","network utility maximization","stochastic optimization","Lyapunov drift","bargaining problem","fairness","sequential convex programming","alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)","distributed algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973029/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Inter-Operator Spectrum Sharing via Lyapunov Optimization","volume":"16","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7973029/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17225670","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003406","fundingName":"Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation (Tekes)"},{"fundingName":"Academy of Finland"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008500","fundingName":"Broadcom"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004356","fundingName":"Nokia"},{"fundingName":"Huawei"},{"fundingName":"Anite"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003038","fundingName":"Elektrobit"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004181","fundingName":"Nokia Foundation"},{"fundingName":"Tauno T\u00f6nning Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Inter-Operator Spectrum Sharing via Lyapunov Optimization","sourcePdf":"twc-joshi-2722999-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162456S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8062938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8062938","articleId":"7973029","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7973031,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Luo","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China","Chongqing Key Laboratory of Big Data and Intelligent Computing, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8167035/7973031/luo-2724769-small.gif","p":["Xin Luo (M\u201914\u2013SM\u201917) received the B.S. degree in\n computer science from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, and the Ph.D.\n degree in computer science from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2005 and 2011, respectively.","In 2016, he joined the Chongqing Institute of Green and Intelligent Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences,\n Chongqing, China, where he is currently a Professor of computer science and engineering.

They contain rich knowledge regarding various useful patterns. Nonnegative latent factor (NLF) models are effective and efficient in extracting useful knowledge from directed networks. However, they cannot describe the symmetry of an undirected network. For addressing this issue, this paper analyzes the extraction process of NLFs on asymmetric and symmetric matrices, respectively, thereby innovatively achieving the symmetric and nonnegative latent factor (SNLF) models for undirected, HiDS networks. The proposed SNLF models are equipped with: 1) high efficiency; 2) nonnegativity; and 3) symmetry. Experimental results on real networks show that the SNLF models are able to: 1) describe the symmetry of the target network rigorously; 2) ensure the nonnegativity of resultant latent factors; and 3) achieve high computational efficiency when addressing data analysis tasks like missing data estimation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973031/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17466359","htmlLink":"/document/7973031/","displayDocTitle":"Symmetric and Nonnegative Latent Factor Models for Undirected, High-Dimensional, and Sparse Networks in Industrial Applications","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Pioneer Hundred Talents Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"fundingName":"International Joint Project funded jointly by the Royal Society of the U.K."},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61611130209"},{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2017YFC0804002"},{"fundingName":"Young Scientist Foundation of Chongqing","grantNumber":"cstc2014kjrc-qnrc40005"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61370150, 61433014 and 61402198"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symmetric and Nonnegative Latent Factor Models for Undirected, High-Dimensional, and Sparse Networks in Industrial Applications","sourcePdf":"tii-luo-2724769-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087168S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8167035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"8167035","articleId":"7973031","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7973036,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyong Chen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Wireless-Optical Communications, Chinese Academy of Sciences, School of Information Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7990282/7973036/chen-2725223-small.gif","p":["Zhiyong Chen received the B.Eng. degree in electronic and information\n engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2012.

The work in the first category aims to develop analytical results for the comparison, often with fixed system parameters. The work in the second category aims to propose efficient algorithms for optimizing these parameters, and compares NOMA with OMA by computer simulations. However, when these parameters are optimized, the theoretical superiority of NOMA over OMA is still not clear. Therefore, in this paper, the theoretical performance comparison between NOMA and conventional OMA systems is investigated, from an optimization point of view. First, sum rate maximizing problems considering user fairness in both NOMA and various OMA systems are formulated. Then, by using the method of power splitting, a closed-form expression for the optimum sum rate of NOMA systems is derived. Moreover, the fact that NOMA can always outperform any conventional OMA systems, when both are equipped with the optimum resource allocation policies, is validated with rigorous mathematical proofs. Finally, computer simulations are conducted to validate the correctness of the analytical results.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2017.2725223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7990282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2017.2725223","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7990282/07973036.pdf","startPage":"5191","endPage":"5202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Optimization Perspective of the Superiority of NOMA Compared to Conventional OMA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"An Optimization Perspective of the Superiority of NOMA Compared to Conventional OMA","volume":"65","issue":"19","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.1, 1 2017","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7973036/","publicationDate":"1 Oct.1, 2017","accessionNumber":"17136287","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973036/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471334"},{"fundingName":"UK EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/L025272/1, H2020-MSCA-RISE-2015 and 690750"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Optimization Perspective of the Superiority of NOMA Compared to Conventional OMA","sourcePdf":"tsp-chen-2725223-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103046S","chronDate":"Oct.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7990282","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"7990282","articleId":"7973036","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7973038,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiwen Hu","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8062938/7973038/hu-2721938-small.gif","p":["Zhiwen Hu (S\u201915) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Peking University, China, in 2015, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

Since data dissemination plays an important part in ITS, recent studies have found caching as a promising way to promote the efficiency of data dissemination against rapid variation of network topology. In this paper, we focus on the scenario of roadside unit (RSU) caching, where multiple content providers (CPs) aim to improve the data dissemination of their own contents by utilizing the storages of RSUs. To deal with the competition among multiple CPs for limited caching facilities, we propose a multi-object auction-based solution, which is sub-optimal and efficient to be carried out. A caching-specific handoff decision mechanism is also adopted to take advantages of the overlap of RSUs. Simulation results show that our solution leads to a satisfactory outcome.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2721938","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8062938/07973038.pdf","startPage":"6321","endPage":"6334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2721938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8062938","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Roadside Unit Caching: Auction-Based Storage Allocation for Multiple Content Providers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973038","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973038/","displayDocTitle":"Roadside Unit Caching: Auction-Based Storage Allocation for Multiple Content Providers","volume":"16","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17225669","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7973038/","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National 973 Project","grantNumber":"2013CB336700"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1301255 and 61625101"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Roadside Unit Caching: Auction-Based Storage Allocation for Multiple Content Providers","sourcePdf":"twc-song-2721938-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142768S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8062938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8062938","articleId":"7973038","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7973039,"authors":[{"name":"Yingnan Pan","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/8491740/7973039/pan-2719629-small.gif","p":["Yingnan Pan received the B.S. degree in mathematics and applied mathematics and the M.S. degree in applied mathematics from Bohai University, Jinzhou, China, in 2012 and 2015, respectively.

In the system model, the parameter uncertainty is captured effectively by the membership functions (MFs) with upper and lower bounds. For reducing the utilization of limited communication bandwidth, an event-triggered communication mechanism is applied. A novel FD filter subject to event-triggered communication mechanism, data quantization, and communication delay is designed to generate a residual signal and detect system faults, where the premise variables are different from those of the system model. Consequently, the augmented FD system is with imperfectly matched MFs, which hampers the stability analysis and FD. To relax the stability analysis and achieve a better FD performance, the information of MFs and slack matrices are utilized in the stability analysis. Finally, two examples are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Event-Triggered Fault Detection Filter Design for Nonlinear Networked Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2017.2719629","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/8491740/07973039.pdf","startPage":"1851","endPage":"1862","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2017.2719629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8491740","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973039","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973039/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Event-Triggered Fault Detection Filter Design for Nonlinear Networked Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7973039/","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2018","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18164993","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Funds of National Science of China","grantNumber":"61420106016 and 61621004"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"N160406003"},{"fundingName":"Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries","grantNumber":"2013ZCX01-01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event-Triggered Fault Detection Filter Design for Nonlinear Networked Systems","sourcePdf":"tsmc-yang-2719629-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088438S","chronDate":"Nov.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"8491740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"8491740","articleId":"7973039","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7973040,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Xu Mao","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent, Canterbury, U.K."],"firstName":"Chun-Xu","lastName":"Mao","orcid":"0000-0002-4266-6826","id":"37085354916"},{"name":"Steven Gao","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent, Canterbury, U.K."],"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Gao","id":"37536096300"},{"name":"Yi Wang","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, University of Greenwich, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-8726-402X","id":"37085365667"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"7973040","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6061},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadband antennas","Bandwidth","Microstrip antenna arrays","Resonant frequency","Microstrip antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","broadband antennas","microstrip antenna arrays","millimetre wave antenna arrays","power dividers","resonator filters","slot antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband high-gain antenna array","beam-scanning antenna array","millimeter-wave applications","microstrip array antennas","antenna gain","U-slot resonator","feeding resonator","radiating patch","frequency selectivity","wideband power divider","loaded resonators","broadside radiation","scanned beam","frequency 22 GHz to 32 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadband","beam scanning","fifth generation (5G)","filtering","millimeter-wave (mm-wave)","antenna array","antenna"]}],"abstract":"A novel method of achieving low profile, broadband microstrip array antennas with high antenna gain is proposed for millimeter-wave applications. The element employs a novel third-order vertically coupled resonant structure that a U-slot resonator in the ground is used to couple with the feeding resonator and the radiating patch, simultaneously. This proposed structure can significantly improve the bandwidth and frequency selectivity without increasing the thickness of the antenna. Then, to achieve the subarray, a new wideband power divider with loaded resonators is employed, which can be used to further improve the bandwidth. To demonstrate the working schemes of broadside radiation and scanned beam, two 4 \u00d7 4 array antennas are implemented on the same board. Measured results agree well with the simulations, showing a wide bandwidth from 22 to 32 GHz (FBW = 37%) with the gain of around 19 dBi. The beam-scanning array can realize a scanning angle of 25\u00b0 over a broadband. In addition, due to the filtering features are integrated in the design, the proposed antenna could also reduce the complexity and potential cost of the frontends.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadband High-Gain Beam-Scanning Antenna Array for Millimeter-Wave Applications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2017.2724640","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/8024125/07973040.pdf","startPage":"4864","endPage":"4868","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2017.2724640","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8024125","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973040","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973040/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Broadband High-Gain Beam-Scanning Antenna Array for Millimeter-Wave Applications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7973040/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17155517","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"UK EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/N032497/1"},{"fundingName":"UK EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/M013529/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadband High-Gain Beam-Scanning Antenna Array for Millimeter-Wave Applications","sourcePdf":"tap-mao-2724640-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049716S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8024125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"8024125","articleId":"7973040","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7973041,"authors":[{"name":"Yingzhe Li","affiliation":["Wireless Networking and Communications Group, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8062938/7973041/li-2723468-small.gif","p":["Yingzhe Li received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2012, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA, in 2014 and 2017, respectively.

It consists of two main steps: cell search (CS) on the downlink and random access (RA) on the uplink. Millimeter wave (mm-wave) cellular systems typically must rely on directional beamforming (BF) in order to create a viable connection. The BF direction must, therefore, be learned-as well as used-in the initial access process for mm-wave cellular networks. This paper considers four simple but representative initial access protocols that use various combinations of directional BF and omnidirectional transmission and reception at the mobile and the BS, during the CS and RA phases. We provide a system-level analysis of the success probability for CS and RA for each one, as well as of the initial access delay and user-perceived downlink throughput (UPT). For a baseline exhaustive search protocol, we find the optimal BS beamwidth and observe that in terms of initial access delay it is decreasing as blockage becomes more severe, but is relatively constant (about \u03c0/12) for UPT. Of the considered protocols, the best tradeoff between initial access delay and UPT is achieved under a fast CS protocol.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2723468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2723468","startPage":"6409","endPage":"6425","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8062938/07973041.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8062938","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Analysis of Initial Access in Millimeter Wave Cellular Networks","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7693/8062938/7973041-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973041/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Design and Analysis of Initial Access in Millimeter Wave Cellular Networks","volume":"16","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17225685","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7973041/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"NSF-CCF-1218338"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000893","fundingName":"Award from the Simons Foundation","grantNumber":"197982"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Design and Analysis of Initial Access in Millimeter Wave Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-li-2723468-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138178S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8062938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"8062938","articleId":"7973041","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7973044,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Shen","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8248584/7973044/shen-2720629-small.gif","p":["Yi Shen received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in microelectronics from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2012 and 2015, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Microelectronics.

The ADC can be configured as an 80-MS/s 10-b, 40-MS/s 11-b, or 20-MS/s 12-b converter. Time-interleaved technique is applied to expand sampling bandwidth exponentially while resolution scales down. The channel mismatches are cancelled by the digital calibration technique. The bulk-biasing technique is used in the sampling switch to reduce the influence of the charge injection caused by the top-plate sampling. In addition, the configurable asynchronous processing is employed to extend the flexibility of speed and resolution tradeoff. Moreover, the two-step digital-to-analog converter (DAC) switching method is proposed to reduce the switching energy of the DAC. Prototyped in 180-nm CMOS process, the ADC achieves the 56.7-/61.2-/64.6-dB signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) and 72.3-/74.8-/75.5-dB spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) at 80-/40-/20-MHz sampling frequency with the power consumption of 2.61/2.05/1.77 mW.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973044/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","volume":"65","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"17520042","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2018","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7973044/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Reconfigurable 10-to-12-b 80-to-20-MS/s Bandwidth Scalable SAR ADC","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61625403, 61504104 and 61322405"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Reconfigurable 10-to-12-b 80-to-20-MS/s Bandwidth Scalable SAR ADC","sourcePdf":"tcsi-zhu-2720629-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083772S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8248584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8248584","articleId":"7973044","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7973047,"authors":[{"name":"Sriram Ganapathy","affiliation":["Learning and Extraction of Acoustic Patterns Labs, Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India"],"firstName":"Sriram","lastName":"Ganapathy","id":"37637655200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"7973047","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":500},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Speech","Spectrogram","Discrete cosine transforms","Noise measurement","Estimation","Speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive processes","discrete cosine transforms","feature extraction","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic speech recognition system","ASR system","autoregressive modeling approach","robust feature extraction","spectrotemporal domain","speech feature extraction","joint time-frequency processing","multivariate AR modeling","MAR","subband discrete cosine transform","Riesz temporal envelopes","multicondition training","clean training","REVERB challenge database","reverberant artifacts"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feature extraction","multivariate autoregressive (MAR) models","Riesz envelopes","speech recognition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LSP.2017.2724561","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2017.2724561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7981445","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/7981445/07973047.pdf","startPage":"1373","endPage":"1377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multivariate Autoregressive Spectrogram Modeling for Noisy Speech Recognition","abstract":"The performance of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system is highly degraded in the presence of noise and reverberation. The autoregressive (AR) modeling approach, which preserves the high energy regions of the signal that are less susceptible to noise, first, presents a potential method for robust feature extraction. Second, there are strong correlations in the spectrotemporal domain of the speech signal, which are generally absent in noise. In this letter, we propose a novel method for speech feature extraction, which combines the advantages of AR approach and joint time-frequency processing using the multivariate AR modeling (MAR). Specifically, the subband discrete cosine transform coefficients obtained from multiple speech bands are used in the MAR framework to derive the Riesz temporal envelopes that provide features for ASR. We perform several speech recognition experiments in the Aurora-4 database with clean and multicondition training. In these experiments, the proposed features provide significant improvements over other noise robust feature extraction methods (relative improvements of 24% in clean training and 14% in multicondition training over mel features). Furthermore, the speech recognition experiments in REVERB challenge database illustrates the extension of the MAR modeling method for suppressing reverberant artifacts.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973047/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","volume":"24","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17131976","htmlLink":"/document/7973047/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multivariate Autoregressive Spectrogram Modeling for Noisy Speech Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multivariate Autoregressive Spectrogram Modeling for Noisy Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"lsp-ganapathy-2724561-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083234S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"7981445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7981445","articleId":"7973047","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7973048,"authors":[{"name":"Takumi Ishihara","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takumi","lastName":"Ishihara","id":"37085857458"},{"name":"Shinya Sugiura","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinya","lastName":"Sugiura","orcid":"0000-0001-7736-8696","id":"37667603100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"7973048","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1347},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973048","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-domain analysis","Receivers","Complexity theory","OFDM","Modulation","Euclidean distance","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","error statistics","frequency-domain analysis","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","phase shift keying","radio transceivers","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-domain FTN symbols","activated symbols","sparse FTN-IM signaling","FTN-specific inter-symbol interference","higher spectral efficiency","conventional FTN counterpart","low-complexity noise-whitening frequency-domain equalization","FTN-IM receiver","index modulation","faster-than-Nyquist transmission scheme","time-domain single-carrier index-modulation concept","amplitude phase shift keying","faster-than-Nyquist signaling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Faster-than-Nyquist signaling","frequency-domain equalization","index modulation","minimum Euclidean distance","colored noise","minimum-mean square error"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we propose a novel faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) transmission scheme relying on the time-domain single-carrier index-modulation (IM) concept.

Classical target coverage methods often assume that the environment is perfectly known, and each target is covered by only one sensor. Such algorithms, however, are inflexible, especially if a sensor died, i.e., ran out of energy, and hence, a target may need to be covered by more than one sensor, which is known as the K-coverage problem. The K-coverage problem is a time and energy consuming process, and the organization between sensors is required all the time. To address this problem, this article proposes a K-coverage model based on genetic algorithm to extend a WSN lifetime. In the search for the optimum active cover, different factors such as targets' positions, the expected consumed energy, and coverage range of each sensor are taken into account. A set of experiments were conducted using different K-coverage cases. Compared to some state-of-the-art methods, the proposed model improved the WSN's performance regarding to the amount of the consumed energy, the network lifetime, and the required time to switch between different covers.","doi":"10.1109/LSENS.2017.2724846","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7782634/7949374/07973054.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Letters","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSENS.2017.2724846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7949374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"K-Coverage Model Based on Genetic Algorithm to Extend WSN Lifetime","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Wireless sensor networks","Mathematical model","Genetic algorithms","Base stations","Monitoring","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["K-coverage model","genetic algorithm","WSN lifetime","wireless sensor networks","K-coverage problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sensor networks","K-coverage","wirless sensor network (WSN) lifetime","target monitoring","genetic algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973054/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","displayDocTitle":"K-Coverage Model Based on Genetic Algorithm to Extend WSN Lifetime","volume":"1","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7973054/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2017","accessionNumber":"17130409","externalId":"7500404","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"K-Coverage Model Based on Genetic Algorithm to Extend WSN Lifetime","sourcePdf":"lsens-elhoseny-2724846-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143632S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7782634","isNumber":"7949374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7782634","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7949374","articleId":"7973054","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7973055,"authors":[{"name":"Kenza Hamidouche","affiliation":["CentraleSup\u00e9lec, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France","Wireless@VT, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8007359/7973055/hamid-2702559-small.gif","p":["Kenza Hamidouche received the Engineering Diploma degree in computer science from the Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure d\u2019Informatique, Algiers, in 2012, the Research Master\u2019s degree in computer science from the Scholarship Program at the University of Rennes 1, and the Ph.D. degree from Centrale-Sup\u00e9lec in 2016, for her thesis on resource allocation for 5G networks.

Such mechanisms must account for the heterogeneity of the backhaul that will encompass both wireless backhaul links (at various frequency bands) and a wired backhaul component. In this paper, the heterogeneous backhaul management problem is formulated as a minority game in which each SBS has to define the number of predicted files to download, without affecting the required transmission rate of the current requests. For the formulated game, it is shown that a unique fair proper mixed Nash equilibrium (PMNE) exists. A self-organizing reinforcement learning algorithm is then proposed and shown to converge to a unique Boltzmann-Gibbs equilibrium, which approximates the desired PMNE. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed approach can be close to that of the ideal optimal algorithm while it outperforms a centralized greedy approach in terms of the amount of data that is cached without jeopardizing the quality-of-service of current requests.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7693/8007359/7973055-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973055/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","volume":"16","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7973055/","accessionNumber":"17099477","displayDocTitle":"The 5G Cellular Backhaul Management Dilemma: To Cache or to Serve","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ERC Starting","grantNumber":"305123 MORE"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1460316, CNS-1513697 and CNS-1617896"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"The 5G Cellular Backhaul Management Dilemma: To Cache or to Serve","sourcePdf":"twc-hamidouche-2702559-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131582S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8007359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8007359","articleId":"7973055","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7973057,"authors":[{"name":"Aqeel A.

The methodology involves fabricating precise cavities in acrylic templates and filling them with composite dielectric materials to create a monolithic polymer-based DRA (PRA) array layer. The excitation feed lines are fabricated on a separate substrate layer and the two layers are aligned and bonded together to form the PRA antenna array module. The impact of the acrylic frame on the PRA performance is analyzed through simulations. A four-element array operating at 60 GHz is realized to demonstrate the approach.

The reconstruction method for a real network is concerned with finding the optimal values of the model parameters by utilizing the powerlaw exponents of model network and the real network. The method is validated for certain real world networks. The usefulness of NRM in order to solve structural reconstruction problem is demonstrated by comparing its performance with some existing popular network generative models. We show that NRM can generate networks which follow edge-densification and densification power-law when the model parameters satisfy an inequality. Computable expressions of the expected number of triangles and expected diameter are obtained for model networks generated by NRM. Finally, we numerically establish that NRM can generate networks with shrinking diameter and modular structure when specific model parameters are chosen.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2017.2725264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8031002","startPage":"2072","endPage":"2085","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/69/8031002/07973077.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Parametric Model Approach for Structural Reconstruction of Scale-Free Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 1 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7973077/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Parametric Model Approach for Structural Reconstruction of Scale-Free Networks","publicationDate":"1 Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17204252","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"29","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Parametric Model Approach for Structural Reconstruction of Scale-Free Networks","sourcePdf":"tkde-pandey-2725264-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145572S","chronDate":"Oct. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"8031002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8031002","articleId":"7973077","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7973089,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Hu","affiliation":["Tianjin Key Laboratory of Imaging and Sensing Microelectronic Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/8006334/7973089/hu-2724064-small.gif","p":["Kai Hu received the B.E. degree in electronic science and technology and the M.S. degree in microelectronics and solid-state electronics from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 2008 and 2012, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in microelectronics and solid-state electronics.

Different from conventional detector, the TnGaAs self-mixing detector presents a low impedance and a complex electrical model. The linear chirp local-oscillator (LO) electrical signal through the detector causes a large dc current and a unique dc offset voltage (Vos) error in the ROTC. To overcome these problems, the blocking capacitors and the novel multiple low-pass filters are applied in the ROTC. The ROTC array was fabricated in 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS process. The measured results show that the Vos error is eliminated within the limited LO amplitude range and the ROTC achieves a 140-dB\u03a9 transimpedance gain with a bandwidth of 1 MHz. Compared with the state-of-the-art FM/cw LADAR, the ROTC accurately detects the signal of interest of the TnGaAs FPA self-mixing detectors and miniaturizes the LADAR receiver.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2017.2724064","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/8006334/07973089.pdf","startPage":"5547","endPage":"5557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2017.2724064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8006334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a CMOS ROIC for InGaAs Self-Mixing Detectors Used in FM/cw LADAR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973089","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.1, 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973089/","displayDocTitle":"Design of a CMOS ROIC for InGaAs Self-Mixing Detectors Used in FM/cw LADAR","volume":"17","issue":"17","publicationDate":"1 Sept.1, 2017","accessionNumber":"17099027","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7973089/","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004872","fundingName":"State Oceanic Administration of China","grantNumber":"CaiJianHan [2014] No. 58"},{"fundingName":"National High Tech.

The graph construction which reflects relationships among raw data points is crucial to the quality of resulting low-dimensional representations. To improve the quality of graph and make it more suitable for feature extraction tasks, we incorporate a new graph learning mechanism into feature extraction and add an interaction between the learned graph and the low-dimensional representations. Based on this learning mechanism, we propose a novel framework, termed as unsupervised single view feature extraction with structured graph (FESG), which learns both a transformation matrix and an ideal structured graph containing the clustering information. Moreover, we propose a novel way to extend FESG framework for multi-view learning tasks. The extension is named as unsupervised multiple views feature extraction with structured graph (MFESG), which learns an optimal weight for each view automatically without requiring an additional parameter. To show the effectiveness of the framework, we design two concrete formulations within FESG and MFESG, together with two efficient solving algorithms. Promising experimental results on plenty of real-world datasets have validated the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973090/","volume":"29","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7973090/","accessionNumber":"17204253","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised Single and Multiple Views Feature Extraction with Structured Graph","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61473302 and 61503396"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised Single and Multiple Views Feature Extraction with Structured Graph","sourcePdf":"tkde-hou-2725263-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150129S","chronDate":"Oct. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"8031002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8031002","articleId":"7973090","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7973096,"authors":[{"name":"Christian A.

However, existing power allocation schemes have not considered the delay quality of service (QoS) requirement in the datalink layer of users, and hence may not ensure the desired delay QoS requested by the services in the upper layers. Different from existing works, we apply the statistical QoS theory into NOMA systems and formulate the physical-datalink cross-layer power allocation problem as a stochastic optimization problem under different delay QoS constraints. Also, we show that the formulated problem is quasi-concave and propose a bisection-based cross-layer power allocation algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is able to converge to the optimal solution obtained by exhaustive search. Also, the proposed scheme outperforms existing fixed NOMA and time-division multiple access based schemes in terms of max-min effective capacity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer Power Allocation in Nonorthogonal Multiple Access Systems for Statistical QoS Provisioning","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2725641","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8207705/07973098.pdf","startPage":"11388","endPage":"11393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2725641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8207705","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973098","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973098/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Power Allocation in Nonorthogonal Multiple Access Systems for Statistical QoS Provisioning","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7973098/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416509","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61601377 and 61571373"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2682016CX043"},{"fundingName":"Key International Cooperation Project of Sichuan Province","grantNumber":"2017HH0002"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC China\u2013Swedish","grantNumber":"6161101297"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Power Allocation in Nonorthogonal Multiple Access Systems for Statistical QoS Provisioning","sourcePdf":"tvt-liu-2725641-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087329S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8207705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8207705","articleId":"7973098","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7973137,"authors":[{"name":"Yuxuan Ke","affiliation":["Institute of Acoustics, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","Chinese Academy of Sciences, Acoustics and Information Technology Laboratory, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7973137/ke-2725450-small.gif","p":["Yuxuan Ke received the B.S. degree in electronic and information engineering from Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China, in 2014.

Several parameter-free robust adaptive beamformers (RAB) are considered in this paper. We reveal that the performances of them have somewhat degradation when the number of snapshots or that of sensors is large. To solve this problem, we emphatically study the well-known generalized linear combination-based method, the performance of which may degrade severely when the number of sensors increases, and propose a novel parameter-free technique, which is a combination of noise reduction preprocessing technique and truncated minimum mean square error criterion. As most of the parameter-free RAB techniques are very sensitive to the desired signal steering vector mismatch, this paper further proposes to construct a series connection between these RAB techniques and a steering vector estimation (SVE) method, where the SVE is implemented by a convex optimization technique. Simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve a promising performance in comparison with the competing methods.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2725450","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07973137.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2725450","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","startPage":"12974","endPage":"12987","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Adaptive Beamforming Using Noise Reduction Preprocessing-Based Fully Automatic Diagonal Loading and Steering Vector Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973137","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Robust Adaptive Beamforming Using Noise Reduction Preprocessing-Based Fully Automatic Diagonal Loading and Steering Vector Estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973137/","volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7973137/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17124559","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Fund of China","grantNumber":"61571435 and 61302126"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Robust Adaptive Beamforming Using Noise Reduction Preprocessing-Based Fully Automatic Diagonal Loading and Steering Vector Estimation","sourcePdf":"access-zheng-2725450-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1356S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7973137","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7973138,"authors":[{"name":"Li Ping Qian","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/8038094/7973138/qian-2725178-small.gif","p":["Li Ping Qian (S\u201908\u2013M\u201910\u2013SM\u201916) received the Ph.D. degree in information engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2010.

Since the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with successive interference cancellation (SIC) can achieve superior spectral and energy efficiency, massive connectivity and low transmission latency, we introduce the NOMA with SIC to V2S networks in this paper. Due to the fast vehicle mobility and varying communication environment, it is important to dynamically allocate small-cell base stations and transmit power to vehicular users with considering the vehicle mobility in NOMA-enabled V2S networks. To this end, we present the joint optimization of cell association and power control that maximizes the long-term system-wide utility to enhance the long-term system-wide performance and reduce the handover rate. To solve this optimization problem, we first equivalently transform it into a weighted sum rate maximization problem in each time frame based on the standard gradient-scheduling framework. Then, we propose the hierarchical power control algorithm to maximize the equivalent weighted sum rate in each time frame based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions and the idea of successive convex approximation. Finally, theoretical analysis and simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution satisfying KKT optimality conditions.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2017.2725178","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/8038094/07973138.pdf","startPage":"2342","endPage":"2356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2017.2725178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038094","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Cell Association for Non-Orthogonal Multiple-Access V2S Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973138","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973138/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Cell Association for Non-Orthogonal Multiple-Access V2S Networks","volume":"35","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17171291","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7973138/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61379122, 61572440 and 91638204"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"LR16F010003, LR17F010002 and LQ15F010003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Cell Association for Non-Orthogonal Multiple-Access V2S Networks","sourcePdf":"jsac-wu-2725178-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104773S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"8038094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"8038094","articleId":"7973138","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7973144,"authors":[{"name":"Simin Peng","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Yancheng Institute of Technology, Yancheng, China","Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering, University of Maryland at College Park, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7973144/peng-2725301-small.gif","p":["Simin Peng (M\u201916) received the B.S degree in automation from Xiangtan University, Xiangtan, China, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2013.

To resolve this problem, a method based on adaptive UKF (AUKF) with a noise statistics estimator is proposed to estimate accurately SOC of BESSs. The noise statistics estimator based on the modified Sage-Husa maximum posterior is aimed to estimate adaptively the mean and error covariance of measurement and system process noises online for the AUKF when the prior noise statistics are unknown or inaccurate. The accuracy and adaptation of the proposed method is validated by the comparison with the UKF and EKF under different real-time conditions. The comparison shows that the proposed method can achieve better SOC estimation accuracy when the noise statistics of BESSs are unknown or inaccurate.","topic":"Battery Energy Storage and Management Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973144/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","volume":"5","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"17124561","publicationDate":"2017","htmlLink":"/document/7973144/","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"State of Charge Estimation of Battery Energy Storage Systems Based on Adaptive Unscented Kalman Filter With a Noise Statistics Estimator","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51507150"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China","grantNumber":"BK20150430"},{"fundingName":"Project of Natural Science Foundation of Higher Education Institutions of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"15KJB480004"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Project of State Grid of China","grantNumber":"J2017128"},{"fundingName":"Qing Lan Project of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"2016-15"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"State of Charge Estimation of Battery Energy Storage Systems Based on Adaptive Unscented Kalman Filter With a Noise Statistics Estimator","sourcePdf":"access-peng-2725301-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10257S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Battery Energy Storage and Management Systems"],"articleId":"7973144","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7973146,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiguo Ding","affiliation":["School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University, Lancaster, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/8038094/7973146/ding-2725519-small.gif","p":["Zhiguo Ding (S\u201903\u2013M\u201905\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2000, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Imperial College London in 2005.

However, because of the early stage of the Elman neural network to train the connection weights between the layers, the training effect is difficult to guarante with the connection weights. So the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is adopted to optimize the Elman neural network, to avoid it falling into the local optimum. At the same time, to solve the problem that the position of the search agent is randomly distributed in the initialization process of the WOA algorithm, and to introduce the idea of chaos, a chaos WOA (CWOA) based on the idea of chaos is proposed to improve the diversity of all search agents and egocentricity of agent search by utilizing the chaotic features. At the end of this paper, considering that the input vector dimension is too large, the neural network topology is very large, which will lead to the complexity of the training process. Therefore, the locally linear embedding method is introduced to reduce the dimension of high-dimensional input vectors. The simulation results show that the chaotic whale algorithm can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of economic and technical indexes of PVC polymerization process, which especially has a significant improvement in the prediction effect in the early stage and meets the requirements of real-time control of the production process of the polymerization reactor.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2723610","startPage":"13062","endPage":"13076","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2723610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07973148.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elman Neural Network Soft-Sensor Model of Conversion Velocity in Polymerization Process Optimized by Chaos Whale Optimization Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973148/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Elman Neural Network Soft-Sensor Model of Conversion Velocity in Polymerization Process Optimized by Chaos Whale Optimization Algorithm","volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7973148/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"17124562","publicationDate":"2017","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Project by National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"21576127"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004767","fundingName":"Program for Research Special Foundation of the University of Science and Technology of Liaoning","grantNumber":"2015TD04"},{"fundingName":"Opening Project of National Financial Security and System Equipment Engineering Research Center","grantNumber":"USTLKFGJ201502"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Elman Neural Network Soft-Sensor Model of Conversion Velocity in Polymerization Process Optimized by Chaos Whale Optimization Algorithm","sourcePdf":"access-wang-2723610-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061628S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7973148","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7973151,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Zhou","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Nanodevices and Applications, Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Suzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245494/8015129/7973151/zhou-2725320-small.gif","p":["Yu Zhou received the Ph.D. degree in microelectronics and solid state electronics from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2013.

The skeleton of these applications is formed by a network of distributed sensors that captures data, pre-processes, and transmits it to a center for further processing. While these sensors are generally perceived to be a wireless network of sensing devices that are deployed permanently as part of an application, the emerging mobile crowd-sensing (MCS) concept prescribes a drastically different platform for sensing; a network of smartphones, owned by a volunteer crowd, can capture, pre-process, and transmit the data to the same center. We call these two forms of sensors dedicated and non-dedicated sensors in this paper. While dedicated sensors imply higher deployment and maintenance costs, the MCS concept also has known implementation challenges, such as incentivizing the crowd and ensuring the trustworthiness of the captured data, and covering a wide sensing area. Due to the pros/cons of each option, the decision as to which one is better becomes a non-trivial answer. In this paper, we conduct a thorough study of both types of sensors and draw conclusions about which one becomes a favourable option based on a given application platform.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7361/8103835/7973152-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973152/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1, 1 2017","volume":"17","issue":"23","accessionNumber":"17340015","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2017","publicationDate":"1 Dec.1, 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7973152/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Large-Scale Distributed Dedicated- and Non-Dedicated Smart City Sensing Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000144","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1239423 and CNS-1647135"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"RGPIN/2017-04032"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Large-Scale Distributed Dedicated- and Non-Dedicated Smart City Sensing Systems","sourcePdf":"jsen-kantarci-2725638-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.227036S","chronDate":"Dec.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"8103835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8103835","articleId":"7973152","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7973154,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Dong","affiliation":["McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada","Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/8225762/7973154/dong-2724619-small.gif","p":["Zheng Dong received the B.Sc. and M.Eng. degrees from the School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China, in 2009 and 2012, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada, in 2016.

Unlike most existing designs using (continuous) Gaussian input distribution, we consider the practical finite-alphabet (i.e., discrete) inputs by assuming that the widely used quadrature amplitude modulation constellations are adopted by both transmitters. To balance the error performance of two receivers, we apply the max-min fairness design criterion in this paper. More specifically, we propose to jointly optimize the scaling factors at both transmitters, which control the minimum Euclidean distance of transmitting constellations, to maximize the smaller minimum Euclidean distance of two resulting constellations at the receivers, subject to an individual average power constraint at each transmitter. The formulated problem is a mixed continuous-discrete optimization problem and is thus intractable in general. By resorting to the Farey sequence, we manage to attain the closed-form expression for the optimal solution to the formulated problem. This is achieved by dividing the overall feasible region of the original optimization problem into a finite number of sub-intervals and deriving the optimal solution in each sub-interval. Through carefully observing the structure of the optimal solutions in all sub-intervals, we obtain compact and closed-form expressions for the optimal solutions to the original problem in three possible scenarios defined by the relative strength of the cross link. Simulation studies are provided to validate our analysis and demonstrate the merits of the proposed design over existing orthogonal or non-orthogonal schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access With Finite-Alphabet Inputs in Z-Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2017.2724619","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/8225762/07973154.pdf","startPage":"2829","endPage":"2845","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2017.2724619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8225762","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973154","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973154/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"On Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access With Finite-Alphabet Inputs in Z-Channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7973154/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17431657","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1501253, 61501485 and 61601304"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2015A030311030"},{"fundingName":"Foundation of Shenzhen City","grantNumber":"ZDSYS201507081625213"},{"fundingName":"Foundation of Nanshan District Shenzhen City","grantNumber":"KC2015ZDYF0023A"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"FL160100032 and DP150104019"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access With Finite-Alphabet Inputs in Z-Channels","sourcePdf":"jsac-huang-2724619-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.173554S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"8225762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8225762","articleId":"7973154","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7973155,"authors":[{"name":"Yiming Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/8038094/7973155/liu-2724680-small.gif","p":["Yiming Liu received the B.E. degree in communication from Shanghai University, China, in 2014.

On the one hand, network densification provides opportunities to cooperate among a large number of access points (APs) for serving a given user. On the other hand, the limited radio resources cause the serious competition among numerous APs and may degrade the network performance. Therefore, to support large number of connections and break through the restriction of limited frequency resource, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), which supports multiple signals to transmit on the same frequency resource, is introduced into the UUDN. However, NOMA with network densification arises a series of challenges. And the method to group APs efficiently on the same frequency to support for a given user is a critical problem. Thus, in this paper, we propose a user-centric access framework for providing efficient access service and the flexible resource management in NOMA-based UUDN. Under the proposed framework, we then investigate the access scheme that organizes multiple APs into respective AP group (APG) cooperatively to provide access service for each user, aiming at maximizing the system energy efficiency. First, considering the users' requirement and network environment, a grouping evaluation model is set up to organize APG efficiently. Then, we formulate the resource allocation problem of APG as a mix-integer non-linear programming problem, which is hard to tackle. For tractability purpose, we transform this problem and propose low-complexity algorithms based on matching and differ of convex programming theories to obtain a feasible solution. Extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate the significant performance improvement compared with the existing schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/8038094/07973155.pdf","startPage":"2295","endPage":"2311","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2017.2724680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2017.2724680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038094","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grouping and Cooperating Among Access Points in User-Centric Ultra-Dense Networks With Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NOMA","Resource management","Interference","Wireless communication","5G mobile communication","Throughput","Programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","convex programming","energy conservation","integer programming","multi-access systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access points","user-centric ultra-dense networks","non-orthogonal multiple access","fifth-generation systems","network densification","radio resources","user-centric access framework","energy efficiency","resource allocation","mix-integer non-linear programming","convex programming theories"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["User-centric ultra-dense network (UUDN)","non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)","access management","cooperative resource allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973155/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Grouping and Cooperating Among Access Points in User-Centric Ultra-Dense Networks With Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access","volume":"35","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7973155/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17171294","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671088"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project","grantNumber":"2016ZX03001017"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grouping and Cooperating Among Access Points in User-Centric Ultra-Dense Networks With Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access","sourcePdf":"jsac-li-2724680-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.215488S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"8038094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"8038094","articleId":"7973155","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7973156,"authors":[{"name":"Ki Jun Jeon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, 50 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8110747/7973156/jeon-2725276-small.gif","p":["Ki Jun Jeon (S\u201914) received the B.S. degree (Hons.) in electrical engineering from Kyunghee University in 2008, and the M.S.E. degree in electrical engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2010, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department.

The key feature of the proposed ARACA code is represented by the outer connection doping in the protograph. This feature can provide the linear minimum distance growth (LMDG) property at a good iterative decoding threshold while maintaining an efficient encoder structure. The effect of the outer connection doping on the typical minimum distance, the iterative decoding threshold, and the LMDG property is discussed and analyzed by comparing case examples and using the asymptotic protograph ensemble weight enumerator.

Airborne ultrasound may be used as an alternative to RF for indoor wireless communication systems for securely transmitting data over short ranges, as signals are difficult to intercept from outside the room. Two types of air-coupled capacitive ultrasonic transducer were used in the implementation of an indoor airborne wireless communication system. One was a commercially available SensComp series 600 ultrasonic transducer with a nominal frequency of 50 kHz, and the other was a prototype transducer with a high-k dielectric layer operating at higher frequencies from 200 to 400 kHz. Binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)-based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing modulation methods were successfully implemented using multiple orthogonal subchannels. The modulated ultrasonic signal packets were synchronized using a wireless link, and a least-squares channel estimation algorithm was used to compensate the phase and amplitude distortion introduced by the air channel. By sending and receiving the ultrasonic signals using the SensComp transducers, the achieved maximum system data rate was up to 180 kb/s using 16-QAM with ultrasonic channels from 55 to 99 kHz, over a lineof-sight transmission distance of 6 m with no detectable errors. The transmission range could be extended to 9 and 11 m using QPSK and BPSK modulation schemes, respectively. The achieved data rates for the QPSK and BPSK schemes were 90 and 45 kb/s using the same bandwidth. For the high-k ultrasonic transducers, a maximum data rate up to 800 kb/s with no measurable errors was achieved up to a range of 0.7 m. The attainable transmission ranges were increased to 1.1 and 1.2 m with data rates of 400 and 200 kb/s using QPSK and BPSK, respectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/58/8017665/07973160.pdf","startPage":"1345","endPage":"1353","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2017.2725583","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2017.2725583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8017665","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Indoor Airborne Ultrasonic Wireless Communication Using OFDM Methods","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Acoustics","Radio frequency","Channel estimation","Wireless communication","Binary phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitive transducers","channel estimation","distortion","indoor radio","least squares approximations","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","quadrature phase shift keying","radio links","security of data","ultrasonic transducers","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor airborne ultrasonic wireless communication","OFDM methods","radiofrequency wireless transmissions","RF wireless transmissions","data security issues","remote signal interception techniques","indoor wireless communication system","air-coupled capacitive ultrasonic transducer","SensComp series 600 ultrasonic transducer","high-k dielectric layer","binary phase shift keying","quadrature phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation-based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing modulation method","QAM-based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing modulation methods","multiple orthogonal subchannels","wireless link","least-squares channel estimation algorithm","phase distortion compensation","amplitude distortion compensation","line-of-sight transmission distance","QPSK modulation scheme","BPSK modulation scheme","frequency 200 kHz to 400 kHz","frequency 55 kHz to 99 kHz","bit rate 90 kbit/s","bit rate 45 kbit/s","bit rate 400 kbit/s","bit rate 200 kbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Air-coupled ultrasound","capacitive ultrasonic transducers","channel estimation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","ultrasonic communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973160/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Indoor Airborne Ultrasonic Wireless Communication Using OFDM Methods","volume":"64","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7973160/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17138521","pubMedId":"28708551","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001602","fundingName":"Science Foundation Ireland Research Frontiers Program","grantNumber":"11/RFP.1/ECE3119"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001636","fundingName":"National Access Plan Award 225 from the Tyndall National Institute, University College Cork"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Indoor Airborne Ultrasonic Wireless Communication Using OFDM Methods","sourcePdf":"tuffc-jiang-2725583-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103782S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"8017665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8017665","articleId":"7973160","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7973162,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Zaimbashi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, Kerman, Iran"],"bio":{"p":["Amir Zaimbashi received the B.Sc. degree in electronics from Shahid Bahonar University, Kerman, Iran, in 2004, the M.Sc. degree in communication systems from Yazd University, Yazd, Iran, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in communication systems from Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran, in 2013.

Based on this standpoint, all discovered works on a target-detection problem in an ATV-based PBR have focused on the Doppler information in echoes of the television video carrier signal not range information. To cope with the severe range ambiguity of the ATV signal and make it possible to jointly estimate targets' delays and Doppler shifts, we propose a new detector performing target detection in a layered manner. In each layer, one target is detected. Detection in each layer is done using a generalized likelihood ratio detector. Interference due to the detected target in the first layer is estimated and subtracted from the received signal. From the first layer's interference canceled signal, another target (if exist) is detected in the second layer. The interference due to the second layer's detected target is estimated and subtracted. These detection and interference cancellation steps are carried out in each layer, until all the targets are detected. The proposed detector is also implemented based on the chirp z-transform to efficiently obtain targets' Doppler shifts over a limited range of Doppler frequencies. To obtain an effective cancellation of the strong interfering targets as well as off-grid targets, a robust version of resulting algorithm is also presented. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the high performance of the resulting target-detection algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973162/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.1, 1 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"17","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Sept.1, 2017","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2017","accessionNumber":"17099028","htmlLink":"/document/7973162/","displayDocTitle":"Target Detection in Analog Terrestrial TV-Based Passive Radar Sensor: Joint Delay-Doppler Estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Target Detection in Analog Terrestrial TV-Based Passive Radar Sensor: Joint Delay-Doppler Estimation","sourcePdf":"jsen-zaimbashi-2725822-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075059S","chronDate":"Sept.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"8006334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8006334","articleId":"7973162","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7973164,"authors":[{"name":"Yaoqing Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Yaoqing Yang (S\u201914) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering in 2013 from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.

Focusing first on arbitrary network topologies, we provide: 1) fundamental limits on the required number of broadcasts of data gathering and 2) a general in-network computing strategy to achieve an upper bound within factor log N of the fundamental limits, where N is the number of agents in the network. Next, focusing on two example networks, namely, arbitrary geometric networks and random Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi networks, we provide improved in-network computing schemes that are optimal in that they attain the fundamental limits, i.e., the lower and upper bounds are tight in scaling sense. Our main techniques are three distributed encoding techniques, called graph codes, which are designed, respectively, for the above-mentioned three scenarios. Our work, thus, extends and unifies previous works such as those of Gallager and Karamchandani on the number of broadcasts for distributed function computation in special network topologies, while bringing in novel techniques, e.g., from error-control coding and noisy circuits, for both upper and lower bounds.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2017.2725267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8011574","startPage":"6059","endPage":"6084","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/8011574/07973164.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graph Codes for Distributed Instant Message Collection in an Arbitrary Noisy Broadcast Network","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/18/8011574/7973164-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973164/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7973164/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Graph Codes for Distributed Instant Message Collection in an Arbitrary Noisy Broadcast Network","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17135643","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"63","issue":"9","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007245","fundingName":"Systems on Nanoscale Information fabriCs, one of the six SRC STARnet Centers, sponsored by MARCO and DARPA"},{"fundingName":"Bertucci Graduate Fellowship"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"ECCS-1306128 and CCF-1513916"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"ECCS-1343324, CCF-1350314 (NSF CAREER) and CNS-1702694"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Graph Codes for Distributed Instant Message Collection in an Arbitrary Noisy Broadcast Network","sourcePdf":"tit-kar-2725267-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.163613S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"8011574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8011574","articleId":"7973164","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7973165,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/8024125/7973165/fyang-2725379-small.gif","p":["Feng Yang was born in Chongqing, China, in 1991.

In this paper, an effective joint optimization approach based on the combination of convex programming (CP) and differential evolution (DE) algorithm is proposed. By designing suitable time sequences of a 4-D heterogeneous array with uniform static amplitude excitations, the original synthesis problem is simplified into two independent small problems, which can be easily solved in two steps, respectively. In the first step, the approach takes definite advantages from the convexity of the problem with respect to the static phase excitations and the switch-on duration times. These optimization variables become known and are fixed in the second step. Then, the DE algorithm is used to optimize the switch-on time instants. Owing to the efficiency of the CP, only 2/3 of the optimization variables need be solved in the first step, while even fewer number of optimization variables are solved in the second step. Consequently, the joint optimization of CP and DE algorithm significantly improves the overall synthesis efficiency. Two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2017.2725379","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/8024125/07973165.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8024125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2017.2725379","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"4585","endPage":"4594","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Joint Optimization Approach for the Synthesis of Large 4-D Heterogeneous Antenna Arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973165","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Joint Optimization Approach for the Synthesis of Large 4-D Heterogeneous Antenna Arrays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973165/","volume":"65","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7973165/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17155499","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61631006 and 61571101"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Joint Optimization Approach for the Synthesis of Large 4-D Heterogeneous Antenna Arrays","sourcePdf":"tap-yang-2725379-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105802S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8024125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8024125","articleId":"7973165","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7973171,"authors":[{"name":"Marcus Karlsson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/8017695/7973171/karls-2725823-small.gif","p":["Marcus Karlsson received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Link\u00f6ping University in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Division of Communication Systems, Department of Electrical Engineering.

Unlike current state-of-the-art approaches in CNN-based hyperspectral image classification, the proposed network, called contextual deep CNN, can optimally explore local contextual interactions by jointly exploiting local spatio-spectral relationships of neighboring individual pixel vectors. The joint exploitation of the spatio-spectral information is achieved by a multi-scale convolutional filter bank used as an initial component of the proposed CNN pipeline. The initial spatial and spectral feature maps obtained from the multi-scale filter bank are then combined together to form a joint spatio-spectral feature map. The joint feature map representing rich spectral and spatial properties of the hyperspectral image is then fed through a fully convolutional network that eventually predicts the corresponding label of each pixel vector. The proposed approach is tested on three benchmark data sets: the Indian Pines data set, the Salinas data set, and the University of Pavia data set. Performance comparison shows enhanced classification performance of the proposed approach over the current state-of-the-art on the three data sets.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2017.2725580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7983498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2017.2725580","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7983498/07973178.pdf","startPage":"4843","endPage":"4855","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Going Deeper With Contextual CNN for Hyperspectral Image Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Going Deeper With Contextual CNN for Hyperspectral Image Classification","volume":"26","issue":"10","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7973178/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17040669","pubMedId":"28708555","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973178/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Going Deeper With Contextual CNN for Hyperspectral Image Classification","sourcePdf":"tip-lee-2725580-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151243S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7983498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"7983498","articleId":"7973178","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7973179,"authors":[{"name":"Weikai Xu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8068314/7973179/xu-2725261-small.gif","p":["Weikai Xu (S\u201910\u2013M\u201912) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Three Gorges College, Chongqing, China, in 2000, the M.Sc. degree in communication engineering from the Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in electronics engineering from the Xiamen University of China, Xiamen, China, in 2011.","From 2003 to 2012, he was a Teaching Assistant and is currently an Assistant Professor of communication engineering with Xiamen University.

However, its data rate is limited by the available Walsh codes in the Walsh code matrix due to orthogonality constraint of GCS-DCSK signal. In this paper, we propose a new GCS-DCSK scheme with code index modulation (CIM-CS-DCSK), which can achieve higher spectrum efficiency using code index modulation to carry additional bits. In the proposed scheme, the reference chaotic signal is the same as that of GCS-DCSK, and the multiple information bearing signals are simultaneously modulated by the information symbols and the selected Walsh codes with specific indices, which are determined by an integer sequence mapped from information symbols via the natural numbers to k-combinations mapping method. We derive bit error rate of the proposed scheme over the additive white Gaussian noise channel. The numerical results not only verify our analysis but also show the advantage of the proposed scheme over GCS-DCSK. Through analyzing and comparing the numbers of carried bits per transmitted symbol of CIM-CS-DCSK and GCS-DCSK, it is shown that the proposed scheme can obtain higher data rate than GCS-DCSK with the same resource constraints.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2725261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2725261","startPage":"4285","endPage":"4294","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8068314/07973179.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8068314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code-Shifted Differential Chaos Shift Keying With Code Index Modulation for High Data Rate Transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973179/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Code-Shifted Differential Chaos Shift Keying With Code Index Modulation for High Data Rate Transmission","volume":"65","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17243577","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7973179/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF of China","grantNumber":"61271241"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code-Shifted Differential Chaos Shift Keying With Code Index Modulation for High Data Rate Transmission","sourcePdf":"tcomm-xu-2725261-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100034S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8068314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"8068314","articleId":"7973179","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7973181,"authors":[{"name":"Jari-Matti Hannula","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Nanoengineering, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/8024125/7973181/hannu-2725384-small.gif","p":["Jari-Matti Hannula (S\u201916) was born in Luvia, Finland, in 1990.

In caching networks, coded caching is a recently proposed technique that achieves significant performance gains over the uncoded caching schemes. However, to implement the coded caching schemes, each file has to be split into F packets, which usually increases exponentially with the number of users K. Thus, designing caching schemes that decrease the order of F is meaningful for practical implementations. In this paper, by reviewing the Ali-Niesen caching scheme, the placement delivery array (PDA) design problem is first formulated to characterize the placement issue and the delivery issue with a single array. Moreover, we show that, through designing appropriate PDA, new centralized coded caching schemes can be discovered. Second, it is shown that the Ali-Niesen scheme corresponds to a special class of PDA, which realizes the best coding gain with the least F. Third, we present a new construction of PDA for the centralized coded caching system, wherein the cache size M at each user (identical cache size is assumed at all users) and the number of files N satisfies M/N = 1/q or (q - 1)/q (q is an integer, such that q \u2265 2).

For M service antennas, the expected correlation between a pair of channel vectors under line-of-sight (LoS) conditions decreases at least as fast as log(M)/M, while in independent and identically distributed (iid) Rayleigh fading, it decreases much slower at 1/\u221aM, but the variance is higher under LoS. This signifies that typically channel vectors are more nearly orthogonal under LoS, but with a non-negligible probability, they can have an anomalously large correlation. A single-cell analysis discloses that Massive MIMO with max-min power control performs comparably under LoS and iid Rayleigh, when a simple algorithm is applied under LoS to drop a small number of high-correlation users from service.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973186/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","volume":"65","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"17372568","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7973186/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Massive MIMO With Max-Min Power Control in Line-of-Sight Propagation Environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Massive MIMO With Max-Min Power Control in Line-of-Sight Propagation Environment","sourcePdf":"tcomm-yang-2725262-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160391S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8110747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"8110747","articleId":"7973186","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7973187,"authors":[{"name":"Heeseok Oh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/7983498/7973187/oh-2725584-small.gif","p":["Heeseok Oh received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and electronics engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2010, 2012, and 2017, respectively.

Furthermore, compared with full-reference (FR) S3D IQA metrics, it is difficult to achieve competitive quality score predictions using the extracted features, which are not optimized with respect to human opinion. To cope with this limitation of the conventional approach, we introduce a novel deep learning scheme for NR S3D IQA in terms of local to global feature aggregation. A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model is trained in a supervised manner through two-step regression. First, to overcome the lack of training data, local patch-based CNNs are modeled, and the FR S3D IQA metric is used to approximate a reference ground-truth for training the CNNs. The automatically extracted local abstractions are aggregated into global features by inserting an aggregation layer in the deep structure. The locally trained model parameters are then updated iteratively using supervised global labeling, i.e., subjective mean opinion score (MOS). In particular, the proposed deep NR S3D image quality evaluator does not estimate the depth from a pair of S3D images. The S3D image quality scores predicted by the proposed method represent a significant improvement over those of previous NR S3D IQA algorithms. Indeed, the accuracy of the proposed method is competitive with FR S3D IQA metrics, having ~ 91% correlation in terms of MOS.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2017.2725584","startPage":"4923","endPage":"4936","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2017.2725584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7983498","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7983498/07973187.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Deep S3D Image Quality Evaluation via Local to Global Feature Aggregation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973187/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Blind Deep S3D Image Quality Evaluation via Local to Global Feature Aggregation","volume":"26","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7973187/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17132023","pubMedId":"28708557","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea through the Korean Government (MSIP)","grantNumber":"2016R1A2B2014525"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Deep S3D Image Quality Evaluation via Local to Global Feature Aggregation","sourcePdf":"tip-lee-2725584-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140051S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7983498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7983498","articleId":"7973187","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":7973352,"authors":[{"name":"T.

However, the development of Smart City solutions is faced with challenges since there is no clear definition for Smart Cities yet. This paper provides a review on what challenges arise when designing Smart City solutions to provide a complete overview of identified challenges.

This is mainly due to the complexity of the topic and the lack of tools that visualize the inner workings of PLDs and enable students to modify and inspect individual components. The majority of publicly available SPLD-related tools are proprietary, platform-specific and do not expose all elements of the PLD structure to the user. In this work, we propose a learning tool that enables synthesis, visualization and editing the programming of a GAL16v8 SPLD. GAL16v8 has been chosen as it is simple enough that its physical implementation can be observed to the smallest detail, while enabling simultaneous realization of multiple Boolean functions. The tool is platform-independent and specifically tailored towards use in an educational setting, facilitating much better understanding of SPLDs through a hands-on experience.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7973374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/MIPRO.2017.7973381","publicationTitle":"2017 40th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 40th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7958418/7973374/07973381.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"12","doi":"10.23919/MIPRO.2017.7973381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A learning tool for synthesis, visualization, and editing of programming for simple programmable logic devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"A learning tool for synthesis, visualization, and editing of programming for simple programmable logic devices","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-26 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7973381/","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17027426","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973381/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A learning tool for synthesis, visualization, and editing of programming for simple programmable logic devices","confLoc":"Opatija, Croatia","sourcePdf":"0007-0012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063946S","chronDate":"22-26 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7958418","isNumber":"7973374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7958418","xplore-issue":"7973374","articleId":"7973381","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Croatian Society MIPRO","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7973400,"authors":[{"name":"Leon \u0160neler","affiliation":["Department of Communications, Computer Science and Information Technology, Osijek, Croatia"],"firstName":"Leon","lastName":"\u0160neler","id":"37085773436"},{"name":"Marijan Herceg","affiliation":["Department of Communications, Computer Science and Information Technology, Osijek, Croatia"],"firstName":"Marijan","lastName":"Herceg","id":"38261156800"},{"name":"Tomislav Mati\u0107","affiliation":["Department of Communications, Computer Science and Information Technology, Osijek, Croatia"],"firstName":"Tomislav","lastName":"Mati\u0107","id":"37085774128"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-953-233-090-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-953-233-092-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4969-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7973400","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":180},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse generation","Wireless communication","Wireless sensor networks","Sensors","Computer architecture","Ultra wideband technology","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulse frequency modulation","pulse generators","pulsed power technology","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrawideband pulse generator","time-encoding wireless transmission","time-encoded pulse train","direct pulsed triggering","time encoding machine","pulse generator circuit","pulse power spectral density","size 0.24 mum","energy 189 pJ","time 301 ns","voltage 502 mV"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ultra-Wideband","pulse generator","Time-Encoding Machine","Integral Pulse Frequency Modulator","Power Spectral Density"]}],"abstract":"The paper presents implementation of the Ultra-Wideband (UWB) pulse generator suitable for wireless transmission of time-encoded pulse train.

This paper discusses possible types of sectionalized windings of a VIT with primary and secondary interleave, which result in lower leakage inductances. On the basis of a detailed finite element method (FEM) analysis, a prototype VIT is designed and produced. The ratio error and the phase angle error are measured on the prototype using a digital calibrator, digital multimeter (DMM) and a phase-angle meter. As well, the performance of the transformer over the wider frequency bandwidth and under the harmonically rich excitation is experimentally investigated.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 40th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7958418/7973374/07973411.pdf","startPage":"166","endPage":"170","publicationTitle":"2017 40th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)","doi":"10.23919/MIPRO.2017.7973411","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/MIPRO.2017.7973411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7973374","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FEM analysis and design of a voltage instrument transformer for digital sampling wattmeter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inductance","Windings","Finite element analysis","Voltage measurement","Transformer cores","Measurement uncertainty","Phase measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital multimeters","finite element analysis","inductance","instrument transformers","magnetic leakage","potential transformers","transformer windings","voltage dividers","wattmeters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voltage instrument transformer","VIT","digital sampling wattmeter","voltage divider","National Instruments PXI 4461","dynamic signal analyzer","acquisition card","galvanic isolation","sectionalized windings","leakage inductance","finite element method","frequency bandwidth","phase-angle meter","DMM","digital multimeter","digital calibrator","phase angle error","FEM analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973411/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"FEM analysis and design of a voltage instrument transformer for digital sampling wattmeter","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7973411/","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17027402","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","conferenceDate":"22-26 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FEM analysis and design of a voltage instrument transformer for digital sampling wattmeter","confLoc":"Opatija, Croatia","sourcePdf":"0166-0170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058433S","chronDate":"22-26 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7958418","isNumber":"7973374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7958418","xplore-issue":"7973374","articleId":"7973411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Croatian Society MIPRO","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7973418,"authors":[{"name":"F.

However, network load balancing can be critical for an ordered sequence of VNFs, also known as Service Function Chains (SFCs), a common cloud and network service approach today. The placement of these chained functions increases the ping-pong traffic between VNFs, directly affecting to the efficiency of bandwidth utilization. The optimization of the placement of these VNFs is a challenge as also other factors need to be considered, such as the resource utilization. To address this issue, we study the problem of VNF placement with replications, and especially the potential of VNFs replications to help load balance the network, while the server utilization is minimized. In this paper we present a Linear Programming (LP) model for the optimum placement of functions finding a trade-off between the minimization of two objectives: the link utilization and CPU resource usage. The results show how the model load balance the utilization of all links in the network using minimum resources.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973481/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17027335","htmlLink":"/document/7973481/","conferenceDate":"22-26 May 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Replication of Virtual Network Functions: Optimizing link utilization and resource costs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Replication of Virtual Network Functions: Optimizing link utilization and resource costs","confLoc":"Opatija, Croatia","sourcePdf":"0521-0526.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067254S","chronDate":"22-26 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7958418","isNumber":"7973374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7958418","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7973374","articleId":"7973481","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Croatian Society MIPRO","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7973486,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this paper, a simulation model to study various M-ary QAM modulation techniques is proposed. The simulation model is implemented in Matlab/Simulink environment and BERTool in conjunction with the model is also used. Simulation for 64-QAM and 256-QAM modulation techniques is done. The effect of the phase noise on the constellation diagram for both M-QAMs is examined. The impact of changing the power of the input signal, phase noise and frequency offset on Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of 64-QAM and 256-QAM is also studied. The simulation results in terms of the constellation diagram and the BER curve under various conditions are presented and analyzed.","doi":"10.23919/MIPRO.2017.7973486","publicationTitle":"2017 40th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 40th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7958418/7973374/07973486.pdf","startPage":"547","endPage":"554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/MIPRO.2017.7973486","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7973374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation study of M-ARY QAM modulation techniques using Matlab/Simulink","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973486","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 May 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973486/","displayDocTitle":"Simulation study of M-ARY QAM modulation techniques using Matlab/Simulink","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17027370","htmlLink":"/document/7973486/","conferenceDate":"22-26 May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation study of M-ARY QAM modulation techniques using Matlab/Simulink","confLoc":"Opatija, Croatia","sourcePdf":"0547-0554.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0638S","chronDate":"22-26 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7958418","isNumber":"7973374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7958418","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7973374","articleId":"7973486","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Croatian Society MIPRO","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7973543,"authors":[{"name":"Dragan Cvetkovic","affiliation":["Faculty of Education in Sombor, University of Novi Sad, Serbia"],"firstName":"Dragan","lastName":"Cvetkovic","id":"38110578200"},{"name":"Marko Mijatovic","affiliation":["Faculty of informatics, Intemational University of Brcko"],"firstName":"Marko","lastName":"Mijatovic","id":"37086007891"},{"name":"Marijan Mijatovic","affiliation":["Faculty of informatics, Intemational University of Brcko"],"firstName":"Marijan","lastName":"Mijatovic","id":"37086007890"},{"name":"Branko Medic","affiliation":["Technical College of Applied Sciences, Subotica, Serbia"],"firstName":"Branko","lastName":"Medic","id":"37086013342"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-953-233-090-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-953-233-092-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4969-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7973543","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":268},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Education","Databases","Virtual machining","Computer languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","distance learning","teaching","virtual machines","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual machines","teaching resources","cloud computing technologies","distance learning","Web service model"]}],"abstract":"The improvement of communication and the exchange of teaching resources between teachers and students has developed a model of web services based on cloud computing technology.

RCPSP belongs to the class of NP hard problems. Integer Programming (IP) is one of the exact solving methods that can be used for solving RCPSP. IP formulation uses binary decision variables for generating a feasible solution and with different boundaries eliminates some of solutions to reduce the solution space size. All exact methods, including IP, search through entire solution space so they are impractical for very large problem instances. Due to the fact that exact methods are not applicable to all problem instances, many heuristic approaches are developed, such as genetic algorithms. In this paper we compare the time complexity of IP formulations and genetic algorithms when solving the RCPSP. We present two different solution representations for genetic algorithms, permutation vector and vector of floating point numbers. Two formulations of IP and and their time and convergence results are compared for the aforementioned approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 May 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973603/","accessionNumber":"17027558","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7973603/","publicationDate":"May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","conferenceDate":"22-26 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Complexity comparison of integer programming and genetic algorithms for resource constrained scheduling problems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complexity comparison of integer programming and genetic algorithms for resource constrained scheduling problems","confLoc":"Opatija, Croatia","sourcePdf":"1182-1188.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103325S","chronDate":"22-26 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7958418","isNumber":"7973374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7958418","xplore-issue":"7973374","articleId":"7973603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Croatian Society MIPRO","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7973604,"authors":[{"name":"Kadri Sylejmani","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, University of Prishtina, Prishtina, Kosovo"],"firstName":"Kadri","lastName":"Sylejmani","id":"38547371700"},{"name":"Arbnor Halili","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, University of Prishtina, Prishtina, Kosovo"],"firstName":"Arbnor","lastName":"Halili","id":"37085795207"},{"name":"Arbnor Rexhepi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, University of Prishtina, Prishtina, Kosovo"],"firstName":"Arbnor","lastName":"Rexhepi","id":"37086106581"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-953-233-090-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-953-233-092-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4969-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7973604","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973604","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Sociology","Statistics","Mathematical model","Search problems","Space exploration","Economics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["educational courses","educational institutions","further education","genetic algorithms","mathematical operators","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["academic programs","learning material","mutation-only genetic algorithm","academic curricula balancing","master degree","bachelor degree","mutation operators","search space","course credits","academic curricula optimization","intelligent method"]}],"doi":"10.23919/MIPRO.2017.7973604","pdfPath":"/iel7/7958418/7973374/07973604.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 40th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 40th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)","startPage":"1189","endPage":"1194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7973374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/MIPRO.2017.7973604","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Balancing academic curricula by using a mutation-only genetic algorithm","abstract":"In universities, the academic programs are organized in a number of periods, usually in six or ten semesters, for a bachelor or a master degree, respectively. It usually happens that a given semester is much loaded with courses than the others. This makes it hard for the students to comprehend and deal with a high volume of learning material per certain semesters. This problem is difficult, because some courses have prerequisites (e.g. Math2 should be taught after Math1), and this means that course correlation mast be taken into account. Therefore, in this paper, we present an intelligent method that is based on genetic algorithms to optimize the academic curricula of a given program, by trying to dispatch the courses over the available semesters, so that the load of individual semesters, in terms of course credits, is balanced as much as possible. The proposed genetic algorithm explores the search space by means of two mutation operators, which swap or shift courses between the semesters. The algorithm performance is fine-tuned and evaluated by using three state of art instances from the literature. The results show that the proposed algorithm is comparable with the state of the art solutions for the problem at hand.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 May 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973604/","accessionNumber":"17027538","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7973604/","publicationDate":"May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","conferenceDate":"22-26 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Balancing academic curricula by using a mutation-only genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Balancing academic curricula by using a mutation-only genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Opatija, Croatia","sourcePdf":"1189-1194.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085847S","chronDate":"22-26 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7958418","isNumber":"7973374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7958418","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7973374","articleId":"7973604","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Croatian Society MIPRO","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7973605,"authors":[{"name":"Haris Hasic","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"],"firstName":"Haris","lastName":"Hasic","id":"37086191845"},{"name":"Emir Buza","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"],"firstName":"Emir","lastName":"Buza","id":"37086039522"},{"name":"Amila Akagic","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"],"firstName":"Amila","lastName":"Akagic","id":"38491071100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-953-233-090-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-953-233-092-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4969-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7973605","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proteins","Amino acids","Windows","Machine learning algorithms","Biological neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","neural nets","pattern classification","pattern clustering","proteins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protein secondary structure prediction","artificial neural networks","amino acid sequence","alpha helices","beta strands","classification-based methods","clusterization-based methods","quaternary predictions","tertiary predictions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bioinformatics","Protein Secondary Structure Prediction","Hybrid Method","Neural Networks","Machine Learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973605","abstract":"The prediction of protein secondary structure is the method of finding the way in which an amino acid sequence causes the protein structure to fold and bend into alpha helices, beta strands and other shapes. Until today, the problem of finding protein secondary structure is not fully resolved. Classification or clusterization based methods have an accuracy rate of circa 80 percent and they mainly work on a reduced set of shapes and folds. It is very difficult to predict how a local sequence of amino acids is going to behave and in which way it is going to affect the future of protein structure. Based upon the predicted secondary structure of the protein, the tertiary and quaternary predictions show the real nature and function of the protein as a whole.

It has long history in control applications, in simulated or in real-time implementations. MATLAB/Simulink is used for rapid building of CMAC neural network controller prototypes than can run in real-time. To run the controller in the same personal computer, QuaRC is used as real-time operating system that will execute controller task along Windows operating system. Hardware-in-the-loop architecture was used to test CMAC controller in real ball-and-beam physical plant from Quanser. Library of developed Simulink functional blocks enable easy exploration of different structural aspects of CMAC neural network controller, including selection of receptive field types, receptive field widths, Albus overlays, and fully interconnected multi-dimensional receptive fields. Same CMAC controller can be used also for controlling model of the plant, which can serve as means for controller to acquire knowledge before operating with real plant. CMAC controller learned to control the plant, and progressively became main control signal generator, while control signal from primary proportional-derivative controller almost vanished. Developed library can serve as easy startup for working with CMAC networks also for other types of applications.","doi":"10.23919/MIPRO.2017.7973606","pdfPath":"/iel7/7958418/7973374/07973606.pdf","startPage":"1201","endPage":"1206","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 40th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)","publicationTitle":"2017 40th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/MIPRO.2017.7973606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7973374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware-in-the-loop architecture with MATLAB/Simulink and QuaRC for rapid prototyping of CMAC neural network controller for ball-and-beam plant","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973606/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Hardware-in-the-loop architecture with MATLAB/Simulink and QuaRC for rapid prototyping of CMAC neural network controller for ball-and-beam plant","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17027374","publicationDate":"May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7973606/","conferenceDate":"22-26 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware-in-the-loop architecture with MATLAB/Simulink and QuaRC for rapid prototyping of CMAC neural network controller for ball-and-beam plant","confLoc":"Opatija, Croatia","sourcePdf":"1201-1206.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068545S","chronDate":"22-26 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7958418","isNumber":"7973374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7958418","xplore-issue":"7973374","articleId":"7973606","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Croatian Society MIPRO","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7973611,"authors":[{"name":"Andjela Dragani\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Montenegro, Podgorica, Montenegro"],"firstName":"Andjela","lastName":"Dragani\u0107","id":"38548056400"},{"name":"Milan Mari\u0107","affiliation":["S&T Cma Gora d.o.o, Podgorica, Montenegro"],"firstName":"Milan","lastName":"Mari\u0107","id":"37721930600"},{"name":"Irena Orovi\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Montenegro, Podgorica, Montenegro"],"firstName":"Irena","lastName":"Orovi\u0107","id":"37645659200"},{"name":"Srdjan Stankovi\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Montenegro, Podgorica, Montenegro"],"firstName":"Srdjan","lastName":"Stankovi\u0107","id":"37430155300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-953-233-090-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-953-233-092-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4969-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7973611","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Optimization","Cameras","Image reconstruction","Receivers","Monitoring","Matrix converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","digital signatures","feature extraction","image coding","image watermarking","optimisation","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image source identification","serial-number-based watermarking","compressive sensing","public key cryptography signature","PKCS","Trap View cloud system","watermark detection","image optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["digital watermarking","digital signature","public key","TrapView","watermarking"]}],"abstract":"Although the protection of ownership and the prevention of unauthorized manipulation of digital images becomes an important concern, there is also a big issue of image source origin authentication. This paper proposes a procedure for the identification of the image source and content by using the Public Key Cryptography Signature (PKCS). The procedure is based on the PKCS watermarking of the images captured with numerous automatic observing cameras in the Trap View cloud system. Watermark is created based on 32-bit PKCS serial number and embedded into the captured image. Watermark detection on the receiver side extracts the serial number and indicates the camera which captured the image by comparing the original and the extracted serial numbers. The watermarking procedure is designed to provide robustness to image optimization based on the Compressive Sensing approach. Also, the procedure is tested under various attacks and shows successful identification of ownership.","doi":"10.23919/MIPRO.2017.7973611","publicationTitle":"2017 40th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 40th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7958418/7973374/07973611.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/MIPRO.2017.7973611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7973374","startPage":"1227","endPage":"1232","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of image source using serial-number-based watermarking under Compressive Sensing conditions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973611","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Identification of image source using serial-number-based watermarking under Compressive Sensing conditions","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 May 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973611/","conferenceDate":"22-26 May 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17027342","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7973611/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of image source using serial-number-based watermarking under Compressive Sensing conditions","confLoc":"Opatija, Croatia","sourcePdf":"1227-1232.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049419S","chronDate":"22-26 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7958418","isNumber":"7973374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7958418","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7973374","articleId":"7973611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Croatian Society MIPRO","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7973622,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitris Geneiatakis","affiliation":["European Commission, Cyber and Digital Citizens' Security Unit, Ispra, Italy"],"firstName":"Dimitris","lastName":"Geneiatakis","id":"37563082900"},{"name":"Ioannis Kounelis","affiliation":["European Commission, Cyber and Digital Citizens' Security Unit, Ispra, Italy"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Kounelis","id":"38266570400"},{"name":"Ricardo Neisse","affiliation":["European Commission, Cyber and Digital Citizens' Security Unit, Ispra, Italy"],"firstName":"Ricardo","lastName":"Neisse","id":"37266867700"},{"name":"Igor Nai-Fovino","affiliation":["European Commission, Cyber and Digital Citizens' Security Unit, Ispra, Italy"],"firstName":"Igor","lastName":"Nai-Fovino","id":"37086004439"},{"name":"Gary Steri","affiliation":["European Commission, Cyber and Digital Citizens' Security Unit, Ispra, Italy"],"firstName":"Gary","lastName":"Steri","id":"37680681500"},{"name":"Gianmarco Baldini","affiliation":["European Commission, Cyber and Digital Citizens' Security Unit, Ispra, Italy"],"firstName":"Gianmarco","lastName":"Baldini","id":"37391401100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-953-233-090-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-953-233-092-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4969-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7973622","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7200},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart homes","Privacy","Security","Cloud computing","Computers","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data privacy","Internet of Things","security of data","software architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security issues","privacy issues","IoT based smart home","Internet of Things","data sharing","smart home architecture"]}],"abstract":"Internet of Things (IoT) can support numerous applications and services in various domains, such as smart cities and smart homes. IoT smart objects interact with other components e.g., proxies, mobile devices, and data collectors, for management, data sharing and other activities in the context of the provided service. Though such components contribute to address various societal challenges and provide new advanced services for users, their limited processing capabilities make them vulnerable to well-known security and privacy threats. Until now various research works have studied security and privacy in IoT, validating this claim. However, to the best of our knowledge literature lacks research focusing on security and privacy flaws introduced in IoT through interactions among different devices supporting a smart home architecture. In particular, we set up the scene for a security and privacy threat analysis for a typical smart home architecture using off the shelf components. To do so, we employ a smart home IoT architecture that enables users to interact with it through various devices that support smart house management, and we analyze different scenarios to identify possible security and privacy issues for users.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/MIPRO.2017.7973622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7973374","publicationTitle":"2017 40th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 40th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7958418/7973374/07973622.pdf","endPage":"1297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security and privacy issues for an IoT based smart home","doi":"10.23919/MIPRO.2017.7973622","startPage":"1292","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973622","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Security and privacy issues for an IoT based smart home","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973622/","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17027452","publicationDate":"May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7973622/","conferenceDate":"22-26 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security and privacy issues for an IoT based smart home","confLoc":"Opatija, Croatia","sourcePdf":"1292-1297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042121S","chronDate":"22-26 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7958418","isNumber":"7973374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7958418","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7973374","articleId":"7973622","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Croatian Society MIPRO","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7973626,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Because of its wide usage, cloud computing services became a common target of different cyber-attacks executed by insiders and outsiders. Therefore, cloud computing vendors and providers need to implement strong information security protection mechanisms on their cloud infrastructures. One approach that has been taken for successful threat detection that will lead to the successful attack prevention in cloud computing infrastructures is the application of machine learning algorithms. To understand how machine learning algorithms can be applied for cloud computing threat detection, we propose the cloud computing threat classification model based on the feasibility of machine learning algorithms to detect them. In this paper, we addressed three different criteria types, where we considered three types of classification: a) type of learning algorithm, b) input features and c) cloud computing level. Results proposed in this paper can contribute to further studies in the field of cloud threat detection with machine learning algorithms. More specifically, it will help in selecting appropriate input features, or machine learning algorithms, to obtain higher classification accuracy.","doi":"10.23919/MIPRO.2017.7973626","publicationTitle":"2017 40th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 40th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7958418/7973374/07973626.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/MIPRO.2017.7973626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7973374","startPage":"1314","endPage":"1318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud computing threats classification model based on the detection feasibility of machine learning algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973626","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cloud computing threats classification model based on the detection feasibility of machine learning algorithms","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 May 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973626/","conferenceDate":"22-26 May 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17027338","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7973626/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud computing threats classification model based on the detection feasibility of machine learning algorithms","confLoc":"Opatija, Croatia","sourcePdf":"1314-1318.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097892S","chronDate":"22-26 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7958418","isNumber":"7973374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7958418","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7973374","articleId":"7973626","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Croatian Society MIPRO","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7973689,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid Arabnejad","affiliation":["IC4, Dublin City University, Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Arabnejad","id":"38468338100"},{"name":"Claus Pahl","affiliation":["Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, Bolzano, Italy"],"firstName":"Claus","lastName":"Pahl","id":"37304101600"},{"name":"Pooyan Jamshidi","affiliation":["Imperial College London, London, London, GB"],"firstName":"Pooyan","lastName":"Jamshidi"},{"name":"Giovani Estrada","affiliation":["Intel, Leixlip, Ireland"],"firstName":"Giovani","lastName":"Estrada","id":"37085721196"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6611-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5980-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7973689","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":932},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Learning (artificial intelligence)","Fuzzy logic","Quality of service","Resource management","Time factors","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","contracts","fuzzy logic","fuzzy systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reinforcement learning","fuzzy cloud autoscaling","cloud service management","self-adaptable autoscaler","workload fluctuations","service-level agreements","dynamic controller design","dynamic learning strategies","fuzzy logic system","fuzzy scaling rules","self-adaptive fuzzy logic controller","fuzzy SARSA learning FSL","fuzzy Q-learning FQL","off-policy approach","on-policy approach","OpenStack cloud platform","load traffic situations","virtual machine","SLA compliance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Orchestration","Controller","Fuzzy Logic","Q-Learning","SARSA","OpenStack"]}],"abstract":"A goal of cloud service management is to design self-adaptable auto-scaler to react to workload fluctuations and changing the resources assigned. The key problem is how and when to add/remove resources in order to meet agreed service-level agreements. Reducing application cost and guaranteeing service-level agreements (SLAs) are two critical factors of dynamic controller design. In this paper, we compare two dynamic learning strategies based on a fuzzy logic system, which learns and modifies fuzzy scaling rules at runtime. A self-adaptive fuzzy logic controller is combined with two reinforcement learning (RL) approaches: (i) Fuzzy SARSA learning FSL and (ii) Fuzzy Q-learning FQL. As an off-policy approach, Q-learning learns independent of the policy currently followed, whereas SARSA as an on-policy always incorporates the actual agent's behavior and leads to faster learning. Both approaches are implemented and compared in their advantages and disadvantages, here in the OpenStack cloud platform. We demonstrate that both auto-scaling approaches can handle various load traffic situations, sudden and periodic, and delivering resources on demand while reducing operating costs and preventing SLA violations. The experimental results demonstrate that FSL and FQL have acceptable performance in terms of adjusted number of virtual machine targeted to optimize SLA compliance and response time.","doi":"10.1109/CCGRID.2017.15","publicationTitle":"2017 17th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGRID)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 17th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGRID)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7973338/7973673/07973689.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCGRID.2017.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7973673","startPage":"64","endPage":"73","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparison of Reinforcement Learning Techniques for Fuzzy Cloud Auto-Scaling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973689","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Comparison of Reinforcement Learning Techniques for Fuzzy Cloud Auto-Scaling","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973689/","conferenceDate":"14-17 May 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17030387","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7973689/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparison of Reinforcement Learning Techniques for Fuzzy Cloud Auto-Scaling","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"6611a064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062397S","chronDate":"14-17 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7973338","isNumber":"7973673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7973338","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7973673","articleId":"7973689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7973703,"authors":[{"name":"Longjie Ma","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Guangdong University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Longjie","lastName":"Ma","id":"37086043515"},{"name":"Jigang Wu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Guangdong University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Jigang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085999361"},{"name":"Long Chen","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Guangdong University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085999722"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6611-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5980-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7973703","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":355},"abstract":"In the large-scale Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN) consisting of many wireless Access Points (APs),choosing the appropriate position to place cloudlet is very important for reducing the user's access delay. For service provider, it isalways very costly to deployment cloudlets. How many cloudletsshould be placed in a WMAN and how much resource eachcloudlet should have is very important for the service provider. In this paper, we study the cloudlet placement and resourceallocation problem in a large-scale Wireless WMAN, we formulatethe problem as an novel cloudlet placement problem that givenan average access delay between mobile users and the cloudlets, place K cloudlets to some strategic locations in the WMAN withthe objective to minimize the number of use cloudlet K. Wethen propose an exact solution to the problem by formulatingit as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP). Due to the poorscalability of the ILP, we devise a clustering algorithm K-Medoids(KM) for the problem. For a special case of the problem whereall cloudlets computing capabilities have been given, we proposean efficient heuristic for it. We finally evaluate the performanceof the proposed algorithms through experimental simulations. Simulation result demonstrates that the proposed algorithms areeffective.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 17th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGRID)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7973338/7973673/07973703.pdf","startPage":"196","endPage":"203","publicationTitle":"2017 17th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGRID)","doi":"10.1109/CCGRID.2017.34","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCGRID.2017.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7973673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973703","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DOTA: Delay Bounded Optimal Cloudlet Deployment and User Association in WMANs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Delays","Mobile communication","Mobile handsets","Resource management","Computer architecture","Computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","integer programming","linear programming","metropolitan area networks","pattern clustering","radio access networks","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DOTA","delay bounded optimal cloudlet deployment","user association","WMANs","large-scale wireless metropolitan area network","wireless access points","cloudlet placement","resource allocation","integer linear programming","ILP","clustering algorithm","k-medoids","cloudlets computing capabilities"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloudlet placement","cloudlet number minimization","resource allocation","heuristic algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973703/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"DOTA: Delay Bounded Optimal Cloudlet Deployment and User Association in WMANs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7973703/","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17030327","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","conferenceDate":"14-17 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DOTA: Delay Bounded Optimal Cloudlet Deployment and User Association in WMANs","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"6611a196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117609S","chronDate":"14-17 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7973338","isNumber":"7973673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7973338","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7973673","articleId":"7973703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7973709,"authors":[{"name":"Elena Agostini","affiliation":["NVIDIA and National Research Council of Italy, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Elena","lastName":"Agostini","id":"37086024421"},{"name":"Davide Rossetti","affiliation":["NVIDIA, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Davide","lastName":"Rossetti","id":"37565824200"},{"name":"Sreeram Potluri","affiliation":["NVIDIA, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sreeram","lastName":"Potluri","id":"37902624900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6611-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5980-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7973709","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1057},"abstract":"NVIDIA GPUDirect is a family of technologies aimed at optimizing data movement among GPUs (P2P) or between GPUs and third-party devices (RDMA). GPUDirect Async, introduced in CUDA 8.0, is a new addition which allows direct synchronization between GPU and third party devices. For example, Async allows an NVIDIA GPU to directly trigger and poll for completion of communication operations queued to an InfiniBand Connect-IB network adapter, removing CPU involvement from the critical path in GPU accelerated applications. In this paper, we present the building blocks of GPUDirect Async and explain the supported usage models of this new technology. We also present a performance evaluation using a micro-benchmark and a synthetic stencil benchmark. Finally, we demonstrate the use of Async in a few multi-GPU MPI applications: HPGMG-FV (geometric multi-grid), achieving up to 25% improvement in total execution time; CoMD-CUDA (classical molecular dynamics), reducing communications times up to 30%; LULESH2-CUDA, achieving an average performance improvement of 13% in the total execution time.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 17th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGRID)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7973338/7973673/07973709.pdf","startPage":"248","endPage":"257","publicationTitle":"2017 17th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGRID)","doi":"10.1109/CCGRID.2017.29","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCGRID.2017.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7973673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Offloading Communication Control Logic in GPU Accelerated Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing units","Kernel","Registers","Computational modeling","Libraries","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","graphics processing units","message passing","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication control logic","GPU accelerated applications","GPUDirect Async","multiGPU MPI applications","HPGMG-FV","geometric multigrid","CoMD-CUDA","molecular dynamics","LULESH2-CUDA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GPUDirect Async","CUDA 8.0","InfiniBand","asynchronous communications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973709/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Offloading Communication Control Logic in GPU Accelerated Applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7973709/","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17030267","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","conferenceDate":"14-17 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Offloading Communication Control Logic in GPU Accelerated Applications","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"6611a248.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053089S","chronDate":"14-17 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7973338","isNumber":"7973673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7973338","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7973673","articleId":"7973709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7973729,"authors":[{"name":"Rashid Tahir","affiliation":["University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign"],"firstName":"Rashid","lastName":"Tahir","id":"38577004800"},{"name":"Ali Raza","affiliation":["University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Raza","id":"37085714679"},{"name":"Mazhar Naqvi","affiliation":["Lahore University of Management Sciences"],"firstName":"Mazhar","lastName":"Naqvi","id":"37086121452"},{"name":"Fareed Zaffar","affiliation":["Lahore University of Management Sciences"],"firstName":"Fareed","lastName":"Zaffar","id":"37563416400"},{"name":"Matthew Caesar","affiliation":["Lahore University of Management Sciences"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Caesar","id":"37085856203"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6611-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5980-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7973729","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":218},"abstract":"The vast attack surface of clouds presents a challenge in deploying scalable and effective defenses. Traditional security mechanisms, which work from inside the VM fail to provide strong protection as attackers can bypass them easily. The only available option is to provide security from the layer below the VM i.e., the hypervisor. Previous works that attempt to secure VMs from \"outside\" either incur substantial space or compute overheads making them slow and impractical or require modifications to the OS or the application codebase. To address these issues, we propose an anomaly detection fabric for clouds based on system call monitoring, which compresses the stream of system calls at their source making the system scalable and near real-time. Our system requires no modifications to the guest OS or the application making it ideal for the data center setting. Additionally, for robust and early detection of threats, we leverage the notion of VM/container communities that share information about attacks in their early stages to provide immunity to the entire deployment. We make certain aspects of the system flexible so that vendors can tune metrics to offer customized protection to clients based on their workload types. Detailed evaluation on a prototype implementation on KVM substantiates our claims.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 17th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGRID)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7973338/7973673/07973729.pdf","startPage":"431","endPage":"441","publicationTitle":"2017 17th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGRID)","doi":"10.1109/CCGRID.2017.61","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCGRID.2017.61","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7973673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Anomaly Detection Fabric for Clouds Based on Collaborative VM Communities","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Training","Fabrics","Cloud computing","Containers","Security","Runtime"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","groupware","security of data","system monitoring","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collaborative VM communities","anomaly detection fabric","system call monitoring","VM-container communities","KVM","virtual machine"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["clouds","anomaly detection","behavior profiling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973729/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"An Anomaly Detection Fabric for Clouds Based on Collaborative VM Communities","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7973729/","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17030256","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","conferenceDate":"14-17 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Anomaly Detection Fabric for Clouds Based on Collaborative VM Communities","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"6611a431.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083594S","chronDate":"14-17 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7973338","isNumber":"7973673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7973338","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7973673","articleId":"7973729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7973732,"authors":[{"name":"Deepak K.

Blockchain's public and distributed peer-to-peer ledger capability benefits cloud computing services which require functions such as, assured data provenance, auditing, management of digital assets, and distributed consensus. Blockchain's underlying consensus mechanism allows to build a tamper-proof environment, where transactions on any digital assets are verified by set of authentic participants or miners. With use of strong cryptographic methods, blocks of transactions are chained together to enable immutability on the records. However, achieving consensus demands computational power from the miners in exchange of handsome reward. Therefore, greedy miners always try to exploit the system by augmenting their mining power. In this paper, we first discuss blockchain's capability in providing assured data provenance in cloud and present vulnerabilities in blockchain cloud. We model the block withholding (BWH) attack in a blockchain cloud considering distinct pool reward mechanisms. BWH attack provides rogue miner ample resources in the blockchain cloud for disrupting honest miners' mining efforts, which was verified through simulations.","doi":"10.1109/CCGRID.2017.111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCGRID.2017.111","startPage":"458","endPage":"467","publicationTitle":"2017 17th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGRID)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 17th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGRID)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7973338/7973673/07973732.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7973673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security Implications of Blockchain Cloud with Analysis of Block Withholding Attack","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973732/","conferenceDate":"14-17 May 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Security Implications of Blockchain Cloud with Analysis of Block Withholding Attack","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17030272","publicationDate":"May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7973732/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security Implications of Blockchain Cloud with Analysis of Block Withholding Attack","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"6611a458.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074189S","chronDate":"14-17 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7973338","isNumber":"7973673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7973338","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7973673","articleId":"7973732","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7973733,"authors":[{"name":"Xueping Liang","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Tennessee State University, Nashville, TN"],"firstName":"Xueping","lastName":"Liang","id":"37085990188"},{"name":"Sachin Shetty","affiliation":["Virginia Modeling Analysis and Simulation Center, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA"],"firstName":"Sachin","lastName":"Shetty","id":"37306356900"},{"name":"Deepak Tosh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Norfolk State University, Norfolk, VA"],"firstName":"Deepak","lastName":"Tosh","id":"37085365832"},{"name":"Charles Kamhoua","affiliation":["Cyber Assurance Branch, Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome, NY"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Kamhoua","id":"37704581200"},{"name":"Kevin Kwiat","affiliation":["Cyber Assurance Branch, Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome, NY"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Kwiat","id":"37282220700"},{"name":"Laurent Njilla","affiliation":["Cyber Assurance Branch, Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome, NY"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Njilla","id":"37085453331"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6611-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5980-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7973733","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":134,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5562},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Computer architecture","Data privacy","Security","History","Data models","Privacy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data integrity","data privacy","meta data","reliability","trusted computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blockchain-based data provenance architecture","trusted cloud data provenance architecture","decentralized cloud data provenance architecture","tamper-proof records","data accountability","provenance data availability","ProvChain","provenance data collection","provenance data storage","provenance data validation","user privacy","cloud storage applications","metadata"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data provenance","Blockchain","Cloud Computing","Privacy","Reliability","Blockchain Cloud"]}],"abstract":"Cloud data provenance is metadata that records the history of the creation and operations performed on a cloud data object.

We make use of the cloud storage scenario and choose the cloud file as a data unit to detect user operations for collecting provenance data. We design and implement ProvChain, an architecture to collect and verify cloud data provenance, by embedding the provenance data into blockchain transactions.

Optimizing the memory allocation to data storage is critical to delivering performance to traditional HPC compute jobs and throughput to data-intensive applications sharing the HPC resources. Current practices that statically configure in-memory storage may leave inadequate space for compute jobs or miss the opportunity to utilize available space for data-intensive applications. In this paper, we explore techniques to dynamically adjust in-memory storage allocation and provide optimum memory to compute jobs. We have developed a dynamic in-memory storage controller, DynIMS, which monitors memory demands of compute tasks in real time and employs a feedback-based control mechanism to adapt the allocation of in-memory storage. We test DynIMS using HPCC and Spark workloads on a HPC cluster. Experimental results show that DynIMS can achieve up to 5X performance improvement compared to systems with static memory allocations.","doi":"10.1109/CCGRID.2017.66","publicationTitle":"2017 17th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGRID)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 17th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGRID)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7973338/7973673/07973742.pdf","startPage":"549","endPage":"558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7973673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCGRID.2017.66","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Management of In-Memory Storage for Efficiently Integrating Compute-and Data-Intensive Computing on HPC Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973742/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Management of In-Memory Storage for Efficiently Integrating Compute-and Data-Intensive Computing on HPC Systems","htmlLink":"/document/7973742/","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17030386","conferenceDate":"14-17 May 2017","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Management of In-Memory Storage for Efficiently Integrating Compute-and Data-Intensive Computing on HPC Systems","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"6611a549.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070976S","chronDate":"14-17 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7973338","isNumber":"7973673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7973338","xplore-issue":"7973673","articleId":"7973742","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7973744,"authors":[{"name":"Junjie Qian","affiliation":["University of Nebraska-Lincoln"],"firstName":"Junjie","lastName":"Qian","id":"37085387232"},{"name":"Hong Jiang","affiliation":["University of Texas-Arlington"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37086066579"},{"name":"Witawas Srisa-An","affiliation":["University of Nebraska-Lincoln"],"firstName":"Witawas","lastName":"Srisa-An","id":"38276900500"},{"name":"Sharad Seth","affiliation":["University of Nebraska-Lincoln"],"firstName":"Sharad","lastName":"Seth","id":"37269972600"},{"name":"Stan Skelton","affiliation":["NetApp Inc"],"firstName":"Stan","lastName":"Skelton","id":"37085724323"},{"name":"Joseph Moore","affiliation":["NetApp Inc"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Moore","id":"37085729781"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6611-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5980-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7973744","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":561},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973744","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonvolatile memory","Linux","Energy consumption","Sockets","Throughput","Program processors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories","power aware computing","random-access storage","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NVMe SSD","nonvolatile memory express","runtime behaviors","Linux-based NUMA system","ESN","energy-efficient profiling-based I/O thread scheduler","I/O throughput","CPU contention"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NVMe","NUMA","I/O Scheduler","Energy-efficient"]}],"abstract":"Non-volatile memory express (NVMe) based SSDs and the NUMA platform are widely adopted in servers to achieve faster storage speed and more powerful processing capability. As of now, very little research has been conducted to investigate the performance and energy efficiency of the state-of-the-art NUMA architecture integrated with NVMe SSDs, an emerging technology used to host parallel I/O threads. As this technology continues to be widely developed and adopted, we need to understand the runtime behaviors of such systems in order to design software runtime systems that deliver optimal performance while consuming only the necessary amount of energy. This paper characterizes the runtime behaviors of a Linux-based NUMA system employing multiple NVMe SSDs. Our comprehensive performance and energy-efficiency study using massive numbers of parallel I/O threads shows that the penalty due to CPU contention is much smaller than that due to remote access of NVMe SSDs. Based on this insight, we develop a dynamic \"lesser evil\" algorithm called ESN, to minimize the impact of these two types of penalties. ESN is an energy-efficient profiling-based I/O thread scheduler for managing I/O threads accessing NVMe SSDs on NUMA systems. Our empirical evaluation shows that ESN can achieve optimal I/O throughput and latency while consuming up to 50% less energy and using fewer CPUs.","doi":"10.1109/CCGRID.2017.24","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCGRID.2017.24","startPage":"569","endPage":"578","publicationTitle":"2017 17th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGRID)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 17th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGRID)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7973338/7973673/07973744.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7973673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient I/O Thread Schedulers for NVMe SSDs on NUMA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973744/","conferenceDate":"14-17 May 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient I/O Thread Schedulers for NVMe SSDs on NUMA","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17030264","publicationDate":"May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7973744/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient I/O Thread Schedulers for NVMe SSDs on NUMA","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"6611a569.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077991S","chronDate":"14-17 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7973338","isNumber":"7973673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7973338","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7973673","articleId":"7973744","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7973745,"authors":[{"name":"Oussama Soualah","affiliation":["Telecom SudParis, Institut Mines-Telecom, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Oussama","lastName":"Soualah","id":"37085426445"},{"name":"Marouen Mechtri","affiliation":["Telecom SudParis, Institut Mines-Telecom, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Marouen","lastName":"Mechtri","id":"37892336100"},{"name":"Chaima Ghribi","affiliation":["Telecom SudParis, Institut Mines-Telecom, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Chaima","lastName":"Ghribi","id":"37070147600"},{"name":"Djamal Zeghlache","affiliation":["Telecom SudParis, Institut Mines-Telecom, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Djamal","lastName":"Zeghlache","id":"37269221800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6611-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5980-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7973745","dbTime":"47 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":861},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Servers","Decision trees","Software algorithms","Bandwidth","Energy consumption","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computational complexity","decision trees","energy conservation","Monte Carlo methods","optimisation","polynomials","tree searching","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficient algorithm","VNF placement","VNF chaining","NFV enabled infrastructures","decision tree search","NP-hard problem complexity","Monte Carlo tree search","MCTS","energy savings","physical resource consolidation","VNF sharing","energy consumption reduction","polynomial complexity","cloud technologies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy efficiency","VNF placement and chaining","Green","Decision tree search","SFC","MCTS"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses energy efficient VNF placement and chaining over NFV enabled infrastructures.

Compared to centralized schedulers, existing sample-based schedulers do not hold a global view of the cluster's resource status. Instead, the scheduling decisions are made solely based on the status of a small set of randomly sampled workers. Although this simple approach is highly efficient in large clusters, the lack of global knowledge of the cluster can lead to sub-optimal task placement decisions and difficulties in enforcing global scheduling policies. In this paper, we address these challenges in existing sample-based scheduling approaches by allowing the scheduler to maintain an approximate version of the global resource status through caching the worker node's status extracted from reply messages. More specifically, we introduce the private cluster-state technique (PCS) for the scheduler to obtain such global information. We show that the scheduler can make better scheduling decisions by utilizing PCS and the scheduler can become more capable in enforcing global scheduling policies. The use of PCS is of low cost since it does not initiate new communication in sample-based scheduling. Our approach is implemented in PSCSampler, a full distribute sample-based scheduler, which gains global knowledge from PCS. Experiment results from both simulation runs and Amazon cluster runs show that compared to Sparrow, PCSsampler can significantly reduce both 50\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup>\n percentile and 90\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup>\n percentile runtime.

However, existing data replication schemes do not place data based on heterogeneous device characteristics as well as considering distinct data access patterns. In this paper, we introduce a novel data replication scheme PRS to achieve efficient data replication for heterogeneous storage systems. Different from traditional schemes, the PRS groups objects according to data access patterns and distributes replicas to heterogeneous devices with their features. It uses a pseudo random algorithm to optimize replica layout by considering storage device performance and capacity.

The progress made in recent years cannot be understood without taking into account the technological advancements seen in key domains such as High Performance Computing, more specifically in the Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) domain. These kind of deep neural networks need massive amounts of data to effectively train the millions of parameters they contain, and this training can take up to days or weeks depending on the computer hardware we are using. In this work, we present how the training of a deep neural network can be parallelized on a distributed GPU cluster. The effect of distributing the training process is addressed from two different points of view. First, the scalability of the task and its performance in the distributed setting are analyzed. Second, the impact of distributed training methods on the training times and final accuracy of the models is studied. We used TensorFlow on top of the GPU cluster of servers with 2 K80 GPU cards, at Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC). The results show an improvement for both focused areas. On one hand, the experiments show promising results in order to train a neural network faster. The training time is decreased from 106 hours to 16 hours in our experiments. On the other hand we can observe how increasing the numbers of GPUs in one node rises the throughput, images per second, in a near-linear way. Morever an additional distributed speedup of 10.3 is achieved with 16 nodes taking as baseline the speedup of one node.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973757/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7973757/","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17030325","conferenceDate":"14-17 May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Scaling a Convolutional Neural Network for Classification of Adjective Noun Pairs with TensorFlow on GPU Clusters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scaling a Convolutional Neural Network for Classification of Adjective Noun Pairs with TensorFlow on GPU Clusters","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"6611a677.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078018S","chronDate":"14-17 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7973338","isNumber":"7973673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7973338","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7973673","articleId":"7973757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7973767,"authors":[{"name":"Juan Fang","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Fang","id":"37531946000"},{"name":"Qingwen Fan","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qingwen","lastName":"Fan","id":"37086058161"},{"name":"Xiaoting Hao","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoting","lastName":"Hao","id":"37086022530"},{"name":"Yanjin Cheng","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yanjin","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37086051861"},{"name":"Lijun Sun","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lijun","lastName":"Sun","id":"37086047771"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6611-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5980-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7973767","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":797},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing units","Algorithm design and analysis","Heuristic algorithms","System performance","Multicore processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","graphics processing units","microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems","optimisation","parallel processing","software architecture","software performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance optimization","cache replacement algorithm","CPU-GPU heterogeneous multicore architecture","cache memory","parallel computing","last-level-cache","LLC","least recently used","LRU","least frequently used","LFU"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CPU-GPU","heterogeneous multi-core","cache replacement algorithm","System performance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973767","abstract":"Cache memory helps in expediting the speed of data retrieval time in processors in heterogeneous multi-core architecture, which is the main factor that affects system performance and power consumption. The implementation algorithm of cache replacement in current heterogeneous multi-core environment is thread-blinded, leading to a lower utilization of the cache. In fact, each of the CPU and GPU applications has its own characteristics, where CPU is responsible for the implementation of tasks and serial logic control, while GPU has a great advantage in parallel computing, which causes the need of cache blocks for CPU more sensitive than those for GPU. With that in mind, this research gives full consideration to the increment of thread priority in the cache replacement algorithm and takes a novel strategy to improve the work efficiency of last-level-cache (LLC), where the CPU and GPU applications share LLC dynamically and not in an absolutely fair status. Furthermore, our methodology switches policies between the LRU (Least Recently Used) and LFU (Least Frequently Used) effectively by comparing the number of cache misses on the LLC, which takes both the time and frequency of the accessing cache block into consideration.

These processors are designed to flexibly support highly diverse workloads with classic techniques such as on-chip cache and dynamic pipelining. Yet, it is difficult for the on-chip cache to exploit irregular data locality in large-scale graph processing, even though there are a few high-degree vertices that are frequently accessed in real-world graphs, it is not efficient to perform regular arithmetic operations via sophisticated dynamic pipelining. In short, general-purpose processors could not be the ideal platforms to graph processing. In this paper, we design a reconfigurable graph processing accelerator, with the purpose of providing an energy-efficient and flexible hardware platform for large-scale graph processing. This accelerator features two main components, i.e., the on-chip storage to exploit the data locality of graph processing, and the reconfigurable functional units to adapt to diversified operations in different graph processing tasks. On a total of 36 practical graph processing tasks, we demonstrate that, on average, our accelerator design achieves 1.58x and 25.56x better performance and energy efficiency, respectively, than the GPU baseline.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973769/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17030343","htmlLink":"/document/7973769/","conferenceDate":"14-17 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"TuNao: A High-Performance and Energy-Efficient Reconfigurable Accelerator for Graph Processing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TuNao: A High-Performance and Energy-Efficient Reconfigurable Accelerator for Graph Processing","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"6611a731.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114631S","chronDate":"14-17 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7973338","isNumber":"7973673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7973338","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7973673","articleId":"7973769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7973775,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086079057"},{"name":"Changlong Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Changlong","lastName":"Li","id":"37085370072"},{"name":"Hang Zhuang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Zhuang","id":"37085354075"},{"name":"Jiali Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Jiali","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086076640"},{"name":"Qingfeng Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Qingfeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086080550"},{"name":"Jinhong Zhou","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Jinhong","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085342747"},{"name":"Xuehai Zhou","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xuehai","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085340896"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6611-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5980-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7973775","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"abstract":"Sequence alignment algorithms are a basic and critical component of many bioinformatics fields.

Since then it has become easier to sequence genomes of individuals due to rapid advancements in technology, which in turn has created a need to represent the new information using a different representation. Several attempts have been made to represent the genome sequence as a graph albeit for different purposes. Here we take a look at the Variant Calling Format (VCF) file which carries information about variations within genomes and is the primary format of choice for genome analysis tools.

Edge computing provides the necessary on-demand computing power for Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices where it is needed. Computing power is moved closer to the consumer, with the effect of reducing latency and increasing fail-safety due to absent centralized structures. This is an enabler for applications requiring high-bandwidth uplinks and low latencies to computing units. In this paper, a new use case for edge computing is identified. Mobile devices can overcome their battery limitations and performance constraints by dynamically using the edge-computing-provided computational power. We call this new technology Hybrid Mobile Edge Computing. We present a general architecture and framework, which targets the mobile device use case of hybrid mobile edge computing, not only considering the improvement of performance and energy consumption, but also providing means to protect user privacy, sensitive data and computations. The achieved results are backed by the results of our analysis, targeting the energy saving potentials and possible performance improvements.","doi":"10.1109/CCGRID.2017.125","publicationTitle":"2017 17th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGRID)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 17th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGRID)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7973338/7973673/07973801.pdf","startPage":"935","endPage":"944","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7973673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCGRID.2017.125","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973801","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Mobile Edge Computing: Unleashing the Full Potential of Edge Computing in Mobile Device Use Cases","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973801/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Mobile Edge Computing: Unleashing the Full Potential of Edge Computing in Mobile Device Use Cases","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17030269","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","publicationDate":"May 2017","conferenceDate":"14-17 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7973801/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Mobile Edge Computing: Unleashing the Full Potential of Edge Computing in Mobile Device Use Cases","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"6611a935.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079358S","chronDate":"14-17 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7973338","isNumber":"7973673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7973338","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7973673","articleId":"7973801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7973803,"authors":[{"name":"Sandra Mendez","affiliation":["High Performance Systems Division, Garching bei M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Sandra","lastName":"Mendez","id":"38020392300"},{"name":"Dolores Rexachs","affiliation":["Computer Architecture and Operating Systems Department, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Dolores","lastName":"Rexachs","id":"37299965900"},{"name":"Emilio Luque","affiliation":["Computer Architecture and Operating Systems Department, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Emilio","lastName":"Luque","id":"37299737900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6611-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5980-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7973803","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973803","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Performance evaluation","Tools","Electronic mail","Kernel","Supercomputers","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["input-output programs","mainframes","message passing","parallel processing","software performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel I/O severity","MPI applications","performance evaluation","high performance computing","HPC","SuperMUC supercomputer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HPC Systems","Parallel I/O","Parallel File System","I/O Severity","I/O system"]}],"abstract":"Performance evaluation of parallel applications plays an important role in High Performance Computing (HPC).

We define the I/O severity concept taking into account the I/O requirements of a parallel application, the mapping of I/O processes and the configuration of the I/O subsystem. Requirements are expressed in units denominated I/O phases, which are defined using the temporal and spatial pattern of different files of the application. Our approach is applied to the I/O kernels of scientific applications such as S3DIO, FLASH-IO and BT-IO on the SuperMUC supercomputer.

One of the most common key strategies to reduce the power consumption of data centers is the consolidation of virtual machines, whose effectiveness strongly depends on a reliable forecasting of future computational resource needs. In fact, servers are typically configured to handle peak workload conditions even if they are often under-utilized, that results in a wastefulness of resources and inefficient energy consumption. Motivated by these issues, this paper describes a data-driven approach based on auto-regressive models to dynamically forecast virtual machine workloads, for energy-aware allocations of virtual machines on Cloud physical nodes. Virtual machine migrations across physical servers are periodically done on the basis of the estimated virtual machine demands, by minimizing the number of active servers. Experimental results show encouraging benefits in terms of energy saving, while satisfying performance constraints and service level agreement established with users.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973815/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7973815/","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17030259","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Data-Driven Approach Based on Auto-Regressive Models for Energy-Efficient Clouds","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Data-Driven Approach Based on Auto-Regressive Models for Energy-Efficient Clouds","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"6611b062.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061827S","chronDate":"14-17 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7973338","isNumber":"7973673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7973338","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7973673","articleId":"7973815","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7973818,"authors":[{"name":"Carlo Di Giulio","affiliation":["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"],"firstName":"Carlo Di","lastName":"Giulio","id":"37086035702"},{"name":"Read Sprabery","affiliation":["Air Force Research Laboratory"],"firstName":"Read","lastName":"Sprabery","id":"37085551736"},{"name":"Charles Kamhoua","affiliation":["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Kamhoua","id":"37704581200"},{"name":"Kevin Kwiat","affiliation":["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Kwiat","id":"37282220700"},{"name":"Roy Campbell","affiliation":["Air Force Research Laboratory"],"firstName":"Roy","lastName":"Campbell","id":"37269622200"},{"name":"Masooda N.

However, the appearance of new service models such as cloud computing has brought new threats to information assurance, weakening the protection that existing standards can provide. In this study, we analyze four highly regarded IT security standards used to assess, improve, and demonstrate information systems assurance and cloud security. ISO/IEC 27001, SOC 2, C5, and FedRAMP are standards adopted worldwide and constantly updated and improved since the first release of ISO in 2005. We examine their adequacy in addressing current threats to cloud security, and provide an overview of the evolution over the years of their ability to cope with threats and vulnerabilities. By comparing the standards alongside each other, we investigate their complementarity, their redundancies, and the level of protection they offer to information stored in cloud systems. We unveil vulnerabilities left unaddressed in the four frameworks, thus questioning the necessity of multiple standards to assess cloud assurance. We suggest necessary improvements to meet the security requirements made indispensable by the current threat landscape.","doi":"10.1109/CCGRID.2017.137","publicationTitle":"2017 17th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGRID)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 17th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGRID)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7973338/7973673/07973818.pdf","startPage":"1090","endPage":"1099","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCGRID.2017.137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7973673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IT Security and Privacy Standards in Comparison: Improving FedRAMP Authorization for Cloud Service Providers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973818/","displayDocTitle":"IT Security and Privacy Standards in Comparison: Improving FedRAMP Authorization for Cloud Service Providers","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7973818/","publicationDate":"May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","conferenceDate":"14-17 May 2017","accessionNumber":"17030321","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IT Security and Privacy Standards in Comparison: Improving FedRAMP Authorization for Cloud Service Providers","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"6611b090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073847S","chronDate":"14-17 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7973338","isNumber":"7973673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7973338","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7973673","articleId":"7973818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7973902,"authors":[{"name":"Po-Wei Huang","affiliation":["Ancestry.com, Content Recognition Group, Lehi, Utah, United States"],"firstName":"Po-Wei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086029332"},{"name":"Tzu-Hsuan Chang","affiliation":["Ancestry.com, Content Recognition Group, Lehi, Utah, United States"],"firstName":"Tzu-Hsuan","lastName":"Chang","id":"37086102978"},{"name":"Meng-Ju Lee","affiliation":["Ancestry.com, Content Recognition Group, Lehi, Utah, United States"],"firstName":"Meng-Ju","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086109028"},{"name":"Tzu-Min Lin","firstName":"Tzu-Min","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086019695"},{"name":"Meng-Liang Chung","firstName":"Meng-Liang","lastName":"Chung","id":"37086021797"},{"name":"Bing-Fei Wu","firstName":"Bing-Fei","lastName":"Wu","id":"37275267600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4108-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4109-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7973902","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":474},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973902","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Temperature measurement","Estimation","Temperature sensors","Artificial neural networks","Biomedical measurement","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["body sensor networks","embedded systems","face recognition","fuzzy control","health care","infrared imaging","neural nets","object tracking","physiology","regression analysis","temperature measurement","wearable computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded non-contact body temperature measurement","automatic face tracking","neural network regression","automatic temperature estimation","wearable sensor technologies","WST","infrared thermography","IRT","non-contact infrared thermometer","NCIT","skin irritation risk","medical instrument level","real-time human temperature","fuzzy-control","Pan-tilt unit","wireless communication","physiological information","remote healthcare"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Temperature Estimation","Neural Network Regression","Automatic Face-tracking","Fuzzy-control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CACS.2016.7973902","pdfPath":"/iel7/7959774/7973873/07973902.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Automatic Control Conference (CACS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Automatic Control Conference (CACS)","startPage":"161","endPage":"166","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7973873","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CACS.2016.7973902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Embedded Non-Contact Body Temperature Measurement System with Automatic Face Tracking and Neural Network Regression","abstract":"In the last decade, many advances have been made in the field of automatic temperature estimation, including wearable sensor technologies (WST), infrared thermography (IRT), and non-contact infrared thermometer (NCIT). In contrast with the WST and IRT, NCIT is inexpensive without the risk of potential skin irritation. Nevertheless, NCIT is limited in short valid estimation distance (<;12 cm), resulting in the non-satisfaction of the surging application requirements nowadays. This paper proposed an algorithm based on Neural Network Regression not only to reduce the error from 0.6\u00b0 to 0.12\u00b0, which is close to the medical instrument level, but as well to lengthen the valid distance to the range between 50 cm and 100 cm. Furthermore, this study developed an embedded automatic body temperature estimation system which could continuously and unconsciously measure the human temperature in real-time. Integrated with face tracking and fuzzy-control of Pan-tilt unit, the system ensures that human face is focused while measuring. With wireless communication techniques, users can review their physiological Information via App and Web, which is beneficial to remote healthcare.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Nov. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7973902/","accessionNumber":"17027803","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7973902/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","conferenceDate":"9-11 Nov. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Embedded Non-Contact Body Temperature Measurement System with Automatic Face Tracking and Neural Network Regression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Embedded Non-Contact Body Temperature Measurement System with Automatic Face Tracking and Neural Network Regression","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"1081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098922S","chronDate":"9-11 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7959774","isNumber":"7973873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7959774","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7973873","articleId":"7973902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7973982,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaogang Li","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin Province, China"],"firstName":"Xiaogang","lastName":"Li","id":"37089072837"},{"name":"Hongbo Wang","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin Province, China"],"firstName":"Hongbo","lastName":"Wang","id":"38667423900"},{"name":"Qin Wu","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin Province, China"],"firstName":"Qin","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086143018"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6260-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6261-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7973982","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":231},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Marine vehicles","Meteorology","Routing","Optimization","Navigation","Mathematical model","Safety"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["environmental factors","genetic algorithms","numerical analysis","Pareto optimisation","ships","vehicle routing","weather forecasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective optimization","ship weather routing problem","transoceanic voyages","voyage time","voyage risk","multiobjective evolutionary algorithm","NSGA-II","nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II","Pareto optimal routes set","weight coefficient","mathematical model","numerical simulation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7973982","doi":"10.1109/CNSA.2017.7973982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNSA.2017.7973982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7973921","publicationTitle":"2017 Constructive Nonsmooth Analysis and Related Topics (dedicated to the memory of V.F.

This system not only feeds the power to the grid but it also provides the load compensation, power factor correction and harmonics elimination. For this, a double stage system is used where first stage is a DC-DC boost converter, which performs the MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking). For extracting maximum power from the PV string, an incremental conductance based MPPT algorithm is used. Moreover, in second stage a voltage source converter (VSC) is utilized. For control of VSC, a damped-SOGI (Second Order Generalized Integrator) algorithm is proposed. By using damped-SOGI based control algorithm, fundamental active and reactive power components of load currents are extracted for estimating the reference grid currents. After comparing these reference grid currents with sensed grid currents, these produce the switching pulses for the grid tied VSC. A prototype of the proposed system is developed in the laboratory. Test results are shown to validate the design and control algorithm under steady state and dynamic conditions at linear and nonlinear loads.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Algorithm design and analysis","Estimation","Industrial power systems","Petroleum","Chemical industry","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonics suppression","maximum power point trackers","photovoltaic power systems","power factor correction","power generation control","power supply quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear loads","switching pulses","sensed grid currents","reference grid currents","reactive power components","VSC","voltage source converter","incremental conductance based MPPT algorithm","maximum power point tracking","DC-DC boost converter","harmonics elimination","load compensation","power factor correction","three-phase distribution system","power quality","solar PV power generating system","damped-SOGI based control algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Solar Photovoltaic","MPPT","Damped-SOGI Algorithm","Power Quality","Grid Interfaced"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CICPS.2015.7974073","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE IAS Joint Industrial and Commercial Power Systems / Petroleum and Chemical Industry Conference (ICPSPCIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE IAS Joint Industrial and Commercial Power Systems / Petroleum and Chemical Industry Conference (ICPSPCIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966448/7974041/07974073.pdf","startPage":"189","endPage":"196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974041","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICPS.2015.7974073","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Damped-SOGI based control algorithm for solar PV power generating system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974073","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Damped-SOGI based control algorithm for solar PV power generating system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974073/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7974073/","accessionNumber":"17028656","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damped-SOGI based control algorithm for solar PV power generating system","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"ICPSPCIC032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053718S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7966448","isNumber":"7974041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966448","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7974041","articleId":"7974073","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7974095,"authors":[{"name":"Irem Boybat","affiliation":["IBM Research -

The image sensor employs in-pixel pulse-frequency modulation and column wise pulse counters to produce compressed samples. A common problem of compressive sampling applied to image sensors is that the size of a full-frame compressive strategy is too large to be stored in an on-chip memory. Since this matrix has to be transmitted to or from the reconstruction system its size would also prevent practical applications. A full-frame compressive strategy generated using a 1-D cellular automaton showing a class III behavior neither needs a storage memory nor needs to be continuously transmitted. In-pixel pulse frequency modulation and up-down counters allow the generation of differential compressed samples directly in the digital domain where it is easier to improve the required dynamic range. These solutions combined together improve the accuracy of the compressed samples thus improving the performance of any generic reconstruction algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/PRIME.2017.7974098","publicationTitle":"2017 13th Conference on Ph.D. Research in Microelectronics and Electronics (PRIME)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 13th Conference on Ph.D. Research in Microelectronics and Electronics (PRIME)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7964017/7974086/07974098.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PRIME.2017.7974098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974086","startPage":"25","endPage":"28","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive image sensor architecture with on-chip measurement matrix generation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974098","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressive image sensor architecture with on-chip measurement matrix generation","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 June 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974098/","conferenceDate":"12-15 June 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17028371","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7974098/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive image sensor architecture with on-chip measurement matrix generation","confLoc":"Giardini Naxos - Taormina, Italy","sourcePdf":"007P111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07116S","chronDate":"12-15 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7964017","isNumber":"7974086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7964017","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7974086","articleId":"7974098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7974101,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this paper, an approximate multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) unit is introduced. The MAC partial product terms are compressed by using simple OR gates as approximate counters; moreover, to further save energy, selected columns of the partial product terms are not formed. A compensation term is introduced in the proposed MAC, to reduce the overall approximation error. A MAC unit, specialized to perform 2D convolution, is designed following the proposed approach and implemented in TSMC 40nm technology in four different configurations. The proposed circuits achieve power savings more than 60%, compared to standard, exact MAC, with tolerable image quality degradation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Kernel","Image coding","Approximation error","Convolution","Digital circuits","Two dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["counting circuits","digital circuits","logic gates","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power approximate MAC unit","digital circuit performance","approximate multiply-and-accumulate unit","approximate MAC unit","MAC partial product","simple-OR gates","approximate counters","energy saving","partial product terms","compensation term","overall approximation error","2D convolution","TSMC technology","image quality degradation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Approximate computing","Truncated multipliers","Approximate MAC Unit","Imprecise hardware","Error compensation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974112","doi":"10.1109/PRIME.2017.7974112","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 13th Conference on Ph.D. Research in Microelectronics and Electronics (PRIME)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7964017/7974086/07974112.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PRIME.2017.7974112","startPage":"81","endPage":"84","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974086","publicationTitle":"2017 13th Conference on Ph.D. Research in Microelectronics and Electronics (PRIME)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-power approximate MAC unit","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-power approximate MAC unit","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974112/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 June 2017","conferenceDate":"12-15 June 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7974112/","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17028304","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-power approximate MAC unit","confLoc":"Giardini Naxos - Taormina, Italy","sourcePdf":"021P77.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128602S","chronDate":"12-15 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7964017","isNumber":"7974086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7964017","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7974086","articleId":"7974112","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7974116,"authors":[{"name":"Giulia Stazi","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Engineering, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Giulia","lastName":"Stazi","id":"37086191924"},{"name":"Francesco Menichelli","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Engineering, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Menichelli","id":"37662366900"},{"name":"Antonio Mastrandrea","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Engineering, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Mastrandrea","id":"37706819000"},{"name":"Mauro Olivieri","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Engineering, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Mauro","lastName":"Olivieri","id":"37268497400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6508-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6507-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6509-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7974116","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":327},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Resource management","Memory management","Random access memory","Linux","Hardware","Approximate computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Linux","operating system kernels","paged storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Linux operating system kernel","approximate memory banks","memory cells","read/write faults","controlled probability","approximate memory","memory fault probability","OS level","approximate memory management","approximate physical memories","exact physical memories","page pool management","allocation request management","fallback allocation policies"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the implementation of approximate memory support in Linux operating system kernel. The new functionality allows the kernel to distinguish between normal memory banks, which are composed by standard memory cells that retain data without corruption, and approximate memory banks, where memory cells are subject to read/write faults with controlled probability. Approximate memories are part of the wider research topic regarding approximate computing and error tolerant applications, in which errors in computation are allowed at different levels (data level, instruction level, algorithmic level). In general these errors are the result of circuital or architectural techniques (i.e. voltage scaling, refresh rate reduction) which trade off energy savings for the occurrence of errors in data processing. The ability to support approximate memory in the OS is required by many proposed techniques which try to save energy by raising memory fault probability, but the requirements at OS level have never been described and an actual implementation has never been proposed. In this paper we provide an analysis of the requirements and a description of the implementation of approximate memory management. Our approach allows Linux kernel to be aware of exact (normal) and approximate physical memories, managing them as a whole for the common part (e.g. optimization algorithms, page reuse) but distinguishing them in term of allocation requests and page pools management. The new kernel has been built and extensively tested on a hardware \u00d786 platform, showing the correctness of the implementation and of the fallback allocation policies.","publicationTitle":"2017 13th Conference on Ph.D. Research in Microelectronics and Electronics (PRIME)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 13th Conference on Ph.D. Research in Microelectronics and Electronics (PRIME)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7964017/7974086/07974116.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Introducing approximate memory support in Linux Kernel","doi":"10.1109/PRIME.2017.7974116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974086","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PRIME.2017.7974116","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974116","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974116/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Introducing approximate memory support in Linux Kernel","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17028369","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7974116/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Introducing approximate memory support in Linux Kernel","confLoc":"Giardini Naxos - Taormina, Italy","sourcePdf":"025P52.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047944S","chronDate":"12-15 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7964017","isNumber":"7974086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7964017","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7974086","articleId":"7974116","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7974125,"authors":[{"name":"D.

A current with small temperature coefficient is derived by exploiting the zero temperature coefficient (ZTC) operating point of a MOS transistor. The transistor is used in a feedback loop to cancel the temperature dependence of a polysilicon resistor. It is shown that simple equations together with fast simulations of the ZTC point and a special temperature coefficient can quickly yield an accurate design. Measurements from 10 samples show an average current of 6 \u03bcA with a standard deviation of 2.3 %, a voltage dependence of 0.3 %/V whereas the temperature coefficient is approximately 130 ppm/\u00b0C measured over a temperature range from -40 \u00b0C to 125 \u00b0C. The circuit compares favorably with other published untrimmed current references.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 June 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974160/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17028283","publicationDate":"June 2017","conferenceDate":"12-15 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7974160/","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A stable CMOS current reference based on the ZTC operating point","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A stable CMOS current reference based on the ZTC operating point","confLoc":"Giardini Naxos - Taormina, Italy","sourcePdf":"069P43.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077983S","chronDate":"12-15 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7964017","isNumber":"7974086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7964017","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7974086","articleId":"7974160","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7974163,"authors":[{"name":"Aram Baharmast","affiliation":["ITEE Faculty, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Aram","lastName":"Baharmast","id":"37085877426"},{"name":"Juha Kostamovaara","affiliation":["ITEE Faculty, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Juha","lastName":"Kostamovaara","id":"37273978100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6508-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6507-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6509-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7974163","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":545},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Pulse shaping methods","Transistors","Capacitance","Bandwidth","RLC circuits","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["operational amplifiers","optical radar","pulse shaping circuits","radar receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low noise front end transimpedance amplifier channel","pulsed time-of-flight laser range finder receiver","unipolar-to-bipolar pulse shaping","receiver channel","unipolar current pulse","bipolar current","bipolar signal","walk error","TIA channel","input-referred noise current","pulsed time-of-flight laser radar","current 72 nA","frequency 415 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["time-of-flight","trans-impedance amplifier (TIA)","pulse shaping circuit","walk error"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974163","abstract":"A low noise front end trans-impedance amplifier for a pulsed time-of-flight laser range finder receiver is presented.

An extensively wide dynamic range is achieved using the proposed pulse shaping scheme and TIA realization. As the timing point is located at the first zero crossing point of the bipolar signal, the non-idealities of the TIA have little effect on it.

Wearable sensing systems not only provide continuous data monitoring and acquisition, but are also expected to process, and make sense of the acquired data by classification in similar ways as human experts do. Supporting continuous operation on ultra-small batteries poses unique challenges in energy efficiency. In this paper, we present an ultra-low-power bracelet with several sensors that is able to run multi-layer neural networks learning algorithms to process data efficiently. The design combines low-power design, energy efficient algorithms and makes this bracelet suitable for long-term uninterrupted usage with small coin batteries. We demonstrate in-field measurement results that prove that neural networks applications can fit within the mW power and memory envelope of a commercial ARM Cortex M4F microcontroller. We show that a fully connected network of 26 neurons achieve an accuracy of 100% on emotion detection, using only 2% of memory available. Field trials demonstrate that the wearable device can achieve a 2-month lifetime while performing one emotion detection classification every 10 minutes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DeepEmote: Towards multi-layer neural networks in a low power wearable multi-sensors bracelet","publicationTitle":"2017 7th IEEE International Workshop on Advances in Sensors and Interfaces (IWASI)","doi":"10.1109/IWASI.2017.7974208","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 7th IEEE International Workshop on Advances in Sensors and Interfaces (IWASI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7963869/7974188/07974208.pdf","startPage":"32","endPage":"37","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWASI.2017.7974208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974188","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974208","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974208/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"DeepEmote: Towards multi-layer neural networks in a low power wearable multi-sensors bracelet","conferenceDate":"15-16 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7974208/","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17040341","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DeepEmote: Towards multi-layer neural networks in a low power wearable multi-sensors bracelet","confLoc":"Vieste, Italy","sourcePdf":"mayer20.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07296S","chronDate":"15-16 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7963869","isNumber":"7974188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7963869","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7974188","articleId":"7974208","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7974230,"authors":[{"name":"Domenico Balsamo","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Domenico","lastName":"Balsamo","id":"37400516800"},{"name":"Ali Elboreini","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Elboreini","id":"37086010195"},{"name":"Bashir M.

However, their output power is usually unpredictable and highly variable. To mitigate the effect of this variability, systems incorporate large energy buffers, increasing their size, mass and cost. The emerging class of transient computing systems differs from this approach, operating directly from the energy harvesting source and minimizing or removing additional energy storage. Different transient computing approaches have been proposed which enable computation to be sustained despite power outages. However, existing approaches are largely designed for specific applications and architectures, and hence suffer from not being broadly applicable across multiple embedded IoT platforms. To address this challenge, transient approaches need to be integrated within a general IoT programming framework such as ARM's mbed IoT Device Platform. In this paper, we explore how state-of-art transient computing approaches can be integrated into mbed, increasing ease-to-use and deployment across different platforms. This support is offered through libraries and application programming interfaces (APIs) provided by the ARM mbed OS, which enable transient computing to be implemented as a service on top of IoT application protocols. We demonstrate the ability for a transient approach to operate effectively on mbed, by practically implementing it on a low-power NXP microcontroller (MCU) with Flash memory, operating from only 1 mF additional capacitance.","doi":"10.1109/IWASI.2017.7974230","publicationTitle":"2017 7th IEEE International Workshop on Advances in Sensors and Interfaces (IWASI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 7th

Deep convolutional neural networks are being regarded today as an extremely effective and flexible approach for extracting actionable, high-level information from the wealth of raw data produced by a wide variety of sensory data sources. CNNs are however computationally demanding: today they typically run on GPU-accelerated compute servers or high-end embedded platforms. Industry and academia are racing to bring CNN inference (first) and training (next) within ever tighter power envelopes, while at the same time meeting real-time requirements. Recent results, including our PULP and ORIGAMI chips, demonstrate there is plenty of room at the bottom: pj/OP (GOPS/mW) computational efficiency, needed for deploying CNNs in the mobile/wearable scenario, is within reach. However, this is not enough: 1000x energy efficiency improvement, within a mW power envelope and with low-cost CMOS processes, is required for deploying CNNs in the most demanding CPS scenarios. The fj/OP milestone will require heterogeneous (3D) integration with ultra-efficient die-to-die communication, mixed-signal pre-processing, event-based approximate computing, while still meeting real-time requirements.","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","cognitive systems","cyber-physical systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","low-power electronics","neural nets","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["micropower deep learning","cognitive cyber physical systems","deep convolutional neural networks","CNN inference","CNN training","PULP chips","ORIGAMI chips","computational efficiency","mobile appication","wearable appication","low cost CMOS processes","heterogeneous 3D integration","ultraefficient die-to-die communication","mixed-signal prerocessing","event based approximate computing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IWASI.2017.7974239","publicationTitle":"2017 7th IEEE International Workshop on Advances in Sensors and Interfaces (IWASI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 7th IEEE International Workshop on Advances in Sensors and Interfaces (IWASI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7963869/7974188/07974239.pdf","startPage":"165","endPage":"165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWASI.2017.7974239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Plenty of room at the bottom?

However, autonomous navigation algorithms are demanding from the computational standpoint, and it is very challenging to run them on-board of nano-scale UAVs (i.e., few centimeters of diameter) because of the limited capabilities of their MCU-based controllers. This work focuses on the object tracking capability, (i.e., target following capability) on such nano-UAVs. We present a lightweight hardware-software solution, bringing autonomous navigation on a commercial platform using only on-board computational resources. Furthermore, we evaluate a parallel ultra-low-power (PULP) platform that enables the execution of even more sophisticated algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the benefits of our solution, achieving accurate target following using an ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller consuming \u2248 130mW. Our evaluation on a PULP architecture shows the proposed solution running up-to 60 frame-per second in a power envelope of \u2248 30mW leaving more than 70% of the computational resources free for further on-board processing of more complex algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/IWASI.2017.7974242","publicationTitle":"2017 7th IEEE International Workshop on Advances in Sensors and Interfaces (IWASI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 7th IEEE International Workshop on Advances in Sensors and Interfaces (IWASI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7963869/7974188/07974242.pdf","startPage":"170","endPage":"175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWASI.2017.7974242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Target following on nano-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-16 June 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974242/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Target following on nano-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7974242/","accessionNumber":"17040348","publicationDate":"June 2017","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Target following on nano-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","confLoc":"Vieste, Italy","sourcePdf":"palossi54.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083725S","chronDate":"15-16 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7963869","isNumber":"7974188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7963869","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7974188","articleId":"7974242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7974256,"authors":[{"name":"Nicola Lovecchio","affiliation":["Department of dm Information, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Lovecchio","id":"37073030700"},{"name":"Giulia Sacco","affiliation":["Department of dm Information, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Giulia","lastName":"Sacco","id":"37086042958"},{"name":"Giulia Petrucci","affiliation":["Department of dm Information, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Giulia","lastName":"Petrucci","id":"37085387544"},{"name":"Valeria Di Fiore","affiliation":["Department of dm Information, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Valeria","lastName":"Di Fiore","id":"37087065858"},{"name":"Chiara Toti","affiliation":["Department of dm Information, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Chiara","lastName":"Toti","id":"37088825303"},{"name":"Giampiero de Cesare","affiliation":["Department of dm Information, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Giampiero","lastName":"de Cesare","id":"37295967200"},{"name":"Domenico Caputo","affiliation":["Department of dm Information, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Domenico","lastName":"Caputo","id":"37274766700"},{"name":"Marco Nardecchia","affiliation":["School of Aerospace Engineering, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Nardecchia","id":"37085517306"},{"name":"Francesca Costantini","affiliation":["Department of dm Information, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesca","lastName":"Costantini","id":"37085839191"},{"name":"Augusto Nascetti","affiliation":["Department of dm Information, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Augusto","lastName":"Nascetti","id":"37297345300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6707-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6708-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7974256","dbTime":"32 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Glass","Microfluidics","Electrodes","Reservoirs","Substrates","Bonding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dielectric materials","drops","electrodes","etching","glass","hydrophobicity","insulation","microfabrication","microfluidics","photolithography","wetting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low temperature technological process","all-glass microfluidic network","electrowetting on dielectric structure","EWOD structure","wet-etching","electrode","droplet movement","photolithography","hydrophobic film layer","insulation layer","continuous transparent conductive oxide","microfabrication","central chamber","anodic bonding","temperature 330 degC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["microfluidics","electrowetting","digital microfluidic","lab-on-chip","glass wet etching"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a low temperature technological process ahle to integrate an all-glass microfluidic network with an ElectroWetting On Dielectric (EWOD) structure for the digital handling of liquids.

A major advantage of such drone small cells is that the operators can quickly provide cellular services in areas of urgent demand without having to pre-install any infrastructure. Since the base station is attached to the drone, technically it is feasible for the base station to dynamic reposition itself in response to the changing locations of users for reducing the communication distance, decreasing the probability of signal blocking, and ultimately increasing the spectral efficiency. In this paper, we first propose distributed algorithms for autonomous control of drone movements, and then model and analyse the spectral efficiency performance of a drone small cell to shed new light on the fundamental benefits of dynamic repositioning. We show that, with dynamic repositioning, the spectral efficiency of drone small cells can be increased by nearly 100% for realistic drone speed, height, and user traffic model and without incurring any major increase in drone energy consumption.","doi":"10.1109/WoWMoM.2017.7974285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WoWMoM.2017.7974285","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Symposium on A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Symposium on A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7965808/7974270/07974285.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic base station repositioning to improve spectral efficiency of drone small cells","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974285/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 June 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Dynamic base station repositioning to improve spectral efficiency of drone small cells","conferenceDate":"12-15 June 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17028580","htmlLink":"/document/7974285/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic base station repositioning to improve spectral efficiency of drone small cells","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"1A4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111533S","chronDate":"12-15 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7965808","isNumber":"7974270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7965808","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7974270","articleId":"7974285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7974292,"authors":[{"name":"Enas F.

We consider scheduling both on a frame-by-frame basis and also on a slot-by-slot basis. The state transitions are modeled using a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) process and their probabilities are calculated. The state transitions occur at the frame/slot boundaries. Multiple SUs are allocated the same channel on the same time slot as long as there is no interference between them. Such non-interfering sets of SUs is found by considering the expected throughput of each user on all candidate channels. In order to maximize spatial and temporal reuse of channels, the non-interfering sets are assigned to as many channels as possible on maximum possible time slots. Performance of the proposed scheduling schemes is validated using simulations where we measure metrics such as throughput, number of slots allocated, fairness, and blocking probability. We also show the efficacy of the queue-aware scheduling by comparing with one that does not consider the queues.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 June 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974292/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17028566","publicationDate":"June 2017","conferenceDate":"12-15 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7974292/","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Queue-aware opportunistic scheduling in multi-channel dynamic spectrum access networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Queue-aware opportunistic scheduling in multi-channel dynamic spectrum access networks","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"2A3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123726S","chronDate":"12-15 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7965808","isNumber":"7974270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7965808","xplore-issue":"7974270","articleId":"7974292","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7974307,"authors":[{"name":"Chen-Khong Tham","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore"],"firstName":"Chen-Khong","lastName":"Tham","id":"37302074200"},{"name":"Rajarshi Chattopadhyay","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore"],"firstName":"Rajarshi","lastName":"Chattopadhyay","id":"37085996066"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2723-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2724-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7974307","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":619},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks","Wireless communication","Network topology","Sensors","Load management","Distributed databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","gradient methods","minimax techniques","mobile computing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load balancing scheme","mobile edge computing network","distributed computing","min-max optimization problem","wireless channel capacity","link contention constraints","aggregate utility method","convex optimization problem","Lagrangian dual decomposition","gradient descent"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile Edge Computing","Ad-hoc Networks","Distributed Systems","Mobile Computing","Lagrangian Dual Decomposition"]}],"abstract":"The processing time of real-time sensing, data analytics and other applications is an important performance metric. When the application is being executed on a distributed system, the load balancing scheme among processing nodes significantly affects the total processing time of the application. We consider a load balancing scheme for distributed computing at the edge of the network. In the edge model considered, a group of nodes, either mobile or static, with processing and sensing capabilities, are connected to each other over a wireless ad-hoc network. Load balancing among edge nodes is formulated as a min-max optimization problem, with the objective of minimizing the overall processing time of the application while still satisfying the wireless channel capacity and link contention constraints. We use an aggregate utility method to convert the min-max problem into a convex optimization problem. The obtained constrained convex optimization problem is then relaxed with Lagrangian dual decomposition and solved with gradient descent. This form of the formulation can be implemented in a fully distributed manner among the edge nodes, which is consistent with the decentralized nature of edge networks. However, the convergence of this scheme may be slow. We further propose a heuristic algorithm which achieves fast convergence. Our simulation results show that it can give near-optimal performance most of the time.","doi":"10.1109/WoWMoM.2017.7974307","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Symposium on A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Symposium on A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7965808/7974270/07974307.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WoWMoM.2017.7974307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A load balancing scheme for sensing and analytics on a mobile edge computing network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974307","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 June 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974307/","displayDocTitle":"A load balancing scheme for sensing and analytics on a mobile edge computing network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17028535","htmlLink":"/document/7974307/","conferenceDate":"12-15 June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A load balancing scheme for sensing and analytics on a mobile edge computing network","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"4B1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070484S","chronDate":"12-15 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7965808","isNumber":"7974270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7965808","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7974270","articleId":"7974307","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7974313,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Zhou","affiliation":["School of Information and Software Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38667327400"},{"name":"Jiesong Chen","affiliation":["School of Information and Software Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Jiesong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086048819"},{"name":"Xiang Lu","affiliation":["School of Information and Software Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Lu","id":"37086116790"},{"name":"Jia Wu","affiliation":["School of Information and Software Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Wu","id":"38275582100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2723-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2724-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7974313","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Support vector machines","Wireless fidelity","OFDM","Receiving antennas","Clustering algorithms","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["principal component analysis","regression analysis","support vector machines","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CSI fingerprinting","SVM regression","device-free passive localization","WiFi channel state information","support vector machines","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Localization","device-free","Channel State Information(CSI)","Support Vector Machine(SVM)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974313","doi":"10.1109/WoWMoM.2017.7974313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WoWMoM.2017.7974313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974270","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Symposium on A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Symposium on A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7965808/7974270/07974313.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CSI fingerprinting with SVM regression to achieve device-free passive localization","abstract":"Location is an important context on which a broad range of context-aware applications can be built.

This paper proposes a device-free passive localization algorithm based on WiFi Channel State Information(CSI) and Support Vector Machines(SVM). In a physical space covered with WiFi signals, movements of targets may cause observable alteration of CSI. By establishing the nonlinear relationship between CSI fingerprints and target locations through SVM regression, the proposed algorithm is able to estimate the target locations according to the corresponding CSI fingerprints. The algorithm applies Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise(DBSCAN) to reduce the noise in CSI fingerprints, and applies Principal Component Analysis(PCA) to extract the most useful features and reduce the dimension of CSI fingerprints.

In this paper, we present Wi-Chase, a sensorless system based on CSI from ubiquitous WiFi packets for human activity detection. Different from existing schemes utilizing only CSI of one or a small subset of subcarriers, Wi-Chase fully utilizes all available subcarriers of the WiFi signal and incorporates variations in both their phases and magnitudes. As each subcarrier carries integral information that will improve the recognition accuracy because of detailed correlated information content in different subcarriers, we can achieve much higher detection accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first system that gathers information from all the subcarriers to identify and classify multiple activities. Our experimental results show that Wi-Chase is robust and achieves an average classification accuracy greater than 97% for multiple communication links.","doi":"10.1109/WoWMoM.2017.7974315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974270","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","pdfPath":"/iel7/7965808/7974270/07974315.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Symposium on A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Symposium on A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WoWMoM.2017.7974315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wi-chase: A WiFi based human activity recognition system for sensorless environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless fidelity","Feature extraction","Activity recognition","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication links","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Wi-chase","WiFi based human activity recognition system","sensorless environments","human activity detection","multiple communication links"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel state information","Sensorless sensing","Activity recognition","Machine learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Wi-chase: A WiFi based human activity recognition system for sensorless environments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974315/","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7974315/","accessionNumber":"17028507","publicationDate":"June 2017","conferenceDate":"12-15 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wi-chase: A WiFi based human activity recognition system for sensorless environments","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"5B1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066779S","chronDate":"12-15 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7965808","isNumber":"7974270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7965808","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7974270","articleId":"7974315","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7974317,"authors":[{"name":"Pai Chet Ng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Pai Chet","lastName":"Ng","id":"37085854854"},{"name":"Li Zhu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ajou University"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086008227"},{"name":"James She","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"She","id":"37086016908"},{"name":"Rong Ran","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ajou University"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Ran","id":"37086012012"},{"name":"Soochang Park","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Soochang","lastName":"Park","id":"37085874859"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2723-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2724-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7974317","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":280},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reliability","Matching pursuit algorithms","Quality of service","Compressed sensing","Servers","Indexes","Bluetooth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bluetooth","compressed sensing","mobile radio","smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beacon-based proximity detection","compressive sensing","sparse deployment","proximity-based service","Bluetooth Low Energy beacon","smartphone","compressive sampling matching pursuit"]}],"abstract":"A proximity-based service (PBS) leverages the estimated proximity to provide users the accessibility to object or location restricted service.

Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm exhibits better performance than traditional methods while guaranteeing non-interference to PUs.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WoWMoM.2017.7974325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974270","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Symposium on A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7965808/7974270/07974325.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal power allocations for multichannel energy harvesting cognitive radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974325/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7974325/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal power allocations for multichannel energy harvesting cognitive radio","conferenceDate":"12-15 June 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17028550","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal power allocations for multichannel energy harvesting cognitive radio","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"CORAL2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088462S","chronDate":"12-15 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7965808","isNumber":"7974270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7965808","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7974270","articleId":"7974325","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7974328,"authors":[{"name":"Sio-Kei Im","affiliation":["MPI-QMUL Information Systems Research Centre, Macao Polytechnic Institute, Macao, China"],"firstName":"Sio-Kei","lastName":"Im","id":"37067030500"},{"name":"Ka-Hou Chan","affiliation":["MPI-QMUL Information Systems Research Centre, Macao Polytechnic Institute, Macao, China"],"firstName":"Ka-Hou","lastName":"Chan","id":"37085810002"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2723-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2724-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7974328","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Complexity theory","Encoding","Prediction algorithms","Copper","Algorithm design and analysis","Video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","image sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["enhanced sampling algorithm","HEVC","image quality","weighted sampling and adaptive threshold condition","interframe coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive Threshold","High Efficient Video Coding","Inter/Intra Prediction","Weighted Sampling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974328","abstract":"Compared with H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC achieves better image quality at the same coding bit rate, but requires more complexity in its coding process.

A key requirement of these applications is that the drones should be autonomously maneuvered by computer programs. It is therefore important to understand the practical limitations of autonomous drone maneuverability to ensure that target application performance is met. In this paper, we first analyze drone maneuverability using theory to shed light on the tradeoff between the flying speed and the turning agility of the drone. To investigate the practical maneuverability performance, we then emulate as well as fly a commercial drone under the control of an Android program. We reveal some practical maneuverability factors that must be considered for the applications that require frequent changes of direction for the drone.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Drones","Smart phones","Turning","Phantoms","Batteries","Trajectory","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Android (operating system)","autonomous aerial vehicles","control engineering computing","Internet of Things"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous drone maneuverability","Internet of Things","computer programs","Android program"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974336","doi":"10.1109/WoWMoM.2017.7974336","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Symposium on A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7965808/7974270/07974336.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WoWMoM.2017.7974336","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974270","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Symposium on A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding autonomous drone maneuverability for Internet of Things applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Understanding autonomous drone maneuverability for Internet of Things applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974336/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 June 2017","conferenceDate":"12-15 June 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7974336/","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17028509","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding autonomous drone maneuverability for Internet of Things applications","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"IoT2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072954S","chronDate":"12-15 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7965808","isNumber":"7974270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7965808","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7974270","articleId":"7974336","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7974355,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Gharba","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Duesseldorf GmbH, German Research Center, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Gharba","id":"37595051300"},{"name":"Hanwen Cao","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Duesseldorf GmbH, German Research Center, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Hanwen","lastName":"Cao","id":"37086064380"},{"name":"Sandip Gangakhedkar","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Duesseldorf GmbH, German Research Center, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Sandip","lastName":"Gangakhedkar","id":"37086060596"},{"name":"Josef Eichinger","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Duesseldorf GmbH, German Research Center, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Josef","lastName":"Eichinger","id":"37419427900"},{"name":"Ali Ramadan Ali","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Duesseldorf GmbH, German Research Center, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Ali Ramadan","lastName":"Ali","id":"37086061968"},{"name":"Karthikeyan Ganesan","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Duesseldorf GmbH, German Research Center, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Karthikeyan","lastName":"Ganesan","id":"37086096575"},{"name":"Varun Jain","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center (DLR), Institute of Transportation Systems, Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Varun","lastName":"Jain","id":"37086094155"},{"name":"Stephan Lapoehn","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center (DLR), Institute of Transportation Systems, Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Lapoehn","id":"37086100950"},{"name":"Tobias Frankiewicz","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center (DLR), Institute of Transportation Systems, Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Frankiewicz","id":"38229471200"},{"name":"Tobias Hesse","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center (DLR), Institute of Transportation Systems, Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Hesse","id":"37926663800"},{"name":"Yao Zou","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Co.

However, in many actual applications, impulsive moments can not be prescribed ahead of schedule. Hence, in this manuscript, a generalized model of neural networks with delays and impulsive time window is formulated. And then, through the use of lyapunov stability theory method, several original and easy-to-prove sufficient conditions are derived to notarize that the model which concerning the impulsive time window is global exponential stable. Moreover a framework combining the exponential convergence rate with the various parameters of impulsive is constructed. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical results are demonstrated by the numerical simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Feb. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974482/","accessionNumber":"17028593","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7974482/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","conferenceDate":"4-6 Feb. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Exponential stability analysis of delayed neural networks with impulsive time window","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exponential stability analysis of delayed neural networks with impulsive time window","confLoc":"Doha, Qatar","sourcePdf":"paper07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108878S","chronDate":"4-6 Feb. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7965812","isNumber":"7974472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7965812","xplore-issue":"7974472","articleId":"7974482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7974483,"authors":[{"name":"Shyi-Ming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shyi-Ming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277603600"},{"name":"Zhi-Cheng Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Zhi-Cheng","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085789372"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4726-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4727-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7974483","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974483","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","fuzzy set theory","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiattribute decision making method","interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy values","particle swarm optimization","MADM","IVIFV","PSO","attribute values"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IVIFSs","IVIFVs","MADM","PSO techniques"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICACI.2017.7974483","pdfPath":"/iel7/7965812/7974472/07974483.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 Ninth International Conference on Advanced Computational Intelligence (ICACI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Ninth International Conference on Advanced Computational Intelligence (ICACI)","startPage":"43","endPage":"47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACI.2017.7974483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel multiattribute decision making method based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy values and particle swarm optimization techniques","abstract":"A novel multiattribute decision making (MADM) method is proposed in this paper.

Experimental results have shown that when using a swarm to find the optimal solution to a specific natural language processing (NLP) application gradually the velocity vector is decreased towards a very small value that causes the particles to switch from exploration (i.e., the attempt to determine radically new solutions) towards exploitation (search of solutions that are close to those already identified). Based on this observation, a study is carried out to determine whether the velocity vector may be handled in a more efficient manner. An algorithm for reinitializing the velocity of swarm particles is proposed, which improves the exploration of the swarm, by reenergizing particles that have very low velocities. Also, the effect of bounding the initial velocity of particles is studied, to determine whether improved optimization performance can be achieved. The effectiveness of the velocity reinitialisation mechanism is further examined by application to a selection of benchmark test functions. These experimental results are supplemented by relevant statistical tests that indicate a significant improvement in many cases.","doi":"10.1109/ICACI.2017.7974500","publicationTitle":"2017 Ninth International Conference on Advanced Computational Intelligence (ICACI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Ninth International Conference on Advanced Computational Intelligence (ICACI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7965812/7974472/07974500.pdf","startPage":"149","endPage":"156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACI.2017.7974500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modifying the velocity in adaptive PSO to improve optimisation performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974500","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Feb. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974500/","displayDocTitle":"Modifying the velocity in adaptive PSO to improve optimisation performance","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"17028622","htmlLink":"/document/7974500/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modifying the velocity in adaptive PSO to improve optimisation performance","confLoc":"Doha, Qatar","sourcePdf":"paper25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047999S","chronDate":"4-6 Feb. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7965812","isNumber":"7974472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7965812","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7974472","articleId":"7974500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7974518,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Yi Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Yi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37899287100"},{"name":"Shyi-Ming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shyi-Ming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085475636"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4726-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4727-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7974518","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","fuzzy set theory","linear programming","operations research","TOPSIS"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple attribute decision making method","MADM method","interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets","IVIFS","linear programming methodology","TOPSIS method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IVIFSs","linear programming methodology","MADM","TOPSIS"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a multiple attribute decision making (MADM) method using IVIFSs, the linear programming methodology, and the TOPSIS method, where the linear programming methodology is used to obtain optimal weights of attributes.

Researchers have done much work to defend against this kind of attack in traditional networks. The SDN (software defined network) architecture, as a clear indication of future networking architecture, faces the same threat of DNS amplification attack. In this paper, we propose a defense mechanism consisting of three phases. The defense mechanism can easily detect the attacks, protect the victim quickly, then pinpoint all zombies and finally isolate them from the SDN network. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism detects attacks accurately with low consumption, protects victim with quick response and has little impact on normal DNS queries of victim. Besides, after pinpointing and isolating all zombies in the network, the whole network's recovery speed is increased.","doi":"10.1109/ICNIDC.2016.7974530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNIDC.2016.7974530","startPage":"28","endPage":"33","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content (IC-NIDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966451/7974524/07974530.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content (IC-NIDC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A defense mechanism against the DNS amplification attack in SDN","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A defense mechanism against the DNS amplification attack in SDN","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7974530/","accessionNumber":"17028690","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974530/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A defense mechanism against the DNS amplification attack in SDN","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"006077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060321S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7966451","isNumber":"7974524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966451","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7974524","articleId":"7974530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7974536,"authors":[{"name":"Tigang Jiang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic and Science Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Tigang","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37279307500"},{"name":"Honggang Wang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic and Science Technology of China, Chengdu, China","Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Honggang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37405977000"},{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406392100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1246-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1245-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1247-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7974536","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Markov processes","Solid modeling","Analytical models","Cognitive radio","Complexity theory","Two dimensional displays","Ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","Markov processes","numerical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","ad hoc cognitive radio networks","3D Markov analytical model","2D Markov analytical model","numerical analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio networks","spectrum access","channel allocation","ad hoc networks"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the 3-D Markov analytical model for cognitive radio networks of [1] are replaced by out proposed new 2-D Markov analytical model with considerable low complexity to evaluate the performance of Ad-Hoc Cognitive Radio Networks, and the theory mistakes of [1] are corrected.

Despite the importance of metadata in the file system, the overhead of maintaining the metadata cannot be taken lightly. It is because the metadata also have to be persisted on the storage device and it consumes IO bandwidth as well as creates journaling overhead. In this paper, we find that the random write with synchronous performance of a storage is significantly affected by not only the hardware performance but also timer interrupt interval of the kernel. Extending the timer interrupt interval allows reducing the write volume and increasing the random write followed by fsync() performance of EXT4 file system. We propose intermittent mtime timestamp update on Coarse grain mtime interval instead of Fine grain mtime interval. The experiment results with mtime update interval of 1 second show that the total write volume is decreased by 75% and 28%, respectively compared to total write volume of 1 ms and 10 ms mtime interval, and the throughput increased 3.1\u00d7 and 1.2\u00d7 compared to 1 ms and 10 ms mtime interval. Coarse grain mtime update is resolve to the journaling overhead issues while still logging mtime timestamp.","doi":"10.1109/ICNIDC.2016.7974543","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content (IC-NIDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content (IC-NIDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966451/7974524/07974543.pdf","startPage":"99","endPage":"102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNIDC.2016.7974543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of timer interrupt interval on file system synchronization overhead","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974543/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Effect of timer interrupt interval on file system synchronization overhead","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7974543/","accessionNumber":"17028723","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of timer interrupt interval on file system synchronization overhead","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"019099.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031801S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7966451","isNumber":"7974524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966451","xplore-issue":"7974524","articleId":"7974543","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":7974552,"authors":[{"name":"Tianwei Hou","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory, Ministry of Education Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tianwei","lastName":"Hou","id":"37086086202"},{"name":"Xiaodong Ji","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory, Ministry of Education Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Ji","id":"37590162400"},{"name":"Zexu Li","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory, Ministry of Education Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zexu","lastName":"Li","id":"37085684366"},{"name":"Yong Li","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory, Ministry of Education Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Li","id":"37085378283"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1246-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1245-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1247-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7974552","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":215},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Throughput","Signal to noise ratio","Fading channels","Cognitive radio","Closed-form solutions","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","Nakagami channels","probability","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative spectrum sensing method","nontime-slotted full duplex cognitive radio networks","nontime-slotted FD-CRN","self-interference channel","Nakagami-m fading channel","closed-form expressions","false alarm probabilities","secondary user throughput improvement","unlicensed user throughput improvement","SU throughput improvement","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative spectrum sensing for non-time-slotted full-duplex cognitive radio networks","doi":"10.1109/ICNIDC.2016.7974552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974524","endPage":"144","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content (IC-NIDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content (IC-NIDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966451/7974524/07974552.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNIDC.2016.7974552","startPage":"139","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974552","abstract":"A new cooperative spectrum sensing method for non-time-slotted full duplex cognitive radio networks (FD-CRNs) is proposed in this paper, with the self-interference channel considered as Nakagami-m fading channel, which is more practical compared with commonly used Rayleigh and Rice channel.

It is a significant challenge to resolve the contradiction between resource-hungry applications and resource-constrained mobile devices. As a promising approach to address such a challenge, computation offloading enables mobile users to offload computation to nearby resource-rich cloud infrastructure to reduce energy consumption and improve performance. In this paper, we formulate the computation offloading decision making problem as a MEC server selection problem, considering how to find one proper MEC server for one user that carrying computation job. We propose a joint computation and communication resource allocation model. In this model, we consider both transmitting energy consumption and communication delay as communication cost in a multi-user and multi-MEC server scenario. We use two algorithms to solve the proposed model. One is Hungarian algorithm based MEC server selection algorithm, but it ignores the fairness of the system. Another is Fairness based MEC server selection algorithm, which incorporate the fairness of the system. Finally, we show the numerical simulation result.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974557/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"17028689","htmlLink":"/document/7974557/","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Joint computation and communication resource allocation in mobile-edge cloud computing networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint computation and communication resource allocation in mobile-edge cloud computing networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"033042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110298S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7966451","isNumber":"7974524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966451","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7974524","articleId":"7974557","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7974571,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Guo","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Science and Technology on Information Transmission and Dissemination in Communication Networks Laboratory"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Guo","id":"37086074898"},{"name":"Kai Niu","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Science and Technology on Information Transmission and Dissemination in Communication Networks Laboratory"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Niu","id":"37284274700"},{"name":"Chao Dong","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Science and Technology on Information Transmission and Dissemination in Communication Networks Laboratory"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Dong","id":"37067914600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1246-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1245-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1247-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7974571","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974571","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Base stations","Array signal processing","Minimization","Downlink","Mean square error methods","Iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","interference (signal)","iterative methods","mean square error methods","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative beamforming scheme","leakage sum rate maximization criterion","downlink multiuser channels","weighted sum rate maximization method","LSR","leakage interference","leakage sum-rate maximization","power budget constraint","optimization problem","weighted mean-square error minimization","WMMSE","iterative algorithm","weighted factors","receive beamformers","transmit beamformers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Leakage sum-rate (LSR)","Beamforming","Iterative algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICNIDC.2016.7974571","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content (IC-NIDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content (IC-NIDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966451/7974524/07974571.pdf","startPage":"234","endPage":"238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNIDC.2016.7974571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An iterative beamforming scheme based on leakage sum-rate maximization criterion","abstract":"In this paper, we study an iterative beamforming scheme for downlink multiuser channels. The sum-rate of the system can be maximized by weighted sum-rate maximization method. However, the interference of leakage signal is not considered in this method. We propose a new metric named leakage sum-rate (LSR) to treat leakage interference. Then, the leakage sum-rate maximization is modeled by the power budget constraint of base stations. The optimization problem can be transformed to an equivalent weighted mean-square error minimization (WMMSE) problem and an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve it. In the algorithm, weighted factors, transmit and receive beamformers are updated iteratively. The proposed algorithm outperforms the SLNR maximizing algorithm in terms of the system sum-rate. Compared with the weighted sum-rate maximization scheme, the proposed algorithm can converge to a stationary point more quickly although the system performance is lower. Simulation results illustrate that the algorithm can make a good balance between system performance and complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974571/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17028761","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7974571/","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An iterative beamforming scheme based on leakage sum-rate maximization criterion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An iterative beamforming scheme based on leakage sum-rate maximization criterion","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"047092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053917S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7966451","isNumber":"7974524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966451","xplore-issue":"7974524","articleId":"7974571","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7974573,"authors":[{"name":"Jinnian Zhang","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Jinnian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086074644"},{"name":"Yan Li","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Li","id":"37086068277"},{"name":"Kai Niu","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Science and Technology on Information Transmission and Dissemination in Communication Networks Laboratory"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Niu","id":"37085449810"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1246-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1245-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1247-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7974573","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":264},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","channel estimation","compressed sensing","frequency division multiplexing","interference suppression","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative channel estimation algorithm","compressive sensing","GFDM","generalized frequency division multiplexing","cellular system","fifth generation PHY layer","pulse shaping","precoding matrices","interference cancellation","orthogonal match pursuit recovery algorithm","Cramer-Rao bound"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GFDM","Compressive sensing","Iterative channel estimation","Cramer-Rao bound","Iterative interference cancellation"]}],"abstract":"Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM) is a promising solution for the cellular system of the fifth generation (5G) PHY layer because its flexibility can address the different application requirements. However, due to the pulse shaping, there is inherent interference existing in the received signal, which has a negative impact on pilot-based channel estimation. Although the interference on the pilot symbols can be eliminated at the transmitter by using precoding matrices, the accompanied transmitting power penalty increases with the non-orthogonality of subcarriers and subsymbols. In our work, we propose an iterative method for interference cancellation at the receiver, which can efficiently mitigate the effect of neighboring symbols on pilots without transmitting power penalty. In addition, to improve the accuracy of channel estimation, we adopt the compressive sensing (CS) technology. Simulation results show that our proposed channel estimation algorithm is efficient even when the interference is severe, and by using orthogonal match pursuit (OMP) recovery algorithm, the performance of our algorithm can be close to the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB).","doi":"10.1109/ICNIDC.2016.7974573","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content (IC-NIDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content (IC-NIDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966451/7974524/07974573.pdf","startPage":"244","endPage":"248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNIDC.2016.7974573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative channel estimation algorithm based on compressive sensing for GFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974573","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974573/","displayDocTitle":"Iterative channel estimation algorithm based on compressive sensing for GFDM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"17028708","htmlLink":"/document/7974573/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative channel estimation algorithm based on compressive sensing for GFDM","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"049106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090957S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7966451","isNumber":"7974524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966451","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7974524","articleId":"7974573","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7974576,"authors":[{"name":"Bowen Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bowen","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085824273"},{"name":"Heli Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Heli","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086163407"},{"name":"Hong Ji","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Ji","id":"37272809900"},{"name":"Victor C.

With the number of users increasing, the traditional ZF algorithm does not work effectively due to the fact that the channel matrix cannot provide sufficient dimensions to isolate interference. In this paper, we propose a Coordinated Zero-Forcing Beamforming with Clustering(CZFC) scheme to improve the defects of traditional ZF algorithm. Firstly, users are partitioned into clusters according to clustering rule that inter-cluster interference can almost be neglected, then CZF is applied to each cluster, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can significantly increase system capacity, and at the same time, the proposed algorithm has low complexity. In most cases, it will be able to converge after three iterations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNIDC.2016.7974589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974524","startPage":"322","endPage":"326","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content (IC-NIDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966451/7974524/07974589.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clusteringfor coordinated zero-forcing beamformingin multi-user interference networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974589/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7974589/","displayDocTitle":"Clusteringfor coordinated zero-forcing beamformingin multi-user interference networks","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"17028763","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clusteringfor coordinated zero-forcing beamformingin multi-user interference networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"065061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059753S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7966451","isNumber":"7974524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966451","xplore-issue":"7974524","articleId":"7974589","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7974591,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Chen","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education of PRC Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085907197"},{"name":"Huiyang Peng","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education of PRC Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huiyang","lastName":"Peng","id":"37086081426"},{"name":"Mengyue Liu","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education of PRC Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Mengyue","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086077516"},{"name":"Yu Liu","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education of PRC Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086032327"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1246-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1245-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1247-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7974591","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":225},"abstract":"Frequency Hopping Communication Signal (FHCS) is widely used in military filed especially in military communication for its good anti-jamming performance and multiple access capability. Due to the rapid development of communication technology, the band width of FHCS become wider and wider, frequency become larger and larger. There will be a huge pressure on Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) as well as DSP device. Theory of compressed sensing (CS) enables a successful reconstruction of sparse signal by sampling at a sub-Nyquist sample rate. Analog to Information Converter is a better implementation of CS, which includes Random Demodulator scheme (RD) and Modulated Wideband Converter (MWC). In this paper, we apply these two schemes into FHCS's compressed sampling and reconstruction. Simulations are performed to verify that RD scheme can reconstruct signal successfully with high possibility with relatively low time complexity at low sample rate. Besides, MWC guarantees the accuracy and efficiency of signal collection.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content (IC-NIDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966451/7974524/07974591.pdf","startPage":"332","endPage":"336","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content (IC-NIDC)","doi":"10.1109/ICNIDC.2016.7974591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNIDC.2016.7974591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974524","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing for frequency hopping communication signals via analog to information converter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sparse matrices","Frequency shift keying","Dictionaries","Matching pursuit algorithms","Spread spectrum communication","Military communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","frequency hop communication","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","analog to information converter","frequency hopping communication signal","military communication","anti-jamming performance","multiple access","analog to digital converter","ADC","DSP device","sparse signal reconstruction","sub-Nyquist sample rate","random demodulator scheme","modulated wideband converter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency hopping communication signal","Compressed sensing","Analog-to-information","Random demodulator","Modulated wideband converter","Over complete dictionary"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing for frequency hopping communication signals via analog to information converter","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7974591/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"17028735","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing for frequency hopping communication signals via analog to information converter","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"067067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045053S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7966451","isNumber":"7974524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966451","xplore-issue":"7974524","articleId":"7974591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7974593,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Liu","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086008700"},{"name":"Chao Dong","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Dong","id":"37067914600"},{"name":"Zhiqiang He","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiqiang","lastName":"He","id":"37291355100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1246-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1245-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1247-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7974593","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a block iterative frequency domain decision feedback equalizer with noise prediction (NP-BI) for single-carrier (SC) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) relay systems.

We show that our approach using word embeddings as input features for our model can learn better mention and relation representation and is superior to state-of-the-art results.","doi":"10.1109/ICNIDC.2016.7974612","startPage":"437","endPage":"441","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content (IC-NIDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966451/7974524/07974612.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content (IC-NIDC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNIDC.2016.7974612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning mention and relation representation with convolutional neural networks for relation extraction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Urban areas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","learning (artificial intelligence)","natural language processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mention representation","relation representation","convolutional neural networks","relation extraction","sentence-level features","part of speech","named entity","dependency tree path properties","pairwise ranking loss function","mention embeddings","relation embeddings","word embeddings","learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Relation extraction","Convolutional neural networks","Representation learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974612/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Learning mention and relation representation with convolutional neural networks for relation extraction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7974612/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"17028729","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning mention and relation representation with convolutional neural networks for relation extraction","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"088050.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065192S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7966451","isNumber":"7974524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966451","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7974524","articleId":"7974612","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7974712,"authors":[{"name":"Ehud Weiss","affiliation":["Unit of Electrooptics, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheba, Israel"],"firstName":"Ehud","lastName":"Weiss","id":"37085813200"},{"name":"Dima Bykhovsky","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Shamoon College of Engineering, Beersheba, Israel","Unit of Electrooptics, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheba, Israel"],"firstName":"Dima","lastName":"Bykhovsky","orcid":"0000-0003-4468-7791","id":"37594033200"},{"name":"Shlomi Arnon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheba, Israel"],"firstName":"Shlomi","lastName":"Arnon","orcid":"0000-0001-8048-3089","id":"37271167400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"7974712","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellite communication","Amplitude shift keying","Error analysis","High-speed optical techniques","Optical communication equipment"]}],"abstract":"The following two corrections for \n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref1\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">[1]</xref>\n are provided: \n<list list-type=\"bullet\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><list-item><label>\u2022</label><p>The corrected <xref ref-type=\"disp-formula\" rid=\"deqn17\">Eq.

Our emphasis is on multi-user gain that refers to the advantage of allowing multi-user transmission in massive MIMO. Such a gain can potentially offer tens or even hundreds of times of rate increase. The main difficulty in achieving multi-user gain is the reliance on accurate channel state information (CSI) in the existing schemes. With accurate CSI, both OMA and NOMA can deliver performance not far away from capacity. Without accurate CSI, however, most of the existing schemes do not work well. We outline a solution to this difficulty based on IDMA and iterative data-aided channel estimation (DACE). This scheme can offer very high throughput and is robust against the pilot contamination problem. The receiver cost is low, since only maximum ratio combining (MRC) is involved and there is no matrix inversion or decomposition. Under time division duplex, accurate CSI acquired in the up-link can be used to support low-cost down-link solutions, such as zero forcing. These findings offer useful design considerations for future systems.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2725919","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2725919","startPage":"14728","endPage":"14748","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07974726.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Massive MIMO, Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Interleave Division Multiple Access","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974726/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Massive MIMO, Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Interleave Division Multiple Access","volume":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2017","accessionNumber":"17124369","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","htmlLink":"/document/7974726/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501123"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008081","fundingName":"Open Research Fund of the National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University","grantNumber":"2015D06"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001839","fundingName":"University Grants Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China","grantNumber":"AoE/E-02/08, CityU 11208114, CityU 11217515 and CityU 11280216"},{"fundingName":"European Union through ICT projects","grantNumber":"ICT-217033 WHERE and ICT-248894 WHERE2"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Massive MIMO, Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Interleave Division Multiple Access","sourcePdf":"access-hu-2725919-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.262413S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7974726","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7974727,"authors":[{"name":"Junjie Ma","affiliation":["Department of Statistics, Columbia University, New York City, NY, USA","Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/8225762/7974727/ma-2726019-small.gif","p":["Junjie Ma received the B.E. degree from Xidian University, China, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree from the City University of Hong Kong in 2015.

We investigate two pilot structures-orthogonal pilot (OP) and superimposed pilot (SP). In OP, pilots occupy dedicated time (or frequency) slots, while in SP, pilots are superimposed with data. We study an iterative data-aided channel estimation (IDACE) receiver, where partially decoded data are used to refine channel estimation. We analyze the achievable rates for systems with IDACE receivers for both OP and SP. We show that the optimal portion of pilot power tends to zero for SP with Gaussian signaling. This result is consistent with existing findings obtained via the replica method in statistical physics. The latter involves multiple codes, which is convenient for theoretical analysis but difficult to implement. As a comparison, IDACE is potentially implementable in practice. We demonstrate that, with code optimization, SP can outperform OP in a high mobility environment with a large number of users. We provide numerical examples to verify our analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974727/","volume":"35","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7974727/","accessionNumber":"17431668","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On Orthogonal and Superimposed Pilot Schemes in Massive MIMO NOMA Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"University Grants Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China","grantNumber":"AoE/E-02/08, CityU 11208114, CityU 11217515 and CityU 11280216"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Orthogonal and Superimposed Pilot Schemes in Massive MIMO NOMA Systems","sourcePdf":"jsac-liang-2726019-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114412S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"8225762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"8225762","articleId":"7974727","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7974729,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyu Zhou","affiliation":["Beijing Engineering Research Center of High-speed Railway Broadband Mobile Communications, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7974729/zhou-2723438-small.gif","p":["Xiaoyu Zhou is currently pursuing the bachelor\u2019s degree with the School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, China.

Specifically, we formulate a tag selection scheme and design the corresponding detection method.

The superiority of MIMO-NOMA over MIMO-OMA in terms of both sum channel capacity and ergodic sum capacity is proved analytically. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the more users are admitted to a cluster, the lower is the achieved sum rate, which illustrates the tradeoff between the sum rate and maximum number of admitted users. On this basis, a user admission scheme is proposed, which is optimal in terms of both sum rate and the number of admitted users when the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio thresholds of the users are equal. When these thresholds are different, the proposed scheme still achieves good performance in balancing both criteria. Moreover, under certain conditions, it maximizes the number of admitted users. In addition, the complexity of the proposed scheme is linear in the number of users per cluster. Simulation results verify the superiority of MIMO-NOMA over MIMO-OMA in terms of both sum rate and user fairness, as well as the effectiveness of the proposed user admission scheme.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2017.2725879","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2017.2725879","startPage":"2413","endPage":"2424","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/8038094/07974731.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038094","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity Comparison Between MIMO-NOMA and MIMO-OMA With Multiple Users in a Cluster","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/49/8038094/7974731-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974731/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Capacity Comparison Between MIMO-NOMA and MIMO-OMA With Multiple Users in a Cluster","volume":"35","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17171292","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7974731/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada through its Discovery program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1420575 and CNS-1456793"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Capacity Comparison Between MIMO-NOMA and MIMO-OMA With Multiple Users in a Cluster","sourcePdf":"jsac-dobre-2725879-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11526S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"8038094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"8038094","articleId":"7974731","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7974732,"authors":[{"name":"Ran Zhang","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Graduate School, Research Institute @ NTU, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ran","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086083569"},{"name":"Wen-De Zhong","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Wen-De","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37279780200"},{"name":"Qian Kemao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Kemao","id":"37298666600"},{"name":"Sheng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086165610"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0655"},{"format":"CD","value":"1943-0647"}],"articleNumber":"7974732","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1730},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"","type":"graphic","fileSize":"1.90 MB","file":"/ielx7/4563994/7953746/7974732/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2722474.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/4563994/7953746/7974732/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2722474.jpg"},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["LED lamps","Cameras","Receivers","Sensors","Image processing","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["free-space optical communication","image sensors","indoor navigation","integrated optics","integrated optoelectronics","LED lamps","optical receivers","optical transmitters","smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single LED positioning system","circle projection","visible light positioning system","VLP","circular LED lamp","point marker","transmitter","smartphone camera","LED image","geometric features","receiver orientation","receiver location","mobile indoor environment","centimeter-level positioning accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Visible light communication (VLC)","visible light positioning (VLP)","light emitting diode (LED)","image sensor."]}],"abstract":"A simple and efficient visible light positioning (VLP) system based on a single LED lamp is proposed and demonstrated.

Such applications require low latency and high reliability, and thus, we exploit non-orthogonal multiple access to reduce the access latency and to improve the packet reception probability. In the proposed two-fold scheme, the BS performs semi-persistent scheduling and allocates time-frequency resources in a nonorthogonal manner while the vehicles autonomously perform distributed power control with iterative signaling control. We formulate the centralized scheduling and resource allocation problem as equivalent to a multi-dimensional stable roommate matching problem, in which the users and time/frequency resources are considered as disjoint sets of objects to be matched with each other. We then develop a novel rotation matching algorithm, which converges to an L-rotation stable matching after a limited number of iterations. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the traditional orthogonal multiple access scheme in terms of the access latency and reliability.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2017.2726018","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2017.2726018","startPage":"2383","endPage":"2397","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/8038094/07974737.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038094","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access for High-Reliable and Low-Latency V2X Communications in 5G Systems","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/49/8038094/7974737-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974737/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access for High-Reliable and Low-Latency V2X Communications in 5G Systems","volume":"35","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17171296","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7974737/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National 973 Project","grantNumber":"2013CB336700"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1301255 and 61625101"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP150104019"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1405116 and 1443894"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access for High-Reliable and Low-Latency V2X Communications in 5G Systems","sourcePdf":"jsac-di-2726018-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136117S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"8038094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"8038094","articleId":"7974737","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7974739,"authors":[{"name":"Van-Dinh Nguyen","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Soongsil University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/8225762/7974739/nguye-2726007-small.gif","p":["Van-Dinh Nguyen (S\u201914) received the B.S. degree in telecommunications from the Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, Vietnam, in 2012, and the M.S. degree in electronic engineering from Soongsil University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2015, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering.

A major part of the power budget must be allocated to serve these users in guaranteeing their quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, hampering QoS for other users, and thus compromising the system reliability. In non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), the message intended for a user with a poor channel condition is decoded by itself and by another user with a better channel condition. The message intended for the latter is then successively decoded by itself after canceling the interference of the former. The overall information throughput is thus improved by this particular successive decoding and interference cancellation. This paper aims to design linear precoders/beamformers for signal superposition at the base stations of NOMA multiple-input multiple-output multi-cellular systems to maximize the overall sum throughput subject to the users' QoS requirements, which are imposed independently on the users' channel conditions. This design problem is formulated as the maximization of a highly nonlinear and nonsmooth function subject to nonconvex constraints, which is very computationally challenging. Path-following algorithms for its solution, which invoke only a simple convex problem of moderate dimension at each iteration, are developed. Generating a sequence of improved points, these algorithms converge at least to a local optimum. Extensive numerical simulations are then provided to demonstrate their merit.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2017.2726007","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/8225762/07974739.pdf","startPage":"2681","endPage":"2695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8225762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2017.2726007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precoder Design for Signal Superposition in MIMO-NOMA Multicell Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974739","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/49/8225762/7974739-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Precoder Design for Signal Superposition in MIMO-NOMA Multicell Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974739/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17431658","htmlLink":"/document/7974739/","volume":"35","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Institute for Information & Communications Technology Promotion"},{"fundingName":"Korean government (MSIT) (2017-0-00724, Development of Beyond 5G Mobile Communication Technologies (Ultra-Reliable, Low-Latency, and Massive Connectivity) and Combined Access Technologies for Cellular-based Industrial Automation Systems)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council\u2019s Discovery Projects","grantNumber":"DP130104617"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000287","fundingName":"U.K. Royal Academy of Engineering Research Fellowship","grantNumber":"RF1415/14/22"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/P019374/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1420575 and CNS-1456793"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Precoder Design for Signal Superposition in MIMO-NOMA Multicell Networks","sourcePdf":"jsac-nguyen-2726007-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168086S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"8225762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"8225762","articleId":"7974739","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7974741,"authors":[{"name":"Haiyan Fan","affiliation":["National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/8063257/7974741/fan-2714338-small.gif","p":["Haiyan Fan received the B.S. degree in information engineering in\n 2011 and the Master's degree in information and communication engineering in January 2013 from the National\n University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China, where since February 2013, she has been working toward the Ph.D.\n degree in graph and image processing.","Her research interests include statistical signal processing, tensor analysis, and machine learning."]},"firstName":"Haiyan","lastName":"Fan","orcid":"0000-0002-2136-4853","id":"37086110427"},{"name":"Yunjin Chen","affiliation":["ULSee Inc., Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/8063257/7974741/chen-2714338-small.gif","p":["Yunjin Chen received the B.Sc. degree in applied physics from Nanjing\n University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, the M.Sc. degree in optical engineering from the National\n University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Graz University of\n Technology, Graz, Austria, in 2007, 2010, and 2015, respectively.","From July 2015 to April 2017, he was a Scientific Researcher in the Government of China.

In this paper, a mixture of Gaussian noise and sparse noise is considered. The sparse noise includes stripes, impulse noise, and dead pixels. The denoising task is formulated as a low-rank tensor recovery (LRTR) problem from Gaussian noise and sparse noise. Traditional low-rank tensor decomposition methods are generally NP-hard to compute. Besides, these tensor decomposition based methods are sensitive to sparse noise. In contrast, the proposed LRTR method can preserve the global structure of HSIs and simultaneously remove Gaussian noise and sparse noise.The proposed method is based on a new tensor singular value decomposition and tensor nuclear norm. The NP-hard tensor recovery task is well accomplished by polynomial time algorithms. The convergence of the algorithm and the parameter settings are also described in detail. Preliminary numerical experiments have demonstrated that the proposed method is effective for low-rank tensor recovery from Gaussian noise and sparse noise. Experimental results also show that the proposed LRTR method outperforms other denoising algorithms on real corrupted hyperspectral data.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974741","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tensile stress","Noise reduction","Gaussian noise","Hyperspectral imaging","Fans","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian noise","hyperspectral imaging","image denoising","image restoration","singular value decomposition","tensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tensor nuclear norm","NP-hard tensor recovery task","Gaussian noise","sparse noise","LRTR method","impulse noise","low-rank tensor recovery problem","low-rank tensor decomposition methods","tensor decomposition based methods","tensor singular value decomposition","hyperspectral image denoising","HSI denoising","hyperspectral image restoration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM)","gaussian noise","low-rank tensor","recovery","sparse noise","tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD)"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/8063257/07974741.pdf","startPage":"4589","endPage":"4604","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8063257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2714338","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2714338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperspectral Image Restoration Using Low-Rank Tensor Recovery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974741/","displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral Image Restoration Using Low-Rank Tensor Recovery","isDynamicHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17216618","htmlLink":"/document/7974741/","volume":"10","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral Image Restoration Using Low-Rank Tensor Recovery","sourcePdf":"jstars-fan-2714338-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153392S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"8063257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"8063257","articleId":"7974741","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7974749,"authors":[{"name":"Bichai Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/8038094/7974749/bwang-2725878-small.gif","p":["Bichai Wang (S\u201915) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2015, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electronic Engineering.

However, the fundamental limit of existing beamspace MIMO is that the number of supported users cannot be larger than the number of RF chains at the same time-frequency resources. To break this fundamental limit, in this paper, we propose a new spectrum and energy-efficient mmWave transmission scheme that integrates the concept of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with beamspace MIMO, i.e., beamspace MIMO-NOMA. By using NOMA in beamspace MIMO systems, the number of supported users can be larger than the number of RF chains at the same time-frequency resources. In particular, the achievable sum rate of the proposed beamspace MIMO-NOMA in a typical mmWave channel model is analyzed, which shows an obvious performance gain compared with the existing beamspace MIMO. Then, a precoding scheme based on the principle of zero forcing is designed to reduce the inter-beam interferences in the beamspace MIMO-NOMA system. Furthermore, to maximize the achievable sum rate, a dynamic power allocation is proposed by solving the joint power optimization problem, which not only includes the intra-beam power optimization, but also considers the inter-beam power optimization. Finally, an iterative optimization algorithm with low complexity is developed to realize the dynamic power allocation. Simulation results show that the proposed beamspace MIMO-NOMA can achieve higher spectrum and energy efficiency compared with the existing beamspace MIMO.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2017.2725878","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2017.2725878","startPage":"2370","endPage":"2382","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/8038094/07974749.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038094","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum and Energy-Efficient Beamspace MIMO-NOMA for Millimeter-Wave Communications Using Lens Antenna Array","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974749/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum and Energy-Efficient Beamspace MIMO-NOMA for Millimeter-Wave Communications Using Lens Antenna Array","volume":"35","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17171287","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7974749/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329203"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571267 and 61571270"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000287","fundingName":"Royal Academy of Engineering through the U.K.\u2013China Industry Academia Partnership Programme Scheme","grantNumber":"UK-CIAPP\\49"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum and Energy-Efficient Beamspace MIMO-NOMA for Millimeter-Wave Communications Using Lens Antenna Array","sourcePdf":"jsac-dai-2725878-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141926S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"8038094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"150","xplore-issue":"8038094","articleId":"7974749","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7974755,"authors":[{"name":"Yujie Wang","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/8006334/7974755/wang-2725938-small.gif","p":["Yujie Wang received the B.S. degree from the School of Astronautics, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2010, and the M.S. degree from the School of Mechatronics and Automation, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China, in 2012, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

A classifier based on the primal support vector machine is trained to detect the sky area, and the random sample consensus algorithm is used to choose the inliers among the sky area. The sun vector is built upon the valid measurements. The attitude angles (Roll and Pitch) from the inertial navigation system (INS) are used to establish the Zenith direction when the platform tilts during traveling. The results show that the PL-compass can provide accurate heading angle (RMSE = 1.58\u00b0) by seeing only a tiny part of the skylight (minimum of 0.028%) in the dynamic vehicle test. The PL-compass is also integrated with the visual INS based on the indirect extended Kalman filter to improve the navigation accuracy. Each time a new measurement becomes available, the states estimated by the INS are used to check the consistency of the innovation and reject the outliers. The results show that the position errors of the integrated navigation system are greatly reduced with the help of the PL-compass. The estimated trajectory tracks the ground truth very well. The position error is 25.9 m (1.03% of the distance traveled) with heading errors less than 1\u00b0 in the experiment.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/8006334/07974755.pdf","startPage":"5646","endPage":"5653","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2017.2725938","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2017.2725938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8006334","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974755","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polarized Light Compass-Aided Visual-Inertial Navigation Under Foliage Environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Compass","Sensors","Inertial navigation","Sun","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["area measurement","compasses","computerised instrumentation","inertial navigation","Kalman filters","light polarisation","nonlinear filters","optical sensors","random processes","support vector machines","vegetation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polarized light compass-aided visual-inertial navigation system","foliage environment","heading information extraction","sky light polarization pattern","PL-compass","occlusion","support vector machine","sky area detection","random sample consensus algorithm","INS","Zenith direction","dynamic vehicle testing","indirect extended Kalman filter","trajectory track estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Polarized light compass","support vector machine (SVM)","visual odometry (VO)","integrated navigation","extended Kalman filter (EKF)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974755/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.1, 1 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Polarized Light Compass-Aided Visual-Inertial Navigation Under Foliage Environment","volume":"17","issue":"17","htmlLink":"/document/7974755/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Sept.1, 2017","accessionNumber":"17099045","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61573371 and 61503403"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polarized Light Compass-Aided Visual-Inertial Navigation Under Foliage Environment","sourcePdf":"jsen-wang-2725938-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.193178S","chronDate":"Sept.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"8006334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8006334","articleId":"7974755","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7974762,"authors":[{"name":"Sa Xiao","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8062938/7974762/xiao-2723399-small.gif","p":["Sa Xiao received the B.S.E, M.S.E, and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2009, 2012, and 2017, respectively.

By using the Lagrangian dual method, we decompose the original optimization problem into a primal problem and a dual problem. We adopt the concave-convex procedure to transform the non-convex primal problem into a tractable form through sequential convex approximations and then utilize the sub-gradient method to solve the dual problem.

When CUs transmit to CBS, Es may overhear the confidential transmissions from CUs. In the aforementioned system, all CUs are considered to be equipped with energy harvesters to collect energy from their surrounding environments. Meanwhile, the transmit power of CUs shall be limited by a tolerable interference temperature to guarantee the quality-of-service of a primary user. In order to improve the physical-layer security of energy-harvesting CR systems, we propose an Energy-AwaRe mulTiuser scHeduling (EARTH) scheme, which takes into account both the interference temperature constraint and residual energy level harvested from the ambient surroundings. We consider the use of security-reliability tradeoff (SRT) as a metric to evaluate the performance of proposed EARTH scheme. To be specific, we derive closed-form expressions of outage probability (OP) and intercept probability (IP) for the proposed scheme over Rayleigh fading channels. For the purpose of comparison, the SRT analysis of round-robin scheduling (RRS) and conventional multiuser scheduling (CMUS) methods is also carried out. Numerical results show that the SRT of proposed EARTH scheme is better than that of RRS and CMUS methods, demonstrating the advantage of our proposed scheme against eavesdropping attacks. Additionally, it is illustrated that the sum of IP and OP can be minimized for RRS and CMUS as well as EARTH schemes through a time allocation between the energy harvesting and information transmission phases.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2725989","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8318405/07974766.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8318405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2725989","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"2084","endPage":"2096","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Aware Multiuser Scheduling for Physical-Layer Security in Energy-Harvesting Underlay Cognitive Radio Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974766","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Aware Multiuser Scheduling for Physical-Layer Security in Energy-Harvesting Underlay Cognitive Radio Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974766/","volume":"67","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7974766/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17633236","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61302104, 61401223, 61522109, 61631020, 61671253 and 91738201"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20140887 and BK20150040"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Research of Higher Education Institutions of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"15KJA510003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Aware Multiuser Scheduling for Physical-Layer Security in Energy-Harvesting Underlay Cognitive Radio Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-zou-2725989-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14299S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8318405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8318405","articleId":"7974766","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7974768,"authors":[{"name":"Yunjie Gu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8248674/7974768/gu-2711267-small.gif","p":["Yunjie Gu (S\u201914) received the B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in\n Electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2010 and 2015, respectively.","From 2015 to 2016, he was a Research Consultant in the General Electric Global Research Center, Shanghai, China.

The conventional model-order reduction for a multiple-timescale system is based on discarding states with fast (short timescale) dynamics. It has been successfully applied to synchronous machines, but is inaccurate when applied to power converters because the timescales of fast and slow states are not sufficiently separated. In the method proposed here, several fast states are at first discarded but a representation of their interaction with the slow states is added back. Recognizing that the fast states of many converters are linear allows well-developed linear system theories to be used to implement this concept. All the information of the original system relevant to system-wide dynamics, including nonlinearity, is preserved, which facilitates judgments on system stability and insight into control design. The method is tested on a converter-supplied mini power system and the comparison of analytical and experiment results confirms high preciseness in a broad range of conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974768/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","volume":"33","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"17485728","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","publicationDate":"April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7974768/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-Order Models for Representing Converters in Power System Studies","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EPSRC Project Resilient Hybrid Technology for High-Value Microgrids (RHYTHM)","grantNumber":"EP/N034570/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Reduced-Order Models for Representing Converters in Power System Studies","sourcePdf":"tpel-gu-2711267-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075615S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8248674","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"8248674","articleId":"7974768","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7974769,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Network, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0002-3690-7902","id":"37402742300"},{"name":"Marco Moretti","affiliation":["University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Moretti","orcid":"0000-0002-3822-0995","id":"37302219500"},{"name":"Xiaodong Wang","affiliation":["Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0003-3744-2139","id":"37281375000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"7974769","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":486},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Precoding","MIMO","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Complexity theory","Diversity reception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TH-VP precoding","multiuser MIMO","vector perturbation","nonlinear precoding technique","near-capacity performance","multiuser multiple-input multiple-output systems","optimum perturbation vector","hybrid Tomlinson-Harashima VP","novel zero-forcing precoding scheme","interuser interference","nonlinear techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-user MIMO","vector perturbation","tomlinson-Harashima precoding"]}],"abstract":"Vector perturbation (VP) is a nonlinear precoding technique that achieves near-capacity performance in multiuser multiple-input multiple-output systems at the expense of large complexity due to the search for the optimum perturbation vector.

The performance of TH-VP is analyzed and simulation results show that TH-VP outperforms conventional zero-forcing VP and approaches the performance of dirty paper coding.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2725915","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8207705/07974769.pdf","startPage":"11399","endPage":"11403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2725915","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8207705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid TH-VP Precoding for Multiuser MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974769","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974769/","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid TH-VP Precoding for Multiuser MIMO","volume":"66","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416526","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7974769/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid TH-VP Precoding for Multiuser MIMO","sourcePdf":"tvt-moretti-2725915-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063821S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8207705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8207705","articleId":"7974769","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7974771,"authors":[{"name":"Li Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8207705/7974771/chen-2726003-small.gif","p":["Li Chen received the B.E. in electrical and information engineering\n from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2009 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from\n the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2014.

A popular approach for analyzing stochastic WPCN is to model the location of different nodes according to a homogeneous Poisson point process. However, it is more reasonable to place user equipments (UEs) around a power beacon considering the inefficiency and difficulty of wireless energy transfer. This motivates us to model the location of UEs as a cluster point process (CPP). With practical transmission range considered, the truncated Matern CPP and Thomas CPP are proposed. The performances of coverage probability and the average received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio are derived. Then, we optimize the time allocation fraction to maximize the average network throughput by pseudo-convexity optimization, and the closed-form optimal results are presented.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2726003","startPage":"11286","endPage":"11294","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8207705/07974771.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2726003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8207705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic Wireless Powered Communication Networks With Truncated Cluster Point Process","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy exchange","Wireless sensor networks","Wireless communication","Throughput","Interference","Stochastic processes","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","probability","stochastic processes","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic wireless powered communication networks","truncated cluster point process","time allocation fraction","pseudo-convexity optimization","coverage probability","average network throughput","average received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","Thomas CPP","truncated Matern CPP","wireless energy transfer","power beacon","homogeneous Poisson point process","stochastic WPCN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cluster point process (CPP)","wireless powered communication","network throughput"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974771/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Wireless Powered Communication Networks With Truncated Cluster Point Process","volume":"66","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7974771/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17416482","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Program on Key Basic Research Project of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329205"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601432"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Wireless Powered Communication Networks With Truncated Cluster Point Process","sourcePdf":"tvt-chen-2726003-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081642S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8207705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8207705","articleId":"7974771","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7974772,"authors":[{"name":"Na Deng","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8110747/7974772/deng-2725827-small.gif","p":["Na Deng received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2010 and 2015, respectively.

In this paper, we provide a fine-grained performance analysis of the mm-wave D2D communication networks. Specifically, we first establish a general and tractable framework to investigate the performance of mm-wave D2D networks using the Poisson bipolar model integrated with several features of the mm-wave band. To show what fraction of users in the network achieve target reliability if the required signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) (or QoS requirement) is given, we derive the meta distributions of the SINR and the data rate. Interestingly, in mm-wave D2D networks, the standard beta approximation for the meta distribution does not work very well when highly directional antenna arrays are used or the node density is small. To resolve this issue, we provide a modified approximation by using higher moments of the conditional SINR distribution, which is shown to be closer to the exact result. On this basis, we also derive the mean local delay and spatial outage capacity to provide a comprehensive investigation on the impact of mm-wave features on the performance of D2D communication.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2725827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8110747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2725827","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8110747/07974772.pdf","startPage":"4940","endPage":"4954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fine-Grained Analysis of Millimeter-Wave Device-to-Device Networks","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/26/8110747/7974772-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Fine-Grained Analysis of Millimeter-Wave Device-to-Device Networks","volume":"65","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7974772/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17372569","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974772/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"(DUT16RC(3)119)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"US NSF","grantNumber":"CCF 1525904"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"A Fine-Grained Analysis of Millimeter-Wave Device-to-Device Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-deng-2725827-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108766S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8110747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"8110747","articleId":"7974772","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7974773,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Rong Zhou","affiliation":["British Telecommunications, Ipswich, U.K."],"firstName":"Yu Rong","lastName":"Zhou","orcid":"0000-0001-7547-9552","id":"37273638700"},{"name":"Kevin Smith","affiliation":["British Telecommunications, Ipswich, U.K."],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Smith","id":"37347990800"},{"name":"Paul Weir","affiliation":["British Telecommunications, Ipswich, U.K."],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Weir","id":"37085844521"},{"name":"Mike Gilson","affiliation":["British Telecommunications, Ipswich, U.K."],"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"Gilson","id":"37693668100"},{"name":"Jingxin Chen","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies, Ipswich, U.K."],"firstName":"Jingxin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085510998"},{"name":"Weiwei Pan","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies, Ipswich, U.K."],"firstName":"Weiwei","lastName":"Pan","id":"37085843287"},{"name":"Youhui Chang","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies, Ipswich, U.K."],"firstName":"Youhui","lastName":"Chang","id":"37086099441"},{"name":"Shuangyuan Wu","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies, Ipswich, U.K."],"firstName":"Shuangyuan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086094609"},{"name":"Shipeng Wu","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies, Ipswich, U.K."],"firstName":"Shipeng","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085837071"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"7974773","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":381},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fibers","Adaptive optics","Fiber nonlinear optics","Optical crosstalk","Optical fiber communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fibre networks","optical modulation","optical receivers","optical transmitters","quadrature amplitude modulation","quadrature phase shift keying","transponders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field trial","single-carrier ultraefficient superchannel","real-time coherent 400G single-carrier superchannel","production grade 64GBaud DP-16QAM optical transponders","error-free performance","multiple mixed modulation format 200G single-carrier superchannels","DP-8QAM","DP-QPSK","conventional 40G optical channels","conventional 100G optical channels","spectral efficiency","standard grid","optical fiber nonlinearity","optical performance","maximum capacity","optical fiber transmission","bit rate 1.2 Tbit/s","distance 250 km","frequency 50 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical communication","networks","coherent communication","optical fiber nonlinearity","modulation formats"]}],"abstract":"We report the first successful field trial of real-time coherent 400G single-carrier superchannel of 1.2Tb/s over distances up to 250 km using production grade 64GBaud DP - 16QAM optical transponders.

This paper proposes a real-time event-triggered adaptive critic controller for generating near optimal control actions to achieve desired temperatures. The desired temperatures may have variable or fixed values over time. The real-time controller is designed in two phases. Initially event-triggered control actions are generated by linear quadratic regulator for small period while the actor-critic network of controller is trained. Later, adaptive critic controller takes over for event-based actions. Hence, the event triggering conditions for both general linear and nonlinear discrete time systems using Lyapunov stability analysis are derived in this paper. The event-based actor-critic network weight update formulation and ultimate boundedness of parameters are also presented in this paper. The proposed approach has been validated for different and common temperature sets for four zones, where the control execution events are minimized to 20% and 26%, respectively.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8246762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2017.2725899","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8246762/07974781.pdf","startPage":"178","endPage":"188","doi":"10.1109/TII.2017.2725899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Critic-Based Event-Triggered Control for HVAC System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Critic-Based Event-Triggered Control for HVAC System","volume":"14","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7974781/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17485858","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974781/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Critic-Based Event-Triggered Control for HVAC System","sourcePdf":"tii-dhar-2725899-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.169026S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8246762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"8246762","articleId":"7974781","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":7974787,"authors":[{"name":"Na Zhao","affiliation":["School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"p":["Na Zhao received the B.E. and M.S. degrees in computer science from\n the Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China, in 2010 and 2015, respectively, and is currently working toward the\n Ph.D. degree at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore.","Her research interests include multimedia content analysis, user analysis on social media and computer vision."]},"firstName":"Na","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086056817"},{"name":"Hanwang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"p":["Hanwang Zhang received the B.Eng.

Based on the observation that the frame sequence encodes the temporal dynamics of a video (e.g., object movement and event evolution), we treat the frame sequential order as a self-supervision to learn video representations. Unlike other unsupervised video feature learning methods based on frame-level feature reconstruction that is sensitive to visual variance, VideoWhisper is driven by a novel video \u201csequence-to-whisper\u201d learning strategy. Specifically, for each video sequence, we use a prelearned visual dictionary to generate a sequence of high-level semantics, dubbed \u201cwhisper,\u201d which can be considered as the language describing the video dynamics. In this way, we model VideoWhisper as an end-to-end sequence-to-sequence learning model using attention-based recurrent neural networks. This model is trained to predict the whisper sequence and hence it is able to learn the temporal structure of videos. We propose two ways to generate video representation from the model. Through extensive experiments on two real-world video datasets, we demonstrate that video representation learned by V ideoWhisper is effective to boost fundamental multimedia applications such as video retrieval and event classification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974787/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17099711","volume":"19","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7974787/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"VideoWhisper: Toward Discriminative Unsupervised Video Feature Learning With Attention-Based Recurrent Neural Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001381","fundingName":"National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore"},{"fundingName":"IRC@SG Funding Initiative"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VideoWhisper: Toward Discriminative Unsupervised Video Feature Learning With Attention-Based Recurrent Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tmm-hong-2722687-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099203S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"8010475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8010475","articleId":"7974787","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7974789,"authors":[{"name":"Changyue Song","affiliation":["Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering College of Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Changyue Song received the B.S. degree in industrial engineering from\n Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2012 and the M.S. degree in management science and engineering from Peking\n University, Beijing, China, in 2015.

As each of the sensor signals often contains partial and dependent information, data-level fusion techniques have been developed that aim to construct a health index via the combination of multiple sensor signals. While the existing data-level fusion approaches have shown a promise for degradation modeling and prognostics, they are limited by only considering a linear fusion function. Such a linear assumption is usually insufficient to accurately characterize the complicated relations between multiple sensor signals and the underlying degradation process in practice, especially for complex engineering systems considered in this study. To address this issue, this study fills the literature gap by integrating kernel methods into the data-level fusion approaches to construct a health index for better characterizing the degradation process of the system. Through selecting a proper kernel function, the nonlinear relation between multiple sensor signals and the underlying degradation process can be captured. As a result, the constructed health index is expected to perform better in prognosis than existing data-level fusion methods that are based on the linear assumption. In fact, the existing data-level fusion models turn out to be only a special case of the proposed method. A case study based on the degradation signals of aircraft gas turbine engines is conducted and finally shows the developed health index by using the proposed method is insensitive for missing data and leads to an improved prognostic performance.","doi":"10.1109/TR.2017.2715180","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel7/24/8370165/07974789.pdf","startPage":"640","endPage":"650","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.2017.2715180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8370165","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integration of Data-Level Fusion Model and Kernel Methods for Degradation Modeling and Prognostic Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974789","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/24/8370165/7974789-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974789/","displayDocTitle":"Integration of Data-Level Fusion Model and Kernel Methods for Degradation Modeling and Prognostic Analysis","volume":"67","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17801467","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7974789/","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CMMI-1435809"},{"fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-17-1-2261"},{"fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"71201002, 71471005 and 71571003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Integration of Data-Level Fusion Model and Kernel Methods for Degradation Modeling and Prognostic Analysis","sourcePdf":"tr-zhang-2715180-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12113S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"24","isNumber":"8370165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8370165","articleId":"7974789","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":7974792,"authors":[{"name":"Shan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8207705/7974792/szhan-2724547-small.gif","p":["Shan Zhang (M\u201916) received the Ph.D. degree in the Department\n of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University,\u00a0Beijing, China, and the B.S. degree in the Department of\n Information, Beijing Institute Technology, Beijing, China, in 2016 and 2011, respectively.

Specifically, we consider two-tier HetNets with hierarchical caching, where the most popular files are cached at small cell base stations (SBSs) while the less popular ones are cached at macro base stations (MBSs). For a given network cache deployment budget, the cache sizes for MBSs and SBSs are optimized to maximize network capacity while satisfying the file transmission rate requirements. As cache sizes of MBSs and SBSs affect the traffic load distribution, inter-tier traffic steering is also employed for load balancing. Based on stochastic geometry analysis, the optimal cache sizes for MBSs and SBSs are obtained, which are threshold based with respect to cache budget in the networks constrained by SBS backhauls. Simulation results are provided to evaluate the proposed schemes and demonstrate the applications in cost-effective network deployment.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2724547","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8207705/07974792.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2724547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8207705","startPage":"11264","endPage":"11276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost-Effective Cache Deployment in Mobile Heterogeneous Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974792","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cost-Effective Cache Deployment in Mobile Heterogeneous Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974792/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416497","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7974792/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-Effective Cache Deployment in Mobile Heterogeneous Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhang-2724547-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10821S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8207705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"8207705","articleId":"7974792","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7974796,"authors":[{"name":"Sayan Basu Roy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Sayan Basu","lastName":"Roy","orcid":"0000-0002-2537-2957","id":"37086042705"},{"name":"Shubhendu Bhasin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Shubhendu","lastName":"Bhasin","id":"37392052500"},{"name":"Indra Narayan Kar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Indra Narayan","lastName":"Kar","orcid":"0000-0003-0277-1725","id":"37271158000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"7974796","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1273},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Linear systems","MIMO","Adaptation models","Adaptive control","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","control system synthesis","linear systems","matrix algebra","MIMO systems","model reference adaptive control systems","parameter estimation","robust control","time-varying systems","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combined model reference adaptive controller","unknown multiinput multioutput LTI systems","guaranteed parameter convergence","online plant-parameter identification method","direct control-parameter update law","exponential convergence","tunable finite time","control-parameter estimation errors","classical MRAC approaches","plant-parameter estimation law","time invariant systems","unknown MIMO LTI systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MRAC","parameter convergence","PE"]}],"abstract":"This work proposes a novel combined model reference adaptive controller (MRAC) for unknown multi input multi output (MIMO) LTI systems with guaranteed parameter convergence. An online plant-parameter identification method is developed in conjunction with a direct control-parameter update law to ensure exponential convergence (after a tunable finite time) of tracking error as well as plant and control-parameter estimation errors to zero. Unlike the restrictive persistence of excitation (PE) condition required in classical MRAC approaches, this method guarantees parameter convergence by imposing a significantly milder initial excitation condition on the relevant signals. The introduction of a low-pass filter obviates the need for state derivative knowledge, whereas, the novel inclusion of an integral-like update in the plant-parameter estimation law overcomes the requirement of the restrictive PE condition. As far as the authors are aware, this is the first work on MRAC for MIMO linear time invariant (LTI) systems, which guarantees exponential convergence of the error dynamics without requiring the PE condition as well as the structural knowledge of the system matrices.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined MRAC for Unknown MIMO LTI Systems With Parameter Convergence","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2017.2725955","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/9/8240827/07974796.pdf","startPage":"283","endPage":"290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2017.2725955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8240827","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974796","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974796/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Combined MRAC for Unknown MIMO LTI Systems With Parameter Convergence","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7974796/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17482701","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined MRAC for Unknown MIMO LTI Systems With Parameter Convergence","sourcePdf":"tac-basuroy-2725955-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09414S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"8240827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8240827","articleId":"7974796","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7974802,"authors":[{"name":"Zana Ghaderi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/8176066/7974802/ghade-2725952-small.gif","p":["Zana\u00a0Ghaderi (S) received the BSc degree from the University of\n Science and Technology, Tehran, and the MSc degree from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2008 and\n 2012, respectively, both in computer engineering, and the PhD degree from the Department of Computer Science,\n University of California, Irvine, in 2017.

This leads to a higher Soft-Error-Rate (SER), lower reliability, and lower SRAMs' stability in FPGAs. SNM partially improves by leveraging the recovery phase of BTI through flipping SRAM content. We propose STABLE, a three-step post-synthesis stress-aware technique, in order to reduce the impact of BTI-induced SNM reduction in FPGA Look-up-Tables (LUTs) using the SAT-based Boolean Matching (BM) algorithm. STABLE partitions Data-Flow-Graph (DFG) of the implemented design into different cones. First, the SAT-based BM algorithm finds a new configuration for each cone while their functionalities are preserved and all SRAMs are flipped. Second, cones that did not pass the first step can benefit from unused SRAMs in their partially-used LUTs for storing the flipped configurations of such LUTs. Finally, flipped configurations of fully-used LUTs are stored in the closest unused LUTs. The main configuration of the implemented FPGA design is swapped by the new flipped configuration, periodically. Our extensive experimental analysis demonstrates 69 and 70 percent on average improvements in the SNM reduction (DSNM) and the SER increase (DSER), respectively. Since the proposed methodology is deployed after the FPGA placement and routing of the application, the overhead is negligible.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"STABLE: Stress-Aware Boolean Matching to Mitigate BTI-Induced SNM Reduction in SRAM-Based FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/TC.2017.2725952","startPage":"102","endPage":"114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2017.2725952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8176066","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/8176066/07974802.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974802","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974802/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 1 2018","displayDocTitle":"STABLE: Stress-Aware Boolean Matching to Mitigate BTI-Induced SNM Reduction in SRAM-Based FPGAs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"67","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7974802/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17541291","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"STABLE: Stress-Aware Boolean Matching to Mitigate BTI-Induced SNM Reduction in SRAM-Based FPGAs","sourcePdf":"tc-ghaderi-2725952-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149223S","chronDate":"Jan. 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"8176066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8176066","articleId":"7974802","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7974805,"authors":[{"name":"Mandar N.

In particular, we focus on heuristic implementations of static and dynamic time division duplexing (TDD) for access links with synchronized or unsynchronized access-backhaul (SAB or UAB) time splits. We propose PPP approximations to characterize the distribution of the new types of interference encountered with dynamic TDD and UAB. These schemes offer better resource utilization than static TDD and SAB, however, potentially higher interference makes their choice non-trivial and the offered gains sensitive to different network parameters, including UL/DL traffic asymmetry, user load per BS or number of slave BSs per master BS. One can harness notable gains from UAB and/or dynamic TDD only if backhaul links are designed to have much larger throughput than the access links.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2723887","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8062938/07974805.pdf","startPage":"6460","endPage":"6478","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2723887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8062938","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Dynamic and Static TDD in Self-Backhauled Millimeter Wave Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974805","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974805/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Dynamic and Static TDD in Self-Backhauled Millimeter Wave Cellular Networks","volume":"16","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17225658","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7974805/","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004356","fundingName":"Nokia"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Dynamic and Static TDD in Self-Backhauled Millimeter Wave Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-kulkarni-2723887-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111302S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8062938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"8062938","articleId":"7974805","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7974806,"authors":[{"name":"Ruixue Hu","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8062938/7974806/hu-2724036-small.gif","p":["Ruixue Hu (S\u201915) received the B.Eng. degree in communication engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China, in 2012.

Simulations show that our proposed algorithms outperform the compared schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2724036","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8062938/07974806.pdf","startPage":"6503","endPage":"6513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2724036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8062938","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pareto Optimality for the Single-Stream Transmission in Multiuser Relay Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974806","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974806/","displayDocTitle":"Pareto Optimality for the Single-Stream Transmission in Multiuser Relay Networks","volume":"16","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17225662","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7974806/","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"General Research Fund from the Research Grants Council, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region","grantNumber":"CUHK 14203616"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pareto Optimality for the Single-Stream Transmission in Multiuser Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-hu-2724036-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085396S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8062938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8062938","articleId":"7974806","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7974807,"authors":[{"name":"Jingon Joung","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jingon","lastName":"Joung","orcid":"0000-0002-9551-1123","id":"37289977300"},{"name":"Jihoon Choi","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Korea Aerospace University, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jihoon","lastName":"Choi","id":"37086219250"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"7974807","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":278},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"In this paper, an amplify-and-forward two-way relay (TWR) precoding is designed with no source node (SN) processing in order to maximize sum rate and concurrently reduce the network latency and signaling overhead. For the arbitrary pre-/postprocessing at the SNs that have N antennas, it is rigorously shown that an N-by-N optimal TWR precoder matrix is symmetric when the noise power of the TWR node is relatively small compared with that of the SNs and/or each of the channel matrices is spatially orthogonal. Using the symmetric structure of the TWR precoding matrix, a constrained nonlinear-multivariable optimization problem is formulated that can be solved with polynomial time complexity. Furthermore, a closed-form optimal TWR precoding matrix is designed for a TWR system with N = 2. When compared with an optimal joint SN and RN precoding method, it is verified that the proposed precoding method provides a good tradeoff between the system complexity and sum rate performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8103982/07974807.pdf","startPage":"10526","endPage":"10531","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2725998","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2725998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8103982","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear Precoder Design for an AF Two-Way MIMO Relay Node with No Source Node Precoding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Precoding","Antennas","Symmetric matrices","Relays","MIMO","Optimization","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","computational complexity","linear codes","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","optimisation","polynomials","precoding","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symmetric structure","nonlinear-multivariable optimization problem","closed-form optimal TWR precoding matrix","linear precoder design","AF two-way MIMO relay node","N-by-N optimal TWR precoder matrix","amplify-and-forward two-way relay precoding","network latency","signaling overhead","channel matrices","polynomial time complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplify-and-forward relay","precoding","two-way relay (TWR)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974807/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Linear Precoder Design for an AF Two-Way MIMO Relay Node with No Source Node Precoding","volume":"66","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7974807/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17372493","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007431","fundingName":"NRF"},{"fundingName":"Korean Government","grantNumber":"2016R1D1A1B03930250 and 2016R1A2B4013418"},{"fundingName":"MSIP, Korea"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008122","fundingName":"ITRC","grantNumber":"IITP-2017-2012-0-00559"},{"fundingName":"IITP"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002635","fundingName":"Inha University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Precoder Design for an AF Two-Way MIMO Relay Node with No Source Node Precoding","sourcePdf":"tvt-joung-2725998-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089029S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8103982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8103982","articleId":"7974807","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7974808,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Raza","affiliation":["Departament d\u2019Enginyeria El\u00e8ctrica, Centre d\u2019Innovaci\u00f3 Tecnol\u00f2gica en Convertidors Est\u00e0tics i Accionaments, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/8322364/7974808/raza-2725982-small.gif","p":["Muhammad Raza received his Bachelor of Engineering degree from\n Institute of Industrial Electronics Engineering, Karachi Pakistan, in 2004, and he got his Master of Science degree\n from Brandenburg Technical University, Cottbus Germany, in 2010.

In such a network, each offshore VSC-HVDC converter operates in grid-forming mode. In this paper, the offshore VSC grid-forming control is enhanced by using a frequency and voltage droop scheme in order to establish a coordinated grid control among the offshore converters. A small-signal model of the offshore ac network is developed that includes the high-voltage alternating current cables' model, the converters' current, and voltage-control model, the frequency droop scheme, and the voltage droop scheme. Based on this model, an eigenvalue analysis is performed in order to study the influence of the frequency and voltage droop gains on overall offshore ac network stability.

The Hamilton's principle is applied to obtain a distributed parameter system of the suspension cable system which includes one partial differential equation and two ordinary differential equations. Two nonlinear disturbance observers are developed to compensate the effect of boundary disturbances. The auxiliary systems are designed to eliminate the effects of input nonlinearities. Based on the designed disturbance observer and auxiliary systems, two boundary controllers are designed at the top and bottom boundaries of the suspension cable. Under the proposed controllers, the amplitude of oscillation is proven to be uniformly ultimately bounded and converges to a small neighborhood of zero by selecting proper design parameters of the antidisturbance control scheme for the suspension cable system. Meanwhile, some sufficient conditions are provided to guarantee the effectiveness of the developed control law. Finally, simulation results show that the controllers developed in this paper work well in handling disturbances for the suspension cable system of helicopter.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/8536932/07974811.pdf","startPage":"2292","endPage":"2304","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2017.2710638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2017.2710638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8536932","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antidisturbance Control for a Suspension Cable System of Helicopter Subject to Input Nonlinearities","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Suspensions","Helicopters","Payloads","Observers","Adaptive systems","Vibrations","Actuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cables (mechanical)","control nonlinearities","distributed parameter systems","helicopters","nonlinear control systems","observers","partial differential equations","suspensions (mechanical components)","vehicle dynamics","vibration control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["input nonlinearities","auxiliary systems","distributed parameter system","nonlinear disturbance observers","antidisturbance control","suspension cable system","helicopter","vibration suppression","Hamilton's principle","partial differential equation","ordinary differential equation","boundary disturbances","boundary controllers","sufficient conditions","control law"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antidisturbance control","boundary controller","disturbance observer","input nonlinearities","suspension cable system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974811/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Antidisturbance Control for a Suspension Cable System of Helicopter Subject to Input Nonlinearities","volume":"48","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7974811/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18235481","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61573184 and 61533008"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004750","fundingName":"Aeronautical Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"20165752049"},{"fundingName":"Six Talents Peak Project of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"2012-XXRJ-010"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"NE2016101"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antidisturbance Control for a Suspension Cable System of Helicopter Subject to Input Nonlinearities","sourcePdf":"tsmc-chen-2710638-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145225S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"8536932","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8536932","articleId":"7974811","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7974815,"authors":[{"name":"Kui Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Power System, Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8299601/7974815/wang-2726009-small.gif","p":["Kui Wang (M\u201911) was born in Hubei, China, in 1984.

The critical issue of this converter is that two flying capacitor voltages of each phase and two neutral-point potentials of the dc-link need to be balanced. This paper presents a decoupled voltage balancing method for this 5L-HC converter based on modified phase-shifted pulse width modulation (PS-PWM) and optimal zero-sequence voltage injection. The voltages across the central dc-link capacitor and two flying capacitors are balanced first by adjusting the width of four PWM signals. Second, the relationship between the neutral-point currents and the output phase voltage is studied and the upper and lower dc-link capacitor voltages are balanced by zero-sequence voltage injection. Both steady-state and dynamic-state simulation and experimental results are presented to confirm the validity of this method.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Topology","Switches","Medium voltage","Voltage control","Electric potential","Pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power capacitors","PWM power convertors","switching convertors","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-performance medium-voltage high-power conversions","flying capacitor voltages","neutral-point potentials","decoupled voltage balancing method","5L-HC converter","neutral-point currents","output phase voltage","dc-link capacitor voltages","dc-link","five-level hybrid-clamped converter","modified phase-shifted pulse width modulation","optimal zero-sequence voltage injection","PWM signals","steady-state simulation","dynamic-state simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacitor voltage balancing","medium-voltage drive","multilevel converter","phase-shifted pulse width modulation (PS-PWM)","zero-sequence voltage (ZSV)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2017.2726009","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8299601/07974815.pdf","startPage":"4690","endPage":"4702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8299601","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2017.2726009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Topology and Control of a Five-Level Hybrid-Clamped Converter for Medium-Voltage High-Power Conversions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974815","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Topology and Control of a Five-Level Hybrid-Clamped Converter for Medium-Voltage High-Power Conversions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974815/","volume":"33","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7974815/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17596377","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51407101"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topology and Control of a Five-Level Hybrid-Clamped Converter for Medium-Voltage High-Power Conversions","sourcePdf":"tpel-wang-2726009-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110606S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8299601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8299601","articleId":"7974815","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7974817,"authors":[{"name":"Shanshan Jin","affiliation":["Power Electronics and Electrical Drives Research Center, Shenzhen Graduate School of Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8281552/7974817/jin-2724920-small.gif","p":["Shanshan Jin was born in Anhui, China, in 1989.

However, most of the existing high-power solar array simulators (SASs) are designed for simulating energy sources in terrestrial applications, and may not have suitable dynamic performance for nonterrestrial applications. This paper proposes a design for a high-power high-dynamic-performance space solar array simulator (SSAS) system, which combines a linear power stage unit and a multilevel bus tracking converter unit, in order to achieve a fast step-switching capability and high-power-handling capacity. In this paper, we consider the SSAS power system as two separate parts: the I-V power curve simulator that uses a linear power stage with 20 linear voltage-controlled current paths in parallel; and the multilevel bus tracking converter unit that provides the variable voltage levels tracking the SSAS output voltage, in order to decrease the power dissipation in the linear power stage. This paper establishes a mathematical model for the multilevel converter under this particular system architecture, and presents the application qualification conditions and system design principles. The proposed 2.4-kW SSAS can react quickly to a load step between the short-circuit and open-circuit states, which are the most challenging working conditions, at a stepping frequency of 3 kHz; this is a superior dynamic performance compared to other similar devices. The experimental results of testing the spacecraft power supply with a shunt regulator architecture demonstrating better performance, when compared to the results from four SAS modular products in parallel.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2017.2724920","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","startPage":"4102","endPage":"4114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2017.2724920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8281552","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8281552/07974817.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space vehicles","Power system dynamics","Voltage control","Satellites","Testing","Regulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial satellites","power supply circuits","solar cell arrays","switching convertors","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-power high-dynamic-performance space solar array simulator","linear power stage unit","multilevel bus tracking converter unit","fast step-switching capability","high-power-handling capacity","SSAS power system","I-V power curve simulator","power dissipation","application qualification conditions","system design principles","spacecraft power supply","step-wave tracking output voltage","high-orbit satellites","frequency 3.0 kHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High-dynamic performance","I\u2013V curve","linear power stage","multilevel tracking converter","solar array simulator (SAS)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"High-Power High-Dynamic-Performance Space Solar Array Simulator Using Step-Wave Tracking Output Voltage Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974817/","volume":"33","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7974817/","accessionNumber":"17574856","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Basic Research Project from State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence, PRC","grantNumber":"JSZL2015603B004"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Science and Technology Plan","grantNumber":"JSGG20150529114007828"},{"fundingName":"National Defense Basic Research","grantNumber":"JCK2016203B053"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Power High-Dynamic-Performance Space Solar Array Simulator Using Step-Wave Tracking Output Voltage Approach","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhang-2724920-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077544S","chronDate":"May  2018","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8281552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8281552","articleId":"7974817","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7974822,"authors":[{"name":"Gaofei Tang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Gaofei","lastName":"Tang","orcid":"0000-0002-1051-588X","id":"37085706696"},{"name":"Alex M.

Apart from guiding the probe to the correct location, it can be equally difficult for a non-expert to identify relevant structures within the image. Automatic image processing can provide tools to help experienced as well as inexperienced operators with these tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on convolutional neural networks, which can automatically detect 13 fetal standard views in freehand 2-D ultrasound data as well as provide a localization of the fetal structures via a bounding box. An important contribution is that the network learns to localize the target anatomy using weak supervision based on image-level labels only. The network architecture is designed to operate in real-time while providing optimal output for the localization task. We present results for real-time annotation, retrospective frame retrieval from saved videos, and localization on a very large and challenging dataset consisting of images and video recordings of full clinical anomaly screenings. We found that the proposed method achieved an average F1-score of 0.798 in a realistic classification experiment modeling real-time detection, and obtained a 90.09% accuracy for retrospective frame retrieval.

Essentially, data are modulated and transferred via high-frequency electric field generated by the parasitic capacitances of the coupling coils and the metal shield plates, while power is transferred through relatively low-frequency magnetic field generated by the coupling coils. Coupling structure and operation principle are illustrated and analyzed. Besides, the signal to noisy ratio performance is studied and optimized. With the proposed method, a 40 W prototype is built and the data transmission rate reaches 230 kbps. Experimental results have verified that the proposed method is valid and has the advantages of good flexibility and large spatial position offset redundancy. Because the method does not do any modification on the main circuit of the WPT system, it also has advantages of low cost and easy to implement.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8299601","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2017.2725990","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8299601/07974825.pdf","startPage":"4980","endPage":"4991","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2017.2725990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Inductive and Capacitive Combined Parallel Transmission of Power and Data for Wireless Power Transfer Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","displayDocTitle":"An Inductive and Capacitive Combined Parallel Transmission of Power and Data for Wireless Power Transfer Systems","volume":"33","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7974825/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17596341","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974825/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51377183, 51477020, and 61573074"},{"fundingName":"Chongqing International Science and Technology Cooperation Base Project","grantNumber":"CSTC2015GJHZ40001"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"106112016CDJXZ178801"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Inductive and Capacitive Combined Parallel Transmission of Power and Data for Wireless Power Transfer Systems","sourcePdf":"tpel-tang-2725990-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08571S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8299601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"8299601","articleId":"7974825","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":7974828,"authors":[{"name":"Jin He","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, P.R.

In order to protect network security for these businesses in cloud computing, nowadays, a number of middleboxes are deployed at front-end of cloud computing or parts of middleboxes are deployed in cloud computing. However, the former is leading to high cost and management complexity, and also lacking of network security protection between virtual machines while the latter does not effectively prevent network attacks from external traffic. To address the above-mentioned challenges, we introduce a novel customized network security for cloud service (CNS), which not only prevents attacks from external and internal traffic to ensure network security of services in cloud computing, but also affords customized network security service for cloud users. CNS is implemented by modifying the Xen hypervisor and proved by various experiments which showing the proposed solution can be directly applied to the extensive practical promotion in cloud computing.","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2017.2725828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9215209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2017.2725828","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4629386/9215209/07974828.pdf","startPage":"801","endPage":"814","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Customized Network Security for Cloud Service","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Customized Network Security for Cloud Service","volume":"13","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1 2020","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2020","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7974828/","publicationDate":"1 Sept.-Oct. 2020","accessionNumber":"20023080","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974828/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"JSPS KAKENHI","grantNumber":"JP16K00117 and JP15K15976"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011923","fundingName":"KDDI Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Customized Network Security for Cloud Service","sourcePdf":"tsc-ota-2725828-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168764S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"9215209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9215209","articleId":"7974828","onlineDate":"11 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7974862,"authors":[{"name":"Zixing Zhang","affiliation":["University of Passau, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["\nZixing Zhang (zixing.zhang@uni-passau.de) received his B.S. degree from the Chinese Agricultural University in 2007, his M.S. degree from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, in 2010, and his Ph.D. degree from the Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany, in 2015.

While there is great interest in migrating to fully automated, self-driving vehicles, factors such as technology performance, cost barriers, public safety, insurance issues, legal implications, and government regulations suggest it is more likely that the first step in the progression will be multifunctional vehicles. Today, embedded controllers as well as a variety of sensors and high-performance computing in present-day cars allow for a smooth transition from complete human control toward semisupervised or assisted control, then to fully automated vehicles. Next-generation vehicles will need to be more active in assessing driver awareness, vehicle capabilities, and traffic and environmental settings, plus how these factors come together to determine a collaborative safe and effective driver-vehicle engagement for vehicle operation. This article reviews a range of issues pertaining to driver modeling for the detection and assessment of distraction. Examples from the UTDrive project are used whenever possible, along with a comparison to existing research programs. The areas addressed include 1) understanding driver behavior and distraction, 2) maneuver recognition and distraction analysis, 3) glance behavior and visual tracking, and 4) mobile platform advancements for in-vehicle data collection and human-machine interface.

Important examples include localization of objects in wireless sensor networks [1] and the Internet of Things [2]; multiple source reconstruction from electroencephalograms [3]; estimation of power spectral density for speech enhancement [4]; or inference in genomic signal processing [5]. Within the Bayesian signal processing framework, these problems are addressed by constructing posterior probability distributions of the unknowns. The posteriors combine optimally all of the information about the unknowns in the observations with the information that is present in their prior probability distributions. Given the posterior, one often wants to make inference about the unknowns, e.g., if we are estimating parameters, finding the values that maximize their posterior or the values that minimize some cost function given the uncertainty of the parameters. Unfortunately, obtaining closed-form solutions to these types of problems is infeasible in most practical applications, and therefore, developing approximate inference techniques is of utmost interest.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974876/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","volume":"34","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2017","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7974876/","accessionNumber":"17026659","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Importance Sampling: The past, the present, and the future","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Importance Sampling: The past, the present, and the future","sourcePdf":"34msp04-bugallo-2699226-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134649S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"7974707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7974707","articleId":"7974876","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7974879,"authors":[{"name":"Michael M.

For example, it can help travelers to choose where to go next, or recommend salesmen the most potential places to deliver advertisements or sell products. In this paper, a method for recommending points of interest (POIs) is proposed based on a collaborative tensor factorization (CTF) technique. Firstly, a generalized objective function is constructed for collaboratively factorizing a tensor with several feature matrices. Secondly, a 3-mode tensor is used to model all users' check-in behaviors, and three feature matrices are extracted to characterize the time distribution, category distribution and POI correlation, respectively. Thirdly, each user's preference to a POI at a specific time can be estimated by using CTF. In order to further improve the recommendation accuracy, PCTF (Partitionbased CTF) is proposed to fill the missing entries of a tensor after clustering its every mode. Experiments on a real checkin database show that the proposed method can provide more accurate location recommendation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974891/","volume":"4","issue":"3","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17026559","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 July 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Partition-based collaborative tensor factorization for POI recommendation","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Partition-based collaborative tensor factorization for POI recommendation","sourcePdf":"JAS040304.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024205S","chronDate":"2017","isNumber":"7974885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570654","citationCount":"30","articleId":"7974891","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":7974896,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Yue","affiliation":["Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, Liaoning, CN"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Yue"},{"name":"Linjiu Wang","affiliation":["Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, Liaoning, CN"],"firstName":"Linjiu","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Teng Ma","affiliation":["Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, Liaoning, CN"],"firstName":"Teng","lastName":"Ma"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-9266"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-9274"}],"articleNumber":"7974896","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":462},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7974896","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Friction","Wheels","Mobile robots","Neural networks","Estimation","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","mobile robots","neurocontrollers","stability","uncertain systems","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","terminal sliding mode control","WMR","slippage effect","wheeled mobile robots","adhesion terrain","robot stability","augmented ground friction model","uncertain friction","mobile platform velocity","radial basis function","closed-loop system","unstructured environment"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JAS.2017.7510553","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570654/7974885/07974896.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica","startPage":"498","endPage":"506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974885","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JAS.2017.7510553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based terminal sliding mode control for WMRs affected by an augmented ground friction with slippage effect","abstract":"Wheeled mobile robots U+0028 WMRs U+0029 encounter unavoidable slippage especially on the low adhesion terrain such that the robots stability and accuracy are reduced greatly. To overcome this drawback, this article presents a neural network U+0028 NN U+0029 based terminal sliding mode control U+0028 TSMC U+0029 for WMRs where an augmented ground friction model is reported by which the uncertain friction can be estimated and compensated according to the required performance. In contrast to the existing friction models, the developed augmented ground friction model corresponds to actual fact because not only the effects associated with the mobile platform velocity but also the slippage related to the wheel slip rate are concerned simultaneously. Besides, the presented control approach can combine the merits of both TSMC and radial basis function U+0028 RBF U+0029 neural networks techniques, thereby providing numerous excellent performances for the closed-loop system, such as finite time convergence and faster friction estimation property. Simulation results validate the proposed friction model and robustness of controller; these research results will improve the autonomy and intelligence of WMRs, particularly when the mobile platform suffers from the sophisticated unstructured environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7974896/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 July 2017","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"17026565","volume":"4","issue":"3","publicationDate":"2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based terminal sliding mode control for WMRs affected by an augmented ground friction with slippage effect","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Neural network based terminal sliding mode control for WMRs affected by an augmented ground friction with slippage effect","sourcePdf":"JAS040309.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027209S","chronDate":"2017","isNumber":"7974885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570654","citationCount":"12","articleId":"7974896","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7974907,"authors":[{"name":"Jinglei Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Jinglei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085848153"},{"name":"Xiaodong Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086140587"},{"name":"Lan Yao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Lan","lastName":"Yao","id":"37086137227"},{"name":"Song Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086011278"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1536-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1537-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7974907","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":224},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Field programmable gate arrays","Network topology","Routing","Power demand","Computer architecture","Dynamic scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","integer programming","integrated circuit layout","iterative methods","linear programming","network routing","network topology","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power consumption improvement","fine-grained dynamically reconfigurable ASNoC topologies","routing path allocation problem","global communications","time intervals","ILP-based method","integral linear programming-based method","task modules","floorplanning","partially dynamically reconfigurable FPGA","application-specific NoC","three-stage reconfigurable topology synthesis approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Application-Specific NoC","Dynamically reconfigurable","Topology synthesis","Temporal partition of communications","Partially Dynamically Reconfigurable FPGAs"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a three-stage reconfigurable topology synthesis approach for Application-Specific NoC (ASNoC) on partially dynamically reconfigurable FPGAs, where the topology is reconfigured dynamically at run-time along with the application's execution.

Secondly, we explore the proper positions of switches in the floorplan for global communications. Finally, considering the reconfiguration costs between adjacent time intervals, the routing path allocation problem is solved for time intervals in an iterative procedure to generate fine-grained dynamically reconfigurable ASNoC topologies for the given application. Experimental results show that, compared to the random partition of communication requirements, the proposed ILP-based method can achieve 12.1% power consumption improvement.

Reference Single Carrier PWM Technique for photovoltaic applications","abstract":"This treatise deals with Transistor Clamped Five Level Inverter using Non-Inverting Double Reference Single Carrier PWM (NIDRSC PWM) Technique. Conventional or two level inverter have drawbacks like: i) Requirement of fast switching devices, ii) Very high dv/dt, iii) High Electromagnetic Interferences (EMI), iv) Bulky filters, v) Faster heating of switches, and vi) Not suitable for high voltage applications. Multilevel Inverters (MLIs) are engaged to conquer the drawbacks of conventional two levels inverter. MLIs generate an AC voltage using small voltage steps obtained with the help of DC supplies or capacitor banks. To design the proposed five level inverter five numbers of power control switches and eight diodes are required. The proposed inverter circuitry is investigated by using Non-Inverting Double Reference Single Carrier PWM (NIDRSC PWM) Technique in terms of harmonics content in output waveform. Under-modulation (modulation Index = 0.85), unity (modulation Index =1) and over-modulation (modulation Index = 1.25) PWM signal is obtained to drive control switches. Simulation results will confirm the functionality, design and operation of the proposed MLI and NIDRSC PWM Technique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7975063/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7975063/","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17028107","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Transistor Clamped Five-Level Inverter using Non-Inverting Double Reference Single Carrier PWM Technique for photovoltaic applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transistor Clamped Five-Level Inverter using Non-Inverting Double Reference Single Carrier PWM Technique for photovoltaic applications","confLoc":"Brasov, Romania","sourcePdf":"0777-bf-001279.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104829S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7963868","isNumber":"7974934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7963868","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7974934","articleId":"7975063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7975067,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Farag\u00f3","affiliation":["Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Farag\u00f3","id":"37889149100"},{"name":"Sorin Hintea","affiliation":["Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Sorin","lastName":"Hintea","id":"37375447200"},{"name":"Florin Sandu","affiliation":["Transilvania University of Brasov, Romania"],"firstName":"Florin","lastName":"Sandu","id":"37297390400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4489-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4488-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4490-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7975067","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tuning","Delays","Phase frequency detector","Array signal processing","Transconductance","Microphone arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","digital control","microphone arrays","tuning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital control mechanism","dual-microphone analog beamformer","mixed-signal processing","wide-range tuning","digital tuning mechanism","dual-microphone array","analog processing","microphone signal","filter tuning","bias current"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["signal and image processing","filtering"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A digital control mechanism for the delay of a dual-microphone analog beamformer","doi":"10.1109/OPTIM.2017.7975067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974934","endPage":"802","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (OPTIM) & 2017 Intl Aegean Conference on Electrical Machines and Power Electronics (ACEMP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (OPTIM) & 2017 Intl Aegean Conference on Electrical Machines and Power Electronics (ACEMP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7963868/7974934/07975067.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OPTIM.2017.7975067","startPage":"797","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7975067","abstract":"The microelectronic industry is driven by the continuous demand for processing capabilities and performance. As such, most processing is performed nowadays in a digital fashion. Analog however is not to be neglected. A key feature in modern mixed-signal processing is wide-range tuning of the analog processing sections. One step forward is the implementation of digitally programmable analog. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the digital tuning mechanism on the analog beamformer of a dual-microphone array. Analog processing consists of having one microphone signal delayed by an allpass filter, in order to be synchronized to the other microphone signal. A Gm-C filter implementation was considered, and filter tuning was performed via the transconductor bias current. Digital control of the bias current was implemented with a current digital to analog converter, enabling a straightforward and simple control mechanism. Transistor-level simulation results validate the proposed design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7975067/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17028100","htmlLink":"/document/7975067/","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"A digital control mechanism for the delay of a dual-microphone analog beamformer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A digital control mechanism for the delay of a dual-microphone analog beamformer","confLoc":"Brasov, Romania","sourcePdf":"0797-bf-004677.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076374S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7963868","isNumber":"7974934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7963868","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7974934","articleId":"7975067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7975072,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The necessary steps to transfer the measured samples into frequency domain and to prepare the data for evaluation with an artificial neural network are discussed. Two experiments are performed with the proposed test setup and neural network architecture, yielding promising results. With the two experiments the validity of the proposed approach is shown and further research is encouraged.

Although humans have five senses, only two of these senses (i.e., sight and hearing) are stimulated by traditional multimedia contents. Therefore, the research efforts try to add additional constituents for stimulating other senses, beside sight and hearing, like smell and touch. This introduces a number of new issues like the evaluation of the QoE for audio/video sequences enriched with additional sensory effects (e.g., light effects, wind, vibration, scent). A multi-sensorial effect QoE parametric model has been introduced in literature based on mean opinion score (MOS) subjective assessment. Multiple linear regression (MLR) with the least square (LS) estimator method was used to obtain the model parameters. In this paper, an alternative approach based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed to estimate the parameters of the multi-sensorial QoE model. In order to show that PSO enhance the estimation accuracy a comparison with LS estimator method has been performed. The results show that the PSO algorithm can provide more accurate estimation of the parameters with respect to LS.","doi":"10.1109/OPTIM.2017.7975095","startPage":"965","endPage":"970","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (OPTIM) & 2017 Intl Aegean Conference on Electrical Machines and Power Electronics (ACEMP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OPTIM.2017.7975095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974934","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (OPTIM) & 2017 Intl Aegean Conference on Electrical Machines and Power Electronics (ACEMP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7963868/7974934/07975095.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quality-of-experience parameter estimation for multisensorial media using Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7975095/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Quality-of-experience parameter estimation for multisensorial media using Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7975095/","accessionNumber":"17028054","publicationDate":"May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quality-of-experience parameter estimation for multisensorial media using Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Brasov, Romania","sourcePdf":"0965-bf-002755.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070885S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7963868","isNumber":"7974934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7963868","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7974934","articleId":"7975095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7975097,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian Virgil Craciun","affiliation":["Electronics and Computer Department, Transilvania University of Brasov, Romania","Siemens Corporate Technology, Brasov, Romania"],"firstName":"Adrian Virgil","lastName":"Craciun","id":"37359373500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4489-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4488-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4490-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7975097","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":340},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","Operational amplifiers","SPICE","Computational modeling","Low pass filters","Mathematical model","Hardware design languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital simulation","hardware description languages","low-pass filters","operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["op amp filters","VHDL","digital simulators","low-pass filter","SPICE models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Real Number Modeling","VHDL Models of Operational Amplifiers Filters"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7975097","doi":"10.1109/OPTIM.2017.7975097","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OPTIM.2017.7975097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974934","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (OPTIM) & 2017 Intl Aegean Conference on Electrical Machines and Power Electronics (ACEMP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (OPTIM) & 2017 Intl Aegean Conference on Electrical Machines and Power Electronics (ACEMP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7963868/7974934/07975097.pdf","startPage":"977","endPage":"982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real number models for op amp filters implemented in VHDL","abstract":"This paper presents simulation models of filters with operational amplifiers that can be used in digital simulators.

The security of the IoT plays an important role in the correct and advantageous functionality of the interconnected devices. For efficiency considerations, some of the IoT data processing is optimal to be implemented in a distributed manner, at the IoT Gateway level, rather than centralized. As a consequence, the hardware implementations of security functions like packet discrimination and filtering are becoming an essential element in future IoT architecture. This paper focuses on the practical and theoretical implementation of the deep packet inspection Wu Manber algorithm in FPGA. The deep packet inspection is a part of the secure IoT Gateway that filters the incoming messages facilitating data flow securely between edge devices and cloud.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (OPTIM) & 2017 Intl Aegean Conference on Electrical Machines and Power Electronics (ACEMP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7963868/7974934/07975101.pdf","startPage":"1001","endPage":"1006","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (OPTIM) & 2017 Intl Aegean Conference on Electrical Machines and Power Electronics (ACEMP)","doi":"10.1109/OPTIM.2017.7975101","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OPTIM.2017.7975101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7974934","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7975101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Securing the IoT gateway based on the hardware implementation of a multi pattern search algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Security","Logic gates","Protocols","Inspection","Sensors","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer network security","Internet of Things","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IoT gateway","multipattern search algorithm","hardware implementation","Internet of Things","interconnected devices","IoT data processing","security functions","packet discrimination","packet filtering","future IoT architecture","deep packet inspection Wu Manber algorithm","FPGA","data flow","edge devices","cloud"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IoTs","Gateway","FPGA","electronic systems","safety","security"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7975101/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Securing the IoT gateway based on the hardware implementation of a multi pattern search algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7975101/","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17028017","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Securing the IoT gateway based on the hardware implementation of a multi pattern search algorithm","confLoc":"Brasov, Romania","sourcePdf":"1001-bf-003956.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053533S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7963868","isNumber":"7974934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7963868","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7974934","articleId":"7975101","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7975166,"authors":[{"name":"Ronakkumar R.

The main objective of cognitive radios is to sense the surrounding and use primary user's vacant spaces and allot them to the secondary users without interference each other. This paper presents the optimal solution and optimizes the Quality of services (QoS) parameters to minimum i.e. smaller as compare other solutions which are induced by different optimization techniques Simulated Annealing (SA) and Genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed algorithm called spider monkey optimization algorithm (SMO). SMO is a swarm intelligence technique which works on foraging behaviour of spider monkeys. SMO is tentative and lapse based synergetic iterative process. Spider monkeys have been categorized as fusion-fission social structure (FHSS) based animals and they divides into smaller subgroups and search food. The proposed algorithm has been used to optimize the performance of QoS parameters in terms of minimum power consumption, minimum bit error rate (BER), maximum throughput, minimum interference and maximum spectral efficiency. The simulation results shows that the fitness scores obtained by the proposed algorithm i.e. SMO are better (smaller) than SA and GA algorithm in the optimization of QoS parameters of cognitive radio system.

Because of that to identify the vehicle is significant task. Vehicle color and number plate recognition are various ways to identify the vehicle. So Vehicle color recognition essential part of an intelligent transportation system. There are several methods for recognizing the color of the vehicle like feature extract, template matching, convolutional neural network (CNN), etc. CNN is emerging technique within the field of Deep learning. The survey concludes that compared to other techniques CNN gives more accurate results with less training time even for large dataset. The images taken from roads or hill areas aren't visible because of haze. Consequently, removing haze may improve the color recognition. The proposed system combines both techniques and it adopts the dark channel prior technique to remove the haze, followed by feature learning using CNN. After feature learning, classification can be performed by effective classification technique like SVM.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7975154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICCT.2017.7975215","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Inventive Communication and Computational Technologies (ICICCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Inventive Communication and Computational Technologies (ICICCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966452/7975154/07975215.pdf","startPage":"335","endPage":"339","doi":"10.1109/ICICCT.2017.7975215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicle color recognition using deep learning for hazy images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 March 2017","displayDocTitle":"Vehicle color recognition using deep learning for hazy images","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-11 March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7975215/","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"17042189","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7975215/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicle color recognition using deep learning for hazy images","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"64.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042003S","chronDate":"10-11 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7966452","isNumber":"7975154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966452","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7975154","articleId":"7975215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7975230,"authors":[{"name":"M.M.

Multipath routing is an attractive option to reduce the number of route discoveries due to such broken paths so that alternate paths are available. Existing approaches to multipath routing employs pre-computed routes determined during phase of route discovery. Disadvantage of these solutions, however, is high mobility because lack of maintenance of alternate paths. Hence, precisely when needed, the routes are often broken. Further data traffic distribution is not adaptive defeating the purpose of multipath routing. To overcome theses problems, we present an AODV based adaptive distributed hybrid multipath (ADHM) routing solution. In a reactive path setup phase, between the source and destination of a data session, multiple paths are built. Data are stochastically spread over the different paths, according to their estimated quality. During the course of the session, paths are continuously monitored and improved in a proactive way. Link failures are dealt with locally. Extensive use of periodic update packets is employed which sample full paths between source and destination nodes in a Monte Carlo way. Simulation results show that the proposed solution results in significant performance improvement.","doi":"10.1109/ICICCT.2017.7975230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7975154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICCT.2017.7975230","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Inventive Communication and Computational Technologies (ICICCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Inventive Communication and Computational Technologies (ICICCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966452/7975154/07975230.pdf","startPage":"410","endPage":"414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AODV based adaptive distributed hybrid multipath routing for mobile AdHoc network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-11 March 2017","displayDocTitle":"AODV based adaptive distributed hybrid multipath routing for mobile AdHoc network","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 March 2017","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7975230/","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"17042237","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7975230/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AODV based adaptive distributed hybrid multipath routing for mobile AdHoc network","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"78.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079148S","chronDate":"10-11 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7966452","isNumber":"7975154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966452","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7975154","articleId":"7975230","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":7975233,"authors":[{"name":"N.S.

Detecting spams or spammers on Twitter has become a recent area of research in social network. However, we present a method based on two new aspects: the identification of spam-tweets without knowing previous background of the user; and the other based on analysis of language for detecting spam on twitter in such topics that are in trending at that time. Trending topics are the topics of discussion that are popular at that time. This growing micro blogging phenomenon therefore benefits spammers. Our work tries to detect spam tweets in based on language tools. We first collected the tweets related to many trending topics, labelling them on the basis of their content which is either malicious or safe. After a labelling process we extracted a many features based on the language models using language as a tool. We also evaluate the performance and classify tweets as spam or not spam. Thus our system can be applied for detecting spam on Twitter, focusing mainly on analysing of tweets instead of the user accounts.","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Inventive Communication and Computational Technologies (ICICCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Inventive Communication and Computational Technologies (ICICCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966452/7975154/07975235.pdf","startPage":"435","endPage":"438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An integrated approach for malicious tweets detection using NLP","doi":"10.1109/ICICCT.2017.7975235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7975154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICCT.2017.7975235","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7975235","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7975235/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 March 2017","displayDocTitle":"An integrated approach for malicious tweets detection using NLP","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"17042257","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-11 March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7975235/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An integrated approach for malicious tweets detection using NLP","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"82.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065119S","chronDate":"10-11 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7966452","isNumber":"7975154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966452","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7975154","articleId":"7975235","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7975239,"authors":[{"name":"Ketan Anand","affiliation":["K L University Vaddeswaram, Guntur, Andhra Pradesh"],"firstName":"Ketan","lastName":"Anand","id":"37086110136"},{"name":"Jay Kumar","affiliation":["North Bihar Power Distribution Corporation Limited, Bihar"],"firstName":"Jay","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37086116772"},{"name":"Kunal Anand","affiliation":["K L University Vaddeswaram, Guntur, Andhra Pradesh"],"firstName":"Kunal","lastName":"Anand","id":"37086110135"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5297-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5298-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7975239","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1275},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Principal component analysis","Facebook","Cloning","Monitoring","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security of data","social networking (online)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OSN","anomaly detection","online social network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OSN","Anomaly Detection","Structural based anomaly detection","Behavioral based anomaly detection"]}],"abstract":"Anomaly in Online Social Network can be referred as abnormal or unexpected behavior which deviates from majority of users.

Languages, device architectures, system specifications, and applications are rapidly adapting to the challenges and opportunities of tightly integrated heterogeneous platforms.

To evaluate these new architectures and programming languages, and to empower researchers to experiment with new ideas, a suite of benchmarks targeting these architectures with close CPU-GPU collaboration is needed. In this paper, we classify applications that target heterogeneous architectures into generic collaboration patterns including data partitioning, fine-grain task partitioning, and coarse-grain task partitioning. We present Chai, a new suite of 14 benchmarks that cover these patterns and exercise different features of heterogeneous architectures with varying intensity. Each benchmark in Chai has seven different implementations in different programming models such as OpenCL, C++ AMP, and CUDA, and with and without the use of the latest heterogeneous architecture features. We characterize the behavior of each benchmark with respect to varying input sizes and collaboration combinations, and evaluate the impact of using the emerging features of heterogeneous architectures on application performance.","doi":"10.1109/ISPASS.2017.7975269","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software (ISPASS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7965804/7975258/07975269.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPASS.2017.7975269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7975258","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software (ISPASS)","startPage":"43","endPage":"54","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-25 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Chai: Collaborative heterogeneous applications for integrated-architectures","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7975269/","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17028496","publicationDate":"April 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7975269/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-25 April 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chai: Collaborative heterogeneous applications for integrated-architectures","confLoc":"Santa Rosa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISPASS201710.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082865S","chronDate":"24-25 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7965804","isNumber":"7975258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7965804","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7975258","articleId":"7975269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7975270,"authors":[{"name":"Heehoon Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering"],"firstName":"Heehoon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086118150"},{"name":"Hyoungwook Nam","affiliation":["College of Liberal Studies, Seoul National University, Korea"],"firstName":"Hyoungwook","lastName":"Nam","id":"37086118318"},{"name":"Wookeun Jung","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering"],"firstName":"Wookeun","lastName":"Jung","id":"37086121537"},{"name":"Jaejin Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering"],"firstName":"Jaejin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086119707"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3889-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3891-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7975270","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":2657},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Machine learning","Graphics processing units","Feature extraction","Kernel","Training","Libraries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graphics processing units","neural nets","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","CNN frameworks","deep learning frameworks","convolutional neural networks","visual recognition","GPU performance characteristics","Caffe","CNTK","TensorFlow","Theano","Torch","convolution algorithms","multiGPU context","AlexNet model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7975270","abstract":"Thanks to modern deep learning frameworks that exploit GPUs, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been greatly successful in visual recognition tasks.

Based on the characteristics obtained, we suggest possible optimization methods to increase the efficiency of CNN models built by the frameworks. We also show the GPU performance characteristics of different convolution algorithms each of which uses one of GEMM, direct convolution, FFT, and the Winograd method. We also suggest criteria to choose convolution algorithms for GPUs and methods to build efficient CNN models on GPUs. Since scaling DNNs in a multi-GPU context becomes increasingly important, we also analyze the scalability of the CNN models built by the deep learning frameworks in the multi-GPU context and their overhead.

This requires a deep understanding of the memory access behavior of the target workloads. It is important to have accurate mechanisms to generate address streams to study memory access behavior at and beyond LLCs. Prior memory trace generation proposals such as WEST and STM utilize LRU stack distance to capture temporal locality in the data access streams. In addition, STM also captures spatial locality information by modeling stride-based access patterns. However, a key drawback of prior models is that the metadata that they store to capture locality is significantly high. In this paper, we propose an efficient, light-weight methodology to generate accurate traces for modeling address Streams for LLC And Beyond (SLAB). SLAB leverages the key insight that memory access patterns can be efficiently characterized by combining locality and reuse statistics captured from both instruction and address streams. Compared to prior studies, which capture patterns solely based on data addresses, using the additional instruction stream localized information significantly reduces the space complexity. For programs where dominant instruction-localized patterns do not exist, SLAB exploits multi-granularity data reuse distances. We evaluate SLAB using SPEC CPU2006 and Cloudsuite benchmarks. With meta-data sizes of less than 7% of the original LLC traces, SLAB demonstrates over 91% accuracy in replicating original application behavior across ~9000 different cache, prefetcher and memory configurations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7975273/","conferenceDate":"24-25 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-25 April 2017","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17028501","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7975273/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Accurate address streams for LLC and beyond (SLAB): A methodology to enable system exploration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate address streams for LLC and beyond (SLAB): A methodology to enable system exploration","confLoc":"Santa Rosa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISPASS201714.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074685S","chronDate":"24-25 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7965804","isNumber":"7975258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7965804","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7975258","articleId":"7975273","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7975281,"authors":[{"name":"Rajesh Kumar","affiliation":["Advanced Micro Devices, Bangalore"],"firstName":"Rajesh","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37086120602"},{"name":"Suchita Pati","affiliation":["Advanced Micro Devices, Bangalore"],"firstName":"Suchita","lastName":"Pati","id":"37089102612"},{"name":"Kanishka Lahiri","affiliation":["Advanced Micro Devices, Bangalore"],"firstName":"Kanishka","lastName":"Lahiri","id":"37265025800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3889-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3891-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7975281","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":231},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Benchmark testing","Hardware","Radiation detectors","Monitoring","Analytical models","Principal component analysis","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microprocessor chips","performance evaluation","program interpreters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance counter driven sampling","binary translators","workload sampling","architectural simulation","hardware performance","dynamic binary translation","DARTS methodology","SPEC CPU2006","dynamic workload behaviours","simulated performance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7975281","abstract":"We motivate DARTS, a new technique for workload sampling to drive architectural simulation, that carefully integrates hardware performance counter monitoring with fast, dynamic binary translation.

GPU designers must develop tools and techniques to understand the effect of these soft errors on applications. This paper presents an error injection-based methodology and tool called SASSIFI to study the soft error resilience of massively parallel applications running on state-of-the-art NVIDIA GPUs. Our approach uses a low-level assembly-language instrumentation tool called SASSI to profile and inject errors. SASSI provides efficiency by allowing instrumentation code to execute entirely on the GPU and provides the ability to inject into different architecture-visible state. For example, SASSIFI can inject errors in general-purpose registers, GPU memory, condition code registers, and predicate registers. SASSIFI can also inject errors into addresses and register indices. In this paper, we describe the SASSIFI tool, its capabilities, and present experiments to illustrate some of the analyses SASSIFI can be used to perform.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7975296/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-25 April 2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"17028469","htmlLink":"/document/7975296/","conferenceDate":"24-25 April 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"SASSIFI: An architecture-level fault injection tool for GPU application resilience evaluation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SASSIFI: An architecture-level fault injection tool for GPU application resilience evaluation","confLoc":"Santa Rosa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISPASS201737.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079198S","chronDate":"24-25 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7965804","isNumber":"7975258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7965804","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"7975258","articleId":"7975296","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":7975298,"authors":[{"name":"Xun Gong","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA"],"firstName":"Xun","lastName":"Gong","id":"37086116491"},{"name":"Rafael Ubal","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA"],"firstName":"Rafael","lastName":"Ubal","id":"37400479400"},{"name":"David Kaeli","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Kaeli","id":"37271686900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3889-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3891-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7975298","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":763},"abstract":"Presilicon simulation is one of the key toolsets for computer architects to evaluate and optimize their future designs. As Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become the platform of choice in many computing communities due to their impressive processing capabilities, computer architecture researchers need a simulation framework that allows them to quantitatively consider design tradeoffs. In this paper, we present the Multi2Sim Kepler simulator framework, a new detailed GPU microarchitecture performance simulator that supports NVIDIA's Kepler shader assembly (SASS) code execution. The toolset provides a disassembler, a functional simulator and a detailed cycle-based simulator. We provide insight into the architecture of the NVIDIA Kepler GPU, describing the details of the streaming multiprocessor, front-end and instruction pipelines. We compare the performance of this new simulator against an NVIDIA K20X, a high-end Kepler device. We also evaluate the performance of NVIDIA's CUDA benchmark suite on our GPU performance simulator.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software (ISPASS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7965804/7975258/07975298.pdf","startPage":"269","endPage":"278","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software (ISPASS)","doi":"10.1109/ISPASS.2017.7975298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPASS.2017.7975298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7975258","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7975298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi2Sim Kepler: A detailed architectural GPU simulator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing units","Instruction sets","Computational modeling","Kernel","Computer architecture","Pipelines","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer architecture","graphics processing units","multiprocessing systems","parallel architectures","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NVIDIA CUDA benchmark","high-end Kepler device","instruction pipelines","streaming multiprocessor","functional simulator","SASS code execution","NVIDIA's Kepler shader assembly","detailed GPU microarchitecture performance simulator","Multi2Sim Kepler simulator framework","simulation framework","computing communities","graphics processing units","computer architecture","Presilicon simulation","detailed architectural GPU simulator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7975298/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-25 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Multi2Sim Kepler: A detailed architectural GPU simulator","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7975298/","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"17028471","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","conferenceDate":"24-25 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi2Sim Kepler: A detailed architectural GPU simulator","confLoc":"Santa Rosa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISPASS201739.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062391S","chronDate":"24-25 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7965804","isNumber":"7975258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7965804","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7975258","articleId":"7975298","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7975305,"authors":[{"name":"Pooja","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Applications, DAV University, Jalandhar, Punjab, India"],"lastName":"Pooja","id":"37573295300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6984-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6985-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7975305","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transforms","Feature extraction","Image retrieval","Histograms","Computational efficiency","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image fusion","image retrieval","transforms","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image retrieval","polar cosine transform","local binary patterns","local feature fusion","global feature fusion","rotation invariant local binary patterns","RLBP","PCT","robust feature set","image databases"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Polar Cosine Transform","Local Binary Patterns","Precision-recall","Bray-Curtis Similarity measure"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel, effective, and efficient approach to image retrieval. Basically, it is a fusion of both global and local features of images, which achieves significantly higher retrieval competency. Initially, the global features of images are determined using polar cosine transforms (PCTs). For local features, we use rotation invariant local binary patterns (RLBP) rather than using the existing ones, which help in improving the retrieval rate and are in alignment with the rotation invariant property of PCTs. The combination of both acquired global and local features is performed by mapping their features into a common domain. Finally, the proposed hybrid approach provides a robust feature set for image retrieval. Detailed experiments are performed on various sorts of image databases. The results of extensive set of experiments reveal the supremacy of the proposed approach over other approaches in terms of efficiency and retrieval results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective image retrieval using polar cosine transform and local binary patterns","publicationTitle":"2016 1st India International Conference on Information Processing (IICIP)","doi":"10.1109/IICIP.2016.7975305","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 1st India International Conference on Information Processing (IICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966476/7975299/07975305.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IICIP.2016.7975305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7975299","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7975305","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7975305/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Effective image retrieval using polar cosine transform and local binary patterns","conferenceDate":"12-14 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7975305/","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"17029472","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective image retrieval using polar cosine transform and local binary patterns","confLoc":"Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"Paperid134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095105S","chronDate":"12-14 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7966476","isNumber":"7975299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966476","xplore-issue":"7975299","articleId":"7975305","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7975311,"authors":[{"name":"Gurashish Singh","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Bharati Vidyapeeth's College of Engineering, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Gurashish","lastName":"Singh","id":"37085422044"},{"name":"Ankit Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Bharati Vidyapeeth's College of Engineering, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Ankit","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37086097883"},{"name":"Kirti Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Bharati Vidyapeeth's College of Engineering, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Kirti","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37598510500"},{"name":"Neeta Pandey","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Delhi Technological University, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Neeta","lastName":"Pandey","id":"37411925000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6984-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6985-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7975311","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":246},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Field programmable gate arrays","Optical signal processing","Encoding","Hardware design languages","Clocks","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","NRZ line coding schemes","non return to zero","Verilog","MentorGraphics ModelSim Edition 10.4a","NRZ-Level","NRZ-Mark","NRZ-Space","Xilinx V.10"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Encoders","Decoders","NRZ","Xilinx","Virtex","Spartan"]}],"abstract":"The paper presents the FPGA implementation of the line coding scheme Non Return to Zero (NRZ).

If that probability is high, the SU has to vacate the channel quickly when the PU will appear. This increases the hand-off and degrades the throughput. In this paper, the probability of appearance of a PU in a particular channel is predicted using an artificial neural network learning technique that learns the previous behavior of the PU.

In this paper, we have discussed about the best improvements one can perform in-order to reduce the interferences faced in the network to zero while also showing the trade-off one would face in terms of number of codes used in the network. It has been shown that the code requirement of i-PCA will vary from (2(\u0394) +3) to (2(2(\u0394) +3)) and 2(\u0394) +1 to 3(\u0394) +1 for i-TCA-PCA Hybrid.

In this work, 3-tier architecture has been developed for CCBRP that has three layers namely normal/regular nodes, Infostation infrastructure, and Cloud server architecture. The performance of CCBRP is evaluated and compared against the Horizontal and Vertical Ferry (HVF) strategy. Results obtained indicate that CCBRP outperforms HVF in respect of average latency and messages delivered.","doi":"10.1109/IICIP.2016.7975366","publicationTitle":"2016 1st India International Conference on Information Processing (IICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 1st India International Conference on Information Processing (IICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966476/7975299/07975366.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IICIP.2016.7975366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7975299","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud computing based routing protocol for infrastructure-based opportunistic networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7975366","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cloud computing based routing protocol for infrastructure-based opportunistic networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7975366/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Aug. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"17040392","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7975366/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud computing based routing protocol for infrastructure-based opportunistic networks","confLoc":"Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"Paperid418.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051266S","chronDate":"12-14 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7966476","isNumber":"7975299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966476","xplore-issue":"7975299","articleId":"7975366","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7975427,"authors":[{"name":"Junsik Park","affiliation":["School of ECE, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Junsik","lastName":"Park","id":"37085387845"},{"name":"Jingook Kim","affiliation":["School of ECE, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jingook","lastName":"Kim","id":"37281190300"},{"name":"Jongsung Lee","affiliation":["Global Technology Center, Samsung Electronics Co, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jongsung","lastName":"Lee","id":"37065076300"},{"name":"Cheolgu Jo","affiliation":["Global Technology Center, Samsung Electronics Co, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Cheolgu","lastName":"Jo","id":"37902259400"},{"name":"Byongsu Seol","affiliation":["Global Technology Center, Samsung Electronics Co, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byongsu","lastName":"Seol","id":"37588651400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3912-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3913-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7975427","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":242},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System-level ESD noise induced by secondary discharges at voltage suppressor devices in a mobile product","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Asia-Pacific International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility (APEMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7961935/7975403/07975427.pdf","startPage":"70","endPage":"72","publicationTitle":"2017 Asia-Pacific International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility (APEMC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEMC.2017.7975427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7975403","doi":"10.1109/APEMC.2017.7975427","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage measurement","Electrostatic discharges","Discharges (electric)","Metals","Noise measurement","Mobile communication","Transmission line measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrostatic discharge","power capacitors","surge protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system-level ESD noises","secondary discharge","voltage suppressor devices","voltage clamping-type","snapback-type devices","TLP measurements","power-ground decoupling capacitors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electrostatic discharge (ESD)","secondary discharge","voltage suppressor device","power-ground noise","snapback","voltage clamping"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7975427","abstract":"The system-level ESD noises induced by a secondary discharge at voltage suppressor devices in a mobile product are measured and analyzed.

Genome Sequencing involves determining the order of the nucleotide subunits found in DNA, which consists of a small number of bases called short reads. The human genome is approximately 3 billion bases in length, which would take months or years to be processed on a single machine. So large numbers of short reads are available in such sequencing. In these cases, the first step in the data analysis pipeline is the short read mapping problem. Speed is becoming significantly important and challenging due to the huge volume of data. In this paper, we have proposed an approach that will take a dataset of DNA sequencing as an input and split them across the cluster machine by applying MapReduce implementation of Hadoop to make the search efficient for large scale genome sequencing applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Innovative Mechanisms for Industry Applications (ICIMIA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966475/7975508/07975518.pdf","startPage":"544","endPage":"547","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Innovative Mechanisms for Industry Applications (ICIMIA)","doi":"10.1109/ICIMIA.2017.7975518","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIMIA.2017.7975518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7975508","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7975518","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genome sequencing using MapReduce and Hadoop \u2014 A technical review","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bioinformatics","Genomics","Hardware","Sequential analysis","DNA","Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","DNA","genetics","genomics","parallel programming","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genome sequencing","MapReduce","Hadoop","genetic information","nucleotide subunits","data analysis pipeline","short-read mapping problem","DNA sequencing","cluster machine"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MapReduce","Hadoop","Genome Sequencing","Speed"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7975518/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Feb. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Genome sequencing using MapReduce and Hadoop \u2014 A technical review","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7975518/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"17029315","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","conferenceDate":"21-23 Feb. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genome sequencing using MapReduce and Hadoop \u2014 A technical review","confLoc":"Bengaluru, India","sourcePdf":"107.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04774S","chronDate":"21-23 Feb. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7966475","isNumber":"7975508","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966475","xplore-issue":"7975508","articleId":"7975518","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7975523,"authors":[{"name":"S Balaji Ramakrishna","affiliation":["Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering, Bangalore, Karnataka, IN"],"firstName":"S Balaji","lastName":"Ramakrishna"},{"name":"A R Aswatha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering, Bengaluru, India"],"firstName":"A R","lastName":"Aswatha","id":"37688894100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5960-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5961-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7975523","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":203},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["SRAM cells","CNTFETs","Electron tubes","Delays","Logic gates","Carbon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carbon nanotube field effect transistors","leakage currents","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CNT diameter variation","read write stability","CNTFET 6t SRAM cell","carbon nano tube FET","high channel mobility","gate capacitance","short channel regime","leakage currents","short channel effects","size 32 nm","voltage 1 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CNTFET","SWCNT","6T SRAM-cell","SNM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7975523","abstract":"Carbon nano tube FETs are most promising candidates of nano electronic system design. Their recent evolution has been leveraging advantages such as high channel mobility and increased gate capacitance in short channel regime. The conventional MOSFETS suffer with exponential increase in leakage currents under down scaling whereas the CNTFETS overcome this limitation and deliver optimal voltage current characteristics. Considering the vast amount of data storage requirements in modern day systems, memories act as the vital blocks and they need to be thoroughly investigated with respect area, power and performance constraints before implementation. SRAM cell is one of the important building blocks in design of memories and a significant amount of attention is being paid into its functionality. The submicron scaling of conventional CMOS devices affect their performance due to short channel effects and circuits become unreliable. To overcome its challenges, in this work, MOSFET like ballistic CNTFETs have found to be the best alternatives for conventional CMOS devices under the 32 nm technology regime. The work focuses on the design and evaluation of the performance metrics of CNTFET based 6T SRAM cells at 32nm technology with observation on variation in chirality of the CNT.

An efficient and low cost automated testing system is elucidated in this paper. The design and development of the automated RF test system is realized. The whole process involves the development of an Automated Test System (ATE) and a software test application to control the tests. The test system uses a RF network analyzer, to automatically measure s-parameter values at 63.86 MHz and 127.72 MHz, depending upon the operating frequency of the pre-amplifier. The system primarily focuses on automating the standard vector network analyzer. The costs involved in the production of a large volume of preamps used in 1.5T and 3T MRI machines is minimized using this automated RF testing methodology. In addition, test operator intervention is significantly reduced. The automated test system minimizes programming and firmware complexities in the test operator level and finally, generates a simple Pass/Fail status and impart the measured s-parameter data to the operator. A detailed analysis is performed to correlate the obtained result to the traditional test setup where in the devised testing method is found to be more accurate and reliable. Also, the impact of the proposed test setup on the final cost per unit is verified.","doi":"10.1109/ICIMIA.2017.7975596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIMIA.2017.7975596","startPage":"177","endPage":"180","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Innovative Mechanisms for Industry Applications (ICIMIA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966475/7975508/07975596.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Innovative Mechanisms for Industry Applications (ICIMIA)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7975508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and development of an automated RF test platform for low noise Pre-Amp","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Feb. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Design and development of an automated RF test platform for low noise Pre-Amp","conferenceDate":"21-23 Feb. 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7975596/","accessionNumber":"17029260","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7975596/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and development of an automated RF test platform for low noise Pre-Amp","confLoc":"Bengaluru, India","sourcePdf":"35.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034734S","chronDate":"21-23 Feb. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7966475","isNumber":"7975508","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966475","xplore-issue":"7975508","articleId":"7975596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7975599,"authors":[{"name":"Kazi Fatima Sharif","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering Dept., Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Kazi Fatima","lastName":"Sharif","id":"37085778755"},{"name":"Riazul Islam","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering Dept., Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Riazul","lastName":"Islam","id":"37085775691"},{"name":"Mahbubul Haque","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering Dept., Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Mahbubul","lastName":"Haque","id":"37086146439"},{"name":"Marzia Akhter Keka","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering Dept., Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Marzia Akhter","lastName":"Keka","id":"37086166506"},{"name":"Satyendra N.

The simulated HDL code is validated using Xilinx ISE synthesizer using Virtex-4 FPGA (XC4VSX35-10FF668). The real time testing of the algorithm is performed with an OFDM system.

Some of the noises which cause a serious degradation in the image quality are multiplicative noise, salt and pepper noise, impulse noise, gaussian noise, additive noise etc. Among these, salt and pepper noise can be eliminated using median filtering techniques. Sorting techniques have been beneficial for median filtering. In this paper a highly efficient optimized sorting algorithm is implemented for median filter. Median filter is used to calculate the median of set of pixel values of a window. To compare the same column pixel values, data is acquired from FPGA parallely. The adjacent median filter results are saved temporarily using D flip-flops. This method increases the efficiency of execution by reducing the comparisons from 21 to 13 and significantly increases 40% efficiency. Sorting algorithm is implemented using FPGA Spartan 6 LX45. It is cost efficient and also power efficient since it consumes half the power compared to earlier Spartan families.","doi":"10.1109/ICIMIA.2017.7975614","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Innovative Mechanisms for Industry Applications (ICIMIA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Innovative Mechanisms for Industry Applications (ICIMIA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966475/7975508/07975614.pdf","startPage":"253","endPage":"257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIMIA.2017.7975614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7975508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of highly efficient sorting algorithm for median filtering using FPGA Spartan 6","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7975614","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Feb. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7975614/","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of highly efficient sorting algorithm for median filtering using FPGA Spartan 6","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"17029370","htmlLink":"/document/7975614/","conferenceDate":"21-23 Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of highly efficient sorting algorithm for median filtering using FPGA Spartan 6","confLoc":"Bengaluru, India","sourcePdf":"51.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055015S","chronDate":"21-23 Feb. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7966475","isNumber":"7975508","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966475","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7975508","articleId":"7975614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7975627,"authors":[{"name":"Arshath Sheeparamatti","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, R.V.

People share their feelings online in a very informal language. Thus, it is very difficult task to analyze exact sentiments attached with that natural language. Sentiment Analysis is a study of people's attitude, opinions, and emotions to classify whether it is positive, negative or neutral. Use of emoticons on social media has increased rapidly in recent years. Hence, we have focused more on how emoticons play an important role in sentiment analysis.

These challenges imply the optimization of these services through biomedical, physical, psychological and socio-environmental interventions. ICT technologies can support the implementation of these healthcare services, e.g., the use of wearable devices to collect the physiological data, cloud technology to store big amounts of data and advanced data analytics algorithms to extract valuable conclusions and actionable knowledge. This work proposes a multi-agent system driven data analysis approach to characterize the daily physiological conditions of a group of elderly people institutionalized in a nursing home, supporting the healthcare professionals to monitor their behavior and promote an active aging. The individual' data were collected by a set of Fitbit Charge HR wristbands and analyzed by clustering algorithms, running in the distributed autonomous agents, allowing to identify and characterize the individuals' daily habits and physiological conditions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7975671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975725","publicationTitle":"2017 12th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 12th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966453/7975671/07975725.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975725","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data driven multi-agent m-health system to characterize the daily activities of elderly people","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Data driven multi-agent m-health system to characterize the daily activities of elderly people","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7975725/","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17028964","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7975725/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data driven multi-agent m-health system to characterize the daily activities of elderly people","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070682S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7966453","isNumber":"7975671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966453","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7975671","articleId":"7975725","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AISTI","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7975729,"authors":[{"name":"Rub\u00e9n Javer Medina Daza","affiliation":["Proyecto Curricular Ingenier\u00eda Catastral y Geodesia, Universidad Distrital Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Caldas (UDFJ), Bogot\u00e1 D.

In the first method from multi-spectral image and image acquired with the UAV get the intensity of the multispectral image (Im) and the intensity of UAV (Iv), using the RGB-IHS transformation respectively. Then applying fusion to the intensity components of Im and Iv using Wavelet transform together with ARSIS' technique to genere a new intensity (n_Imv). This n_Imv together with hue and saturation obtained from Ikonos image are transformed inversely to generate a new multispectral image (N-MULT-I). In the second process a new panchromatic is created through of average of three RGB bands of UAV's image (fpan), then fusion is applied using wavelet transform to Im and fpan to generate a new intensity (n_Ifpm). Using n_Ifpm and hue and saturation components of IKonos image a new image multispectral is generated (N-MULT-fpan). Finally, results are shown and there are evaluated with Correlation Coefficient, ERGAS, RASE and Qu. Finding that better results are obtained with the second process.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving the spatial resolution of the images Ikonos beginning with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV): An application of image fusion with wavelet transform","publicationTitle":"2017 12th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI)","doi":"10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975729","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 12th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966453/7975671/07975729.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7975671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7975729","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7975729/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Improving the spatial resolution of the images Ikonos beginning with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV): An application of image fusion with wavelet transform","conferenceDate":"21-24 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7975729/","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17028901","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving the spatial resolution of the images Ikonos beginning with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV): An application of image fusion with wavelet transform","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060101S","chronDate":"21-24 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7966453","isNumber":"7975671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966453","xplore-issue":"7975671","articleId":"7975729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AISTI","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7975950,"authors":[{"name":"Rosangela Melo","affiliation":["Federal Institute of Education, Science, and Technology of Pernambuco (IFPE), Brazil","Informatics Center, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil"],"firstName":"Rosangela","lastName":"Melo","id":"37085386839"},{"name":"Maria Clara Bezerra","affiliation":["Informatics Center, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil"],"firstName":"Maria Clara","lastName":"Bezerra","id":"37085381866"},{"name":"Jamilson Dantas","affiliation":["Informatics Center, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil"],"firstName":"Jamilson","lastName":"Dantas","id":"38529117700"},{"name":"Rubens Matos","affiliation":["Informatics Center, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil"],"firstName":"Rubens","lastName":"Matos","id":"38241799700"},{"name":"Ivanildo Jos\u00e9 de Melo Filho","affiliation":["Federal Institute of Education, Science, and Technology of Pernambuco (IFPE), Brazil","Informatics Center, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil"],"firstName":"Ivanildo Jos\u00e9","lastName":"de Melo Filho","id":"38245732500"},{"name":"Aline Santana Oliveira","affiliation":["Informatics Center, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil"],"firstName":"Aline Santana","lastName":"Oliveira","id":"37086149098"},{"name":"F\u00e1bio Denilson de Oliveira Feliciano","affiliation":["Federal Institute of Education, Science, and Technology of Pernambuco (IFPE), Brazil"],"firstName":"F\u00e1bio Denilson","lastName":"de Oliveira Feliciano","id":"37085579849"},{"name":"Paulo Romero Martins Maciel","affiliation":["Informatics Center, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, PE, BR"],"firstName":"Paulo Romero","lastName":"Martins Maciel","id":"37087858014"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8998-4347-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5047-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7975950","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Streaming media","Computer architecture","Computational modeling","Analytical models","Maintenance engineering","Sensitivity analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","multimedia computing","sensitivity analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensitivity analysis","cloud computing environments","streaming servers","multimedia applications","video on demand","hierarchical modeling","sensitivity ranking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Availability","Cloud computing","Sensitivity Analysis","Video on Demand"]}],"abstract":"Nowdays, several streaming servers are available to provide a variety of multimedia applications such as Video on Demand in cloud computing environments.

This has been proven true especially for spiking neural network (SNN) with its high multicast communication demands. However, metal-wires that form the foundation for regular NoCs face a set of challenges since metal-wires have been stretched to their physical limits with the relentless technology scaling. Thus, this paper tackles SNN communication issues on two fronts: Firstly, the physical interconnect layer by attempting to prototyping a new and promising type of wireless interconnects called surface-wave interconnects (SWI). Secondly, the architectural level by proposing NoC architecture enabled by SWI and further more effective for multicast communication. A surface-wave has been demonstrated for range 14-25 GHz with improvements over free-space propagation in S21 up to 20 dB. Furthermore, based on this technology a hybrid wire and surface-wave architecture is developed and evaluated to demonstrate its potentials for SNN, which found to perform 95% better than related-work. Consequently, this emerging technology would provide the high efficiency that are required for future NoC-based SNN systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient surface-wave-based network-on-chip architecture for spiking-neural-network","publicationTitle":"2017 Annual Conference on New Trends in Information & Communications Technology Applications (NTICT)","doi":"10.1109/NTICT.2017.7976117","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Annual Conference on New Trends in Information & Communications Technology Applications (NTICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7961934/7976095/07976117.pdf","startPage":"322","endPage":"327","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NTICT.2017.7976117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7976095","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7976117","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976117/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 March 2017","displayDocTitle":"Efficient surface-wave-based network-on-chip architecture for spiking-neural-network","conferenceDate":"7-9 March 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7976117/","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"17027852","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient surface-wave-based network-on-chip architecture for spiking-neural-network","confLoc":"Baghdad, Iraq","sourcePdf":"29SpikingneuralnetworkAmmar6p.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076504S","chronDate":"7-9 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7961934","isNumber":"7976095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7961934","xplore-issue":"7976095","articleId":"7976117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7976122,"authors":[{"name":"Haider Kadiam Hoomod","affiliation":["Computer Science Dept, University of Al-Mustansriyhia, Iraq"],"firstName":"Haider Kadiam","lastName":"Hoomod","id":"37085364014"},{"name":"Saja Hikmat Dawood","affiliation":["Software Engineering Dept, Institute for Postgraduate Studies, Iraq"],"firstName":"Saja Hikmat","lastName":"Dawood","id":"37086141737"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2962-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2963-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7976122","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":501},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Image color analysis","Noise level","Estimation","Colored noise","Chaos","Cellular neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","chaos","computer vision","image denoising","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast image denoising","CNN","noise estimation","artificial neural networks","ANN","cellular neural network","Rossler chaos","noise level algorithm","image noise removal approach","statistical measures","PSNR","RMSE","best quality visual vision"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["image denoising","noise level estimation","cellular neural network","Rossler chaos"]}],"abstract":"Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been applied in many areas successfully because of their ability to learn, ease of implementation and fast real-time operation.

To classify human actions, our recognition process is implemented under different recording conditions from a surveillance camera. By applying Caffe_GoogLeNet framework, we trained our 3D DNN with different training epoch values (TEs). The experiments were then evaluated using three different datasets: KTH, Weizmann, and UCF101 with gray and color resolutions. The results of the experiments demonstrate significantly high performance in the recognition rates by changing the training epoch values (TEs) to accomplish the best classification accuracy with a remarkable short running time. We then compare the classification accuracy results of 3D DNN with other state-of-the-art for three datasets. Classification accuracy resulting is 98.90% for KTH dataset, while Weizmann dataset had an accuracy of 97.02 %. The accuracy of UCF 101 dataset reached to 100% which was the optimum state in our model.","doi":"10.1109/NTICT.2017.7976123","startPage":"240","endPage":"246","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Annual Conference on New Trends in Information & Communications Technology Applications (NTICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7961934/7976095/07976123.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 Annual Conference on New Trends in Information & Communications Technology Applications (NTICT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NTICT.2017.7976123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7976095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human actions recognition based on 3D deep neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Training","Convolution","Surveillance","Communications technology","Cameras","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image colour analysis","image resolution","neural nets","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human actions recognition","3D deep neural network","video frames","3D DNN","surveillance camera","Caffe_GoogLeNet framework","training epoch values","TE","KTH","Weizmann dataset","UCF101","gray resolutions","color resolutions","classification accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Human Action","Surveillance Cameras","3D DNN","Caffe_GoogLeNet","Training Epochs","Classification Accuracy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976123/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 March 2017","displayDocTitle":"Human actions recognition based on 3D deep neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7976123/","publicationDate":"March 2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","conferenceDate":"7-9 March 2017","accessionNumber":"17027842","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human actions recognition based on 3D deep neural network","confLoc":"Baghdad, Iraq","sourcePdf":"343DDeepNeuralFadwa6p.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108228S","chronDate":"7-9 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7961934","isNumber":"7976095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7961934","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7976095","articleId":"7976123","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7976138,"authors":[{"name":"Belal Al-Khateeb","affiliation":["Computer Science Dept., University of Anbar, Ramadi, Iraq"],"firstName":"Belal","lastName":"Al-Khateeb","id":"38275390500"},{"name":"Ali J.

Beginner (inexpert) searchers commonly attempt to find information with ambiguous queries. These ambiguous queries make the search engine returns irrelevant results. This work aims to get more relevant pages to query through query reformulation and expanding search space. The proposed system has three basic parts WordNet, Google search engine and Genetic Algorithm. Every part has a special task. The system uses WordNet to remove ambiguity from queries by displaying the meaning of every keyword in user query and selecting the proper meaning for keywords. The system obtains synonym for every keyword from WordNet and generates query list. Genetic algorithm is used to create generation for every query in query list. Every query in system is navigated using Google search engine to obtain results from group of documents on the Web. The system has been tested on number of ambiguous queries and it has obtained more relevant URL to user query especially when the query has one keyword. The results are promising and therefore open further research directions.","doi":"10.1109/NTICT.2017.7976138","startPage":"91","endPage":"96","publicationTitle":"2017 Annual Conference on New Trends in Information & Communications Technology Applications (NTICT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NTICT.2017.7976138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7976095","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Annual Conference on New Trends in Information & Communications Technology Applications (NTICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7961934/7976095/07976138.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Query reformulation using WordNet and genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976138/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Query reformulation using WordNet and genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7976138/","accessionNumber":"17027836","publicationDate":"March 2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","conferenceDate":"7-9 March 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 March 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Query reformulation using WordNet and genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Baghdad, Iraq","sourcePdf":"45QueryReformulationBelal6p.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071966S","chronDate":"7-9 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7961934","isNumber":"7976095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7961934","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7976095","articleId":"7976138","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7976152,"authors":[{"name":"Hameed R.

In this paper, a novel face recognition method is presented based on one state of discrete HMM, where it seemed impossible in the past. Contrary to other approaches that use the three parameters of the HMM to recognize faces, the proposed work uses only one parameter for discrimination, while the two others are fixed. The method starts with a pre-processing step to remove the influence of noise from the images using the median filter and the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), where at the same time; the DWT possesses a size reduction feature. The reduced size image is prepared to generate a sequence of overlapping blocks. The data manipulated by the model are produced by converting each block to an integer value using some statistical techniques and a quantization process, such that each image is described by a sequence of integers. The experimental results show that the use of one-state model highly reduces the computational complexity of the system and continues in achieving 100% recognition rate, which can be considered a practical breakthrough in the field of face recognition that has superseded the other research efforts in reducing the number of states of HMM, and consequently accomplished reduction of computational complexity and ultimate enhancement of system performance.","doi":"10.1109/NTICT.2017.7976152","publicationTitle":"2017 Annual Conference on New Trends in Information & Communications Technology Applications (NTICT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Annual Conference on New Trends in Information & Communications Technology Applications (NTICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7961934/7976095/07976152.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NTICT.2017.7976152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7976095","startPage":"252","endPage":"257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel face recognition method based on one state of discrete Hidden Markov Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7976152","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel face recognition method based on one state of discrete Hidden Markov Model","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 March 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976152/","conferenceDate":"7-9 March 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"17027825","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7976152/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel face recognition method based on one state of discrete Hidden Markov Model","confLoc":"Baghdad, Iraq","sourcePdf":"6ANovelFaceHameed6p.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077961S","chronDate":"7-9 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7961934","isNumber":"7976095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7961934","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7976095","articleId":"7976152","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7976154,"authors":[{"name":"May H.

However, connecting VSC to a weak grid is challenging since traditional vector control tends to become unstable under high power demand conditions. In this paper, an improved vector control method is proposed wherein a feed forward branch based on steady state and small signal analysis of the VSC system is added under weak grid situations. The feed forward branch promotes faster reactive power response, thus enhancing the stability of the VSC system. Since the improved vector control uses the same inner loop as traditional vector control, the proposed method allows for the ability to retain fault current suppression capabilities. Furthermore, the control parameters of the outer loop of the improved vector control need not vary according to the variation of the operating points, which makes it easy to implement. The feed forward branch is implemented by solving a nonlinear equation or through use of a look-up table. The influence of the estimation errors of short circuit ratio (SCR) on the control performance is also studied. The effectiveness of the improved vector control is demonstrated through small signal model analysis and time domain simulations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase locked loops","Voltage control","Machine vector control","Steady-state","Analytical models","Mathematical model","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault currents","HVDC power convertors","HVDC power transmission","nonlinear equations","power grids","reactive power control","table lookup","voltage-source convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voltage source converter","high voltage direct current transmission","vector control method","reactive power","VSC-HVDC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Improved vector control","VSC-HVDC","weakAC grids."]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7976156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.17775/CSEEJPES.2017.0015","startPage":"115","endPage":"124","publicationTitle":"CSEE Journal of Power and Energy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"CSEE Journal of Power and Energy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7054730/7976156/07976158.pdf","doi":"10.17775/CSEEJPES.2017.0015","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and design of vector control for VSC-HVDC connected to weak grids","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"CSEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and design of vector control for VSC-HVDC connected to weak grids","accessionNumber":"17560000","publicationDate":"June 2017","volume":"3","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976158/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Analysis and design of vector control for VSC-HVDC connected to weak grids","sourcePdf":"JPES201702201.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032823S","chronDate":"June  2017","isNumber":"7976156","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7054730","citationCount":"28","articleId":"7976158","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"CSEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":7976274,"authors":[{"name":"Szymon Szcz\u0119sny","affiliation":["Faculty of Computing, Pozna\u0144 University of Technology, Pozna\u0144, Poland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/8006334/7976274/szcz-2726459-small.gif","p":["Szymon Szcz\u0119sny received the degree in automatics and management from the Faculty of Computing and Management, Poznan University of Technology, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree from the Faculty of Computing, Poznan University of Technology, in 2013, defending a thesis in computer science.

Due to the sporadic communication nature of mMTC, the grant-free transmission methodology is highly expected in uplink NOMA systems, to drastically reduce the transmission latency and signaling overhead. Exploiting the inherent sparsity nature of user activity, compressive sensing (CS) techniques have been applied for efficient multi-user detection in the uplink grant-free NOMA. In this paper, we propose a prior-information-aided adaptive subspace pursuit (PIA-ASP) algorithm to improve the multi-user detection performance. In this algorithm, a parameter evaluating the quality of the prior-information support set is introduced, in order to exploit the intrinsically temporal correlation of active user support sets in several continuous time slots adaptively. Then, to mitigate the incorrect estimation effect of the prior support quality information, a robust PIA-ASP algorithm is further proposed, which adaptively exploits the prior support based on the corresponding support quality information in a conservative way. It is noted that both of the two proposed algorithms do not require the knowledge of the user sparsity level, while most of the state-of-the-art CS-based multi-user detection algorithms usually need. Moreover, for the two proposed algorithms, the upper bound of the signal detection error and the computational complexity is derived. Simulation results demonstrate that the two proposed algorithms are capable of achieving much better performance than that of the existing CS-based multi-user detection algorithms with a similar computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2017.2726279","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/8225762/07976275.pdf","startPage":"2812","endPage":"2828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8225762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2017.2726279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Multi-User Detection for Uplink Grant-Free NOMA: Prior-Information Aided Adaptive Compressive Sensing Perspective","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7976275","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Multi-User Detection for Uplink Grant-Free NOMA: Prior-Information Aided Adaptive Compressive Sensing Perspective","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976275/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17431659","htmlLink":"/document/7976275/","volume":"35","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 July 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61631004"},{"fundingName":"Huawei HIRP Project","grantNumber":"YB2015040056"},{"fundingName":"Sichuan Youth Science and Technology Fund","grantNumber":"2012JQ0020"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Multi-User Detection for Uplink Grant-Free NOMA: Prior-Information Aided Adaptive Compressive Sensing Perspective","sourcePdf":"jsac-chen-2726279-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.186923S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"8225762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"8225762","articleId":"7976275","onlineDate":"12 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7976278,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

Due to the extensive use and ever increasing demand of spectrum bands by wireless devices and newer applications, unlicensed band is becoming congested, while licensed bands are found mostly underutilized. To solve this problem of spectrum scarcity, cognitive radio (CR) devices can share licensed bands opportunistically in several ways. We analyze the three main dynamic sharing models (commons, shared-use, and exclusive-use) proposed in literature with extensive analysis of the exclusive-use model, which is the most promising as it provides benefits to both licensed and unlicensed users. In this model, CR-enabled service providers, also known as secondary service providers, can buy or lease spectrum from licensed, known as primary service providers, for both short and long duration and gain exclusive rights to access the spectrum. In this survey paper, exclusive-use trading approaches, namely, game theory, market equilibrium, and classical, hybrid and other models are reviewed extensively and their characteristics and differences are highlighted and compared. We also propose possible future research directions on exclusive-use CR model.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exclusive Use Spectrum Access Trading Models in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Survey","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2017.2725960","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/8115327/07976278.pdf","startPage":"2192","endPage":"2231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2017.2725960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8115327","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7976278","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976278/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourthquarter  2017","displayDocTitle":"Exclusive Use Spectrum Access Trading Models in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Survey","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7976278/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2017","publicationDate":"Fourthquarter 2017","accessionNumber":"17466439","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001779","fundingName":"Federation University, Australia, and Monash University, Australia, through the Australian Government\u2019s Collaborative Research Network Initiative"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exclusive Use Spectrum Access Trading Models in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Survey","sourcePdf":"comst-hassan-2725960-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.261302S","chronDate":"Fourthquarter  2017","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"8115327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"8115327","articleId":"7976278","onlineDate":"12 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":7976279,"authors":[{"name":"Lina Xu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8059894/7976279/xu-2726014-small.gif","p":["Lina Xu received the B.E. degree from the Software Engineering School, Fudan University, Shanghai, China, and B.Sc degree in computer science from University College Dublin (UCD), Dublin, Ireland, though a Fudan and UCD Joint Program, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from UCD in 2014.","From 2014 to 2016, she was with HP Labs, as a Researcher.

To extend the networks longevity, clustering techniques have been introduced to enhance energy efficiency. This paper presents a survey on clustering over the last two decades. Existing protocols are analyzed from a quality of service (QoS) perspective including three common objectives, those of energy efficiency, reliable communication and latency awareness. This review reveals that QoS aware clustering demands more attention. Furthermore, there is a need to clarify how to improve quality of user experience (QoE) through clustering. Understanding the users' requirements is critical in intelligent systems for the purpose of enabling the ability of supporting diverse scenarios. User awareness or user oriented design is one remaining challenging problem in clustering. In additional, this paper discusses the potential challenges of implementing clustering schemes to Internet of Things (IoT) systems in 5G networks. We indicate that clustering techniques enhanced with smart network selection solutions could highly benefit the QoS and QoE in IoT. As the current studies for WSNs are conducted either in homogeneous or low level heterogeneous networks, they are not ideal or even not able to function in highly dynamic IoT systems with a large range of user scenarios. Moreover, when 5G is finally realized, the problem will become more complex than that in traditional simplified WSNs. Several challenges related to applying clustering techniques to IoT in 5G environment are presented and discussed.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2017.2726014","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2017.2726014","startPage":"1229","endPage":"1249","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8059894/07976279.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8059894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey of Clustering Techniques in WSNs and Consideration of the Challenges of Applying Such to 5G IoT Scenarios","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976279/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Survey of Clustering Techniques in WSNs and Consideration of the Challenges of Applying Such to 5G IoT Scenarios","volume":"4","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17282012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7976279/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey of Clustering Techniques in WSNs and Consideration of the Challenges of Applying Such to 5G IoT Scenarios","sourcePdf":"jiot-xu-2726014-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.230998S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8059894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"8059894","articleId":"7976279","onlineDate":"12 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7976281,"authors":[{"name":"Peiying Zhang","affiliation":["College of Computer & Communication Engineering, China University of Petroleum (East China), Qingdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8534511/7976281/zhang-2726120-small.gif","p":["Peiying Zhang is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in information and communication engineering at the State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the College of Computer & Communication Engineering, China University of Petroleum (East China), Beijing.

The main challenge in this respect is the efficient embedding the virtual nodes and virtual links from the VN requests onto the limited substrate network resources. The notion of storage resource can exchange bandwidth resource to some extent gives us a hint that the efficient utilization of storage resource can relieve the bandwidth resource consumption. The existing VN embedding model does not consider the storage resource constraints on substrate nodes and virtual nodes, and does not keep up with the need of actual situation. In this paper, we propose a novel VN embedding model based on 3-D resource constraints including computing, network and storage, and devise two heuristic algorithms as the baseline algorithms to deal with the VN embedding problem. To our best of our knowledge, this is the first time to propose VN embedding problem based on 3-D resources including computing, network, and storage.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2017.2726120","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8534511/07976281.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2017.2726120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8534511","startPage":"3298","endPage":"3304","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual Network Embedding Based on Computing, Network, and Storage Resource Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7976281","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Virtual Network Embedding Based on Computing, Network, and Storage Resource Constraints","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976281/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 July 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18582228","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7976281/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007129","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province","grantNumber":"ZR2014FQ018"},{"fundingName":"BUPT-SICE Excellent Graduate Students Innovation Fund, \u201cthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities\u201d of China University of Petroleum (East China)","grantNumber":"13CX02031A"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471056"},{"fundingName":"China Research Project on Key Technology Strategy of Infrastructure Security for Information Network Development"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual Network Embedding Based on Computing, Network, and Storage Resource Constraints","sourcePdf":"jiot-zhang-2726120-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086367S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8534511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"8534511","articleId":"7976281","onlineDate":"12 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7976286,"authors":[{"name":"Yingyang Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/8225762/7976286/chen-2726006-small.gif","p":["Yingyang Chen received the B.Eng. degree in electronic engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2014.

However, the ever-increasing tele-traffic is expected to result in overcrowding of the available band. As a first resort, multiple input multiple output (MIMO) can be utilized to enhance the attainable bandwidth efficiency or link reliability. However, in hostile V2V wireless propagation environments, the achievable multiple-antenna gain is eroded by the channel correlation. As a promising MIMO technique, spatial modulation (SM) only activates a single transmit antenna (TA) in any symbol interval and, hence, completely avoids the inter-antenna interference, hence showing robustness against channel correlation. As a further powerful solution, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been proposed for improving the bandwidth efficiency. Inspired by the robustness of SM against channel correlation and the benefits of NOMA, we intrinsically amalgamate them into NOMA-SM in order to deal with the deleterious effects of wireless V2V environments as well as to support improved bandwidth efficiency. Moreover, the bandwidth efficiency of NOMA-SM is further boosted with the aid of a massive TA configuration. Specifically, a spatio-temporally correlated Rician channel is considered for a V2V scenario. We investigate the bit error ratio performance of NOMA-SM via Monte Carlo simulations, where the impact of the Rician K-factor, spatial correlation of the antenna array, time-varying effect of the V2V channel, and the power allocation factor is discussed. Furthermore, we also analyze the capacity of NOMA-SM. By analyzing the capacity and deriving closed-form upper bounds on the capacity, a pair of power allocation optimization schemes are formulated. The optimal solutions are demonstrated to be achievable with the aid of our proposed algorithm. Again, instead of simply invoking a pair of popular techniques, we intrinsically amalgamate SM and NOMA to conceive a new system component exhibiting distinct benefits in the V2V scenarios considered.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2017.2726006","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/8225762/07976286.pdf","startPage":"2653","endPage":"2666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8225762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2017.2726006","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of NOMA-SM in Vehicle-to-Vehicle Massive MIMO Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7976286","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of NOMA-SM in Vehicle-to-Vehicle Massive MIMO Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976286/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17431670","htmlLink":"/document/7976286/","volume":"35","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 July 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC of China","grantNumber":"61571056 and 61531004"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008081","fundingName":"Open Research Fund of the National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory of Southeast University","grantNumber":"2016D04"},{"fundingName":"State Major Science and Technology Special Projects of China","grantNumber":"2016ZX03001017-004"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council Advanced Fellow Grant"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of NOMA-SM in Vehicle-to-Vehicle Massive MIMO Channels","sourcePdf":"jsac-wang-2726006-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13928S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"8225762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"8225762","articleId":"7976286","onlineDate":"12 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7976293,"authors":[{"name":"Bingyu Xu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/8225762/7976293/xu-2726398-small.gif","p":["Bingyu Xu received the double B.Sc. degrees in telecommunications engineering with management from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, and the Queen Mary University of London, London, U.K., in 2014, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering.

Each BS can serve multiple users at the same time and frequency band. To deal with the fluctuation of renewable energy harvesting, we consider that renewable energy can be shared between BSs via the smart grid. In such networks, user association and power control need to be re-designed, since existing approaches are based on OMA. Therefore, we formulate a problem to find the optimum user association and power control schemes for maximizing the energy efficiency of the overall network, under quality-of-service constraints. To deal with this problem, we first propose a distributed algorithm to provide the optimal user association solution for the fixed transmit power. Furthermore, a joint user association and power control optimization algorithm is developed to determine the traffic load in energy-cooperation enabled NOMA HetNets, which achieves much higher energy efficiency performance than existing schemes. Our simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, and show that NOMA can achieve higher energy efficiency performance than OMA in the considered networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976293/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","volume":"35","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"17431672","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7976293/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation in Energy-Cooperation Enabled Two-Tier NOMA HetNets Toward Green 5G","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation in Energy-Cooperation Enabled Two-Tier NOMA HetNets Toward Green 5G","sourcePdf":"jsac-xu-2726398-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116814S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"8225762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"8225762","articleId":"7976293","onlineDate":"12 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7976297,"authors":[{"name":"Rifaqat Hussain","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, King Fahd University for Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Rifaqat","lastName":"Hussain","id":"38282017500"},{"name":"Asim Ghalib","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, King Fahd University for Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Asim","lastName":"Ghalib","id":"37085570858"},{"name":"Mohammad S.

Apache Hadoop is an open-source ecosystem that manages large data sets in a distributed environment. MapReduce is a programming model that processes massive amount of unstructured data sets over Hadoop cluster. Recently, Hadoop enhances its homogeneous storage function to heterogeneous storage and stores data sets into multiple storage media, i.e., SSD, RAM, and DISK. This development increases the performance of data block placement strategy and allows a client to store large data sets into multiple storage media efficiently than homogeneous storage. However, this evolution increases the consumption of computing capacity and memory usage over MapReduce job scheduling. The scheduler processes MapReduce job into homogeneous container having configuration of CPU, memory, DISK volume, and network I/O, and accesses, processes, and stores data sets over heterogeneous storage media. This produces a processing latency of locating and pairing source data set to MapReduce tasks and results an abnormal high consumption of computing capacity and memory usage in a Datanode. Similarly, when scheduler assigns MapReduce jobs to multiple Datanodes, the same processing latency can severely affect the performance of whole cluster. In this paper, we present Storage-Tag-Aware Scheduler (STAS) that reduces processing latency by scheduling MapReduce jobs into heterogeneous storage containers, i.e., SSD, DISK, and RAM container. STAS endorses job with a tag of storage media, such as JobSSD, JobDISK, and JobRAM and parses them into heterogeneous shared-queues, which assign processing configuration to enlist jobs. STAS manager then schedules shared-queue jobs into heterogeneous MapReduce containers and generates an output into storage media of the cluster. The experimental evaluation shows that STAS optimizes the consumption of computing capacity and memory usage efficiently than available schedulers in a Hadoop cluster.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2725318","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07976300.pdf","startPage":"13742","endPage":"13755","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2725318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Storage-Tag-Aware Scheduler for Hadoop Cluster","topic":"Emerging Trends, Issues, and Challenges in Energy-Efficient Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976300/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","displayDocTitle":"Storage-Tag-Aware Scheduler for Hadoop Cluster","volume":"5","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17124428","htmlLink":"/document/7976300/","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea through the Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"NRF-2017R1D1A1B03032855"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Storage-Tag-Aware Scheduler for Hadoop Cluster","sourcePdf":"access-qureshi-2725318-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136494S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Emerging Trends, Issues, and Challenges in Energy-Efficient Cloud Computing"],"articleId":"7976300","onlineDate":"12 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7976305,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed S.

The problem is formulated as a network utility maximization problem for which a Lyapunov framework is used to decompose it into two disjoint subproblems of auxiliary variable selection and rate maximization. The latter is further decoupled into a user association and mode selection (UAMS) problem and a UL/DL power optimization (UDPO) problem that are solved concurrently. The UAMS problem is modeled as a many-to-one matching problem whose goal is to associate users to small cell base stations and select transmission mode (half-/full-duplex and orthogonal/NOMA). Then, an algorithm is proposed to solve the problem by finding a pairwise stable matching. Subsequently, the UDPO problem is formulated as a sequence of convex problems and is solved using the concave-convex procedure. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is effective in allocating UL and DL power levels after dynamically selecting the operating mode and the served users, under different traffic intensity conditions, network density, and self-interference cancellation capability. The proposed scheme is shown to achieve up to 63% and 73% of gains in UL and DL packet throughput, and 21% and 17% in UL and DL cell edge throughput, respectively, compared with the existing baseline schemes.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/49/8225762/7976305-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976305/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","volume":"35","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"17431669","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7976305/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Resource optimization and power allocation in in-band full duplex-enabled non-orthogonal multiple access networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003406","fundingName":"TEKES","grantNumber":"2364/31/2014"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003406","fundingName":"TEKES, Nokia, MediaTek, Bittium, Keysight, and Kyynel \u201cHigh5\u201d Project","grantNumber":"2192/31/2016"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland CARMA Project"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1460316, CNS-1513697 and CNS-1460333"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"ERC Starting Grant MORE (Advanced Mathematical Tools for Complex Network Engineering)","grantNumber":"305123"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Resource optimization and power allocation in in-band full duplex-enabled non-orthogonal multiple access networks","sourcePdf":"jsac-elbamby-2726218-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11054S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"8225762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"8225762","articleId":"7976305","onlineDate":"12 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7976308,"authors":[{"name":"Beixiong Zheng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China","School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/8038094/7976308/zheng-2726008-small.gif","p":["Beixiong Zheng received the B.S. degree from the South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

By exploiting the interference signals received from neighbor users with the leverage of the full-duplex technique, we enhance the decoding ability of each user and further achieve an effective multiuser interference management for the network. We propose different decoding strategies for different types of nodes by processing the received signals with only local incoming channel state information in different manners. Moreover, under the limited group decoding size, each individual node decodes its own desired messages along with a fraction of the interference successively. We further investigate the joint uplink and downlink fair rate allocation problem based on the max-min criterion, and the solution to which also contains the optimal group decoding schedule. Simulation results in terms of ergodic rate and outrage probability corroborate the superiority of our NOMA-based multi-pair TWR network over the OMA-based counterpart.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2017.2726008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2017.2726008","startPage":"2328","endPage":"2341","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/8038094/07976308.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038094","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NOMA-Based Multi-Pair Two-Way Relay Networks With Rate Splitting and Group Decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976308/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"NOMA-Based Multi-Pair Two-Way Relay Networks With Rate Splitting and Group Decoding","volume":"35","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17171288","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7976308/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61329101 and 61671211"},{"fundingName":"Leading Talents Program of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"00201510"},{"fundingName":"Basic Research Program of Shenzhen","grantNumber":"JCYJ20151117161854942"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005320","fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks of Xidian University","grantNumber":"ISN17-03"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NOMA-Based Multi-Pair Two-Way Relay Networks With Rate Splitting and Group Decoding","sourcePdf":"jsac-zheng-2726008-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.192347S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"8038094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"8038094","articleId":"7976308","onlineDate":"12 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7976310,"authors":[{"name":"Sze Sing Lee","affiliation":["University of Southampton Malaysia Campus, Johor Bahru, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Sze Sing","lastName":"Lee","orcid":"0000-0003-2455-5783","id":"37085378293"},{"name":"Michail Sidorov","affiliation":["University of Southampton Malaysia Campus, Johor Bahru, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Michail","lastName":"Sidorov","id":"37086218641"},{"name":"Chee Shen Lim","affiliation":["University of Southampton Malaysia Campus, Johor Bahru, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Chee Shen","lastName":"Lim","id":"37086213888"},{"name":"Nik Rumzi Nik Idris","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor Bahru, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Nik Rumzi Nik","lastName":"Idris","orcid":"0000-0002-5048-3851","id":"37430312700"},{"name":"Yeh En Heng","affiliation":["University of Southampton Malaysia Campus, Johor Bahru, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Yeh En","lastName":"Heng","id":"37085729399"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8993"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0107"}],"articleNumber":"7976310","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2298},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-pels.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Inverters","Switches","Prototypes","Harmonic analysis","Low voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bridge circuits","harmonics suppression","power system control","PWM invertors","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid cascaded multilevel inverter","improved symmetrical 4-level submodule","multiple dc voltage levels","conducting switch","gate driver requirements","half-bridge submodule","HCMLI topology","9-level single-phase inverter","selective harmonic elimination pulse-width-modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hybrid cascaded multilevel inverter (HCMLI)","reduced switch count","symmetrical submodule"]}],"abstract":"This letter proposes an improved symmetrical 4-level submodule as a basic cell for generating multiple dc voltage levels.

of RF multi-functional bandpass filter with multiple frequency-reconfigurable rejected bands that are embedded into its broad transmission frequency range is reported. This filter concept exploits an original tunable multi-band quasi-bandstop section as constituent block. In this manner, unprecedented levels of spectral adaptivity are obtained for its in-band notches. Among them: 1) independent control of center frequency and rejection level; 2) notch-combination capability to conform wider rejected bands and make their number dynamically selectable; and 3) generation of dual-band bandpass responses with adjustable bandwidth and inter-band transmission zeros. This results in controllable in-band stopbands with reconfigurable bandwidth, attenuation level, and filtering-profile type. The devised filter architecture, which is appropriate for dynamic multi-interference mitigation in broad-band RF receivers, is scalable to any number of arbitrary-order in-band notches. For proof-of-concept purposes, a UHF-band microstrip prototype with up to two tunable in-band second-order stopbands is manufactured and measured.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976313/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","volume":"65","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"17875379","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2018","publicationDate":"July 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7976313/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"RF Wide-Band Bandpass Filter With Dynamic In-Band Multi-Interference Suppression Capability","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100002186","fundingName":"Lockheed Martin","grantNumber":"4102673517.01"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003329","fundingName":"Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Competitividad","grantNumber":"TEC2014-54289-R"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RF Wide-Band Bandpass Filter With Dynamic In-Band Multi-Interference Suppression Capability","sourcePdf":"tcsii-gomezgarcia-2726145-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04951S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8396242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8396242","articleId":"7976313","onlineDate":"12 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7976317,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Shen","affiliation":["School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China","Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8858/8895602/7976317/shen-2725953-small.gif","p":["Jian Shen received the ME and PhD degrees in computer science from Chosun University, South Korea, in 2009 and 2012, respectively.

However, how to ensure the security of data sharing within a group and how to efficiently share the outsourced data in a group manner are formidable challenges. Note that key agreement protocols have played a very important role in secure and efficient group data sharing in cloud computing. In this paper, by taking advantage of the symmetric balanced incomplete block design (SBIBD), we present a novel block design-based key agreement protocol that supports multiple participants, which can flexibly extend the number of participants in a cloud environment according to the structure of the block design. Based on the proposed group data sharing model, we present general formulas for generating the common conference key IC for multiple participants. Note that by benefiting from the (v, k + 1, 1)-block design, the computational complexity of the proposed protocol linearly increases with the number of participants and the communication complexity is greatly reduced. In addition, the fault tolerance property of our protocol enables the group data sharing in cloud computing to withstand different key attacks, which is similar to Yi's protocol.","doi":"10.1109/TDSC.2017.2725953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8895602","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDSC.2017.2725953","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/8858/8895602/07976317.pdf","startPage":"996","endPage":"1010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block Design-Based Key Agreement for Group Data Sharing in Cloud Computing","supplementGroup":[{"repository":"code-ocean","type":"algorithm","badge":"Available","badgeMsg":"This document includes code submitted by the author.","supplement":[{"doi":"10.24433/CO.6b08d728-fc8b-4af7-8f1d-cae7c28af097","uri":"https://codeocean.com/2017/10/17/block-design-based-key-agreement-for-group-data-sharing-in-cloud-computing-colon-efficiency-comparison-for-different-simulation-times","name":"Block Design-based Key Agreement for Group Data Sharing in Cloud Computing:\u00a0Efficiency comparison for different simulation times","language":"C/C++","widgetUrl":"https://codeocean.com/widget.js?id=6b08d728-fc8b-4af7-8f1d-cae7c28af097","badgeType":"Code-Available"},{"doi":"10.24433/CO.a433f2e9-2003-45d1-b519-98bf3aec28dc","uri":"https://codeocean.com/2017/10/17/block-design-based-key-agreement-for-group-data-sharing-in-cloud-computing-colon-efficiency-comparison-for-multiple-participants","name":"Block Design-based Key Agreement for Group Data Sharing in Cloud Computing:\u00a0Efficiency comparison for multiple participants","language":"C/C++","widgetUrl":"https://codeocean.com/widget.js?id=a433f2e9-2003-45d1-b519-98bf3aec28dc","badgeType":"Code-Available"},{"doi":"10.24433/CO.eea19cea-ca33-4f3c-b641-f46fb7b79253","uri":"https://codeocean.com/2017/10/17/block-design-based-key-agreement-for-group-data-sharing-in-cloud-computing-colon-efficiency-comparison-for-different-phases","name":"Block Design-based Key Agreement for Group Data Sharing in Cloud Computing: Efficiency comparison for different phases","language":"C/C++","widgetUrl":"https://codeocean.com/widget.js?id=eea19cea-ca33-4f3c-b641-f46fb7b79253","badgeType":"Code-Available"}]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Block Design-Based Key Agreement for Group Data Sharing in Cloud Computing","volume":"16","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1 2019","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7976317/","publicationDate":"1 Nov.-Dec. 2019","accessionNumber":"19230833","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976317/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61672295, 61373169, 61572379, 61501333 and U1405254"},{"fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Information Security","grantNumber":"2017-MS-10"},{"fundingName":"2015 Project of six personnel in Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"R2015L06"},{"fundingName":"CICAEET"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012246","fundingName":"Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block Design-Based Key Agreement for Group Data Sharing in Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"tdsc-xiang-2725953-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.463801S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"8895602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8895602","articleId":"7976317","onlineDate":"12 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7976318,"authors":[{"name":"Geum-Young Tak","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8270698/7976318/tak-2719685-small.gif","p":["Geum-Young Tak (M\u201907) received B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2000 and 2002, respectively.","From 2002 to 2005, he was with the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), Daejeon, Korea, where he was involved in designing Bluetooth transceiver and UWB ICs.

The antenna impedance is selected to reduce the impedance-transform ratio with the GaN HEMT. In addition, the active antenna includes a second-harmonic-tuning circuit for high efficiency. The active antenna comprises antenna- and amplifier-circuit layers piled onto a Peltier unit, which has a high affinity with this cooling systems. The antenna and amplifier circuits are designed on low- and high-dielectric substrates, respectively, enabling the amplifier to be downsized and the antenna gain to be increased. Each layer is connected by a through-hole. First, the single-stage amplifier is fabricated with a maximum output power of 37.95 dBm and a maximum PAE of 62.94%.

In this paper, we present a flexible shape-based texture representation using shape co-occurrence patterns. More precisely, texture images are first represented by a tree of shapes, each of which is associated with several geometrical and radiometric attributes. Then, four typical kinds of shape co-occurrence patterns based on the hierarchical relationships among the shapes in the tree are learned as codewords. Three different coding methods are investigated for learning the codewords, which can be used to encode any given texture image into a descriptive vector. In contrast with existing works, the proposed approach not only inherits the shape-based method's strong ability to capture geometrical aspects of textures and high robustness to variations in imaging conditions but also provides a flexible way to consider shape relationships and to compute high-order statistics on the tree. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that co-occurrence patterns of explicit shapes have been used as a tool for texture analysis. Experiments on various texture and scene data sets demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Texture Characterization Using Shape Co-Occurrence Patterns","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2017.2726182","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7983498/07976325.pdf","startPage":"5005","endPage":"5018","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2017.2726182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7983498","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7976325","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976325/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Texture Characterization Using Shape Co-Occurrence Patterns","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7976325/","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17132019","pubMedId":"28708559","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41501462 and 91338113"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Texture Characterization Using Shape Co-Occurrence Patterns","sourcePdf":"tip-xia-2726182-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.181779S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7983498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7983498","articleId":"7976325","onlineDate":"12 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7976332,"authors":[{"name":"Yanling Wei","affiliation":["Research Institute of Intelligent Control and Systems and the State Key Laboratory of Robotics and Systems, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yanling","lastName":"Wei","id":"37085532525"},{"name":"Ju H.

SM exploits the deployment of multiple transmitters by encoding user information on their spatial domain. In most works related to SM, a perfect synchronization among these multiple transmitters is assumed. However, synchronization error can result from multipath propagation in OWC channel, and clock jitter and variation in propagation delay of each transmitter. Synchronization error degrades system performance and hence the need to investigate its effect. Using union bound technique, and defining synchronization errors as timing offsets in the received signals, we derive the symbol error rate for space shift keying (SSK), generalized SSK (GSSK), SM, and generalized SM (GSM) schemes, and we validate our analysis with tightly matched simulation results. Results show that degradation in performance increases with synchronization error. While SSK is tolerant for a small range of synchronization error, GSSK, SM, and GSM are significantly impaired. Our results also demonstrate the dependence of SM on channel gain values. We observe that the lower the channel gain of the transmitter in which synchronization error occurs, the lesser the impact of the synchronization error on the system performance.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2726067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8214934","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2726067","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8214934/07976341.pdf","startPage":"5362","endPage":"5374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of Synchronization Error on Optical Spatial Modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Synchronization Error on Optical Spatial Modulation","volume":"65","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7976341/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17431464","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976341/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Synchronization Error on Optical Spatial Modulation","sourcePdf":"tcomm-olanrewaju-2726067-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150042S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8214934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8214934","articleId":"7976341","onlineDate":"12 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7976348,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Dowling","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Michael Dowling received his BS (2010) from Bob Jones University, Greenville, SC (summa cum laude) and his MS (2012) and PhD (2016) from the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Clemson University, Clemson, SC.

These results are for expander codes whose inner codes are parity-check codes. By using stronger inner codes, Chilappagari et al.

The resolution of the ADC is scalable to enable power savings depending on link modulation format (2 PAM/4 PAM) and link loss. A 1-bit folding stage determines the MSB, while the LSBs are determined by a 5-bit full flash where each comparator can be individually enabled/disabled. At 6-bit resolution, the ADC including a variable gain amplifier achieves an SNDR of 30.7 dB and an SFDR of 40.6 dB at Nyquist frequency while consuming 34.4 mW from a 0.9-V supply, yielding an FOM of 303 fJ/conv-step. At lower resolutions of 5, 4, and 3 bits, the FOM remains low at 295, 320, and 399 fJ/conv-step, respectively, at Nyquist frequency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976362/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","volume":"64","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"17390390","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7976362/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A 4-GS/s Single Channel Reconfigurable Folding Flash ADC for Wireline Applications in 16-nm FinFET","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Huawei Canada Research Centre"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002790","fundingName":"NSERC"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 4-GS/s Single Channel Reconfigurable Folding Flash ADC for Wireline Applications in 16-nm FinFET","sourcePdf":"tcsii-wang-2726063-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084182S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8118325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8118325","articleId":"7976362","onlineDate":"12 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7976368,"authors":[{"name":"Harsh Tataria","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology (ECIT), Queen\u2019s University Belfast, Belfast, U.K."],"firstName":"Harsh","lastName":"Tataria","orcid":"0000-0001-6085-4102","id":"37085769730"},{"name":"Peter J.

Our analysis assumes spatially correlated Ricean fading channels with maximum-ratio combining on the uplink. Unlike previous studies, our model accounts for the presence of unequal correlation matrices, unequal Rice factors, as well as unequal link gains to each terminal. The derived approximations lend themselves to useful insights, special cases and show the combined impact of line-of-sight (LoS) and correlated components. Numerical results show that while unequal correlation matrices enhance the system performance, the presence of strong LoS has an opposite effect. The approximations are general and remain insensitive to changes in the system dimensions, signal-to-noise-ratios, LoS levels, and correlation levels.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/8064977/07976368.pdf","startPage":"634","endPage":"637","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2017.2726062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2017.2726062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8064977","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7976368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Line-of-Sight and Unequal Spatial Correlation on Uplink MU-MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Uplink","Fading channels","Linear matrix inequalities","Attenuation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","correlation methods","diversity reception","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","radio spectrum management","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["line-of-sight","unequal spatial correlation","uplink MU-MIMO systems","closed-form approximations","ergodic sum spectral efficiency","multiuser multiple-input multiple-output system","Ricean fading channels","maximum-ratio combining","unequal correlation matrices","unequal Rice factors","unequal link gains","signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio","LoS levels","SINR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ergodic sum spectral efficiency","expected SINR","line-of-sight","MU-MIMO","unequal correlation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976368/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Line-of-Sight and Unequal Spatial Correlation on Uplink MU-MIMO Systems","volume":"6","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7976368/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17241267","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Line-of-Sight and Unequal Spatial Correlation on Uplink MU-MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"lwc-tataria-2726062-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050758S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"8064977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8064977","articleId":"7976368","onlineDate":"12 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7976374,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0001-9089-6418","id":"37086017063"},{"name":"Min Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085459348"},{"name":"Danshi Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Danshi","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0001-9815-4013","id":"37085516737"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"7976374","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1479},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Demodulation","Feature extraction","Optical fiber communication","Neurons","Complexity theory","Adaptive systems","Optical vortices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","image recognition","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive demodulator","machine learning","orbital angular momentum shift keying","OAM","image recognition","convolutional neural network","CNN","Laguerre-Gaussian beams","demodulating error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical vortex","machine learning","atmospheric turbulence","free-space optical communication"]}],"abstract":"An $m$ -ary adaptive demodulator based on machine learning for light beams carrying orbital angular momentums (OAMs) over free-space turbulence channels is proposed and demonstrated. Benefiting from natural advantages in the image recognition, convolutional neural network (CNN) is selected to construct the adaptive demodulator. Without extra space light modulators and digital signal processing at the reception, the adaptive demodulator transforms the sequence of intensity patterns of received Laguerre-Gaussian beams carrying different OAM modes into initial signals efficiently. As comparison, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), naive Bayes classifier (NBC), and back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) are also studied. Furthermore, the demodulating accuracy of 4-, 8-, and 16-ary OAM is investigated with the comprehensive consideration of the atmospheric turbulence, OAM mode spacing, and transmission distance. The simulation results show that the demodulating error rate (DER) of CNN outperforms KNN, NBC, and BP-ANN, especially under stronger turbulence and longer distance. The DER of CNN is ~0.86% for the 1000-m 8-OAM system under strong turbulence, ~30 % less than those of KNN, NBC, and BP-ANN.","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2017.2726139","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/68/7997984/07976374.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2017.2726139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7997984","startPage":"1455","endPage":"1458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Demodulator Using Machine Learning for Orbital Angular Momentum Shift Keying","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7976374","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Demodulator Using Machine Learning for Orbital Angular Momentum Shift Keying","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.1, 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976374/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 July 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"17","publicationDate":"1 Sept.1, 2017","accessionNumber":"17132608","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7976374/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC Project","grantNumber":"61372119"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Demodulator Using Machine Learning for Orbital Angular Momentum Shift Keying","sourcePdf":"lpt-li-2726139-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056286S","chronDate":"Sept.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"7997984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7997984","articleId":"7976374","onlineDate":"12 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7976380,"authors":[{"name":"Hai-Lin Liu","affiliation":["Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/8367832/7976380/liu-2725902-small.gif","p":["Hai-Lin Liu received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Henan Normal University, Xinxiang, China, the M.S. degree in applied mathematics from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and engineering from the South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China.","He is currently a Professor with the School of Applied Mathematics, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou.

This paper presents a new adaptive search effort allocation strategy for multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition MOEA/D-M2M, a recent MOEA/D algorithm for challenging MaOPs. This proposed method adaptively adjusts the subregions of its subproblems by detecting the importance of different objectives in an adaptive manner. More specifically, it periodically resets the subregion setting based on the distribution of the current solutions in the objective space such that the search effort is not wasted on unpromising regions. The basic idea is that the current population can be regarded as an approximation to the Pareto front (PF) and thus one can implicitly estimate the shape of the PF and such estimation can be used for adjusting the search focus. The performance of proposed algorithm has been verified by comparing it with eight representative and competitive algorithms on a set of degenerated MaOPs with disconnected and connected PFs. Performances of the proposed algorithm on a number of nondegenerated test instances with connected and disconnected PFs are also studied.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2017.2725902","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2017.2725902","startPage":"433","endPage":"448","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/4235/8367832/07976380.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8367832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptively Allocating Search Effort in Challenging Many-Objective Optimization Problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976380/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Adaptively Allocating Search Effort in Challenging Many-Objective Optimization Problems","volume":"22","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 May 2018","accessionNumber":"17800962","publicationDate":"June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7976380/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61673121"},{"fundingName":"Projects of Science and Technology of Guangzhou","grantNumber":"201508010008"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001665","fundingName":"ANR/RCC Joint Research Scheme through the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001866","fundingName":"France National Research Agency","grantNumber":"A-CityU101/16"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptively Allocating Search Effort in Challenging Many-Objective Optimization Problems","sourcePdf":"tevc-liu-2725902-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151461S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"8367832","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"8367832","articleId":"7976380","onlineDate":"12 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7976386,"authors":[{"name":"Rong Wang","affiliation":["Center for OPTical IMagery Analysis and Learning, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/7983498/7976386/wang-2726188-small.gif","p":["Rong Wang (M\u201912) received the B.E. degree in information engineering, the M.E. degree in signal and information processing, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the Xi\u2019an Research Institute of Hi-Tech, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2004, 2007, and 2013, respectively.

However, the projection matrix in LPP is not orthogonal, thus creating difficulties for both reconstruction and other applications. As the orthogonality property is desirable, orthogonal LPP (OLPP) has been proposed so that an orthogonal projection matrix can be obtained based on a step by step procedure; however, this makes the algorithm computationally more expensive. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a fast and orthogonal version of LPP, called FOLPP, which simultaneously minimizes the locality and maximizes the globality under the orthogonal constraint. As a result, the computation burden of the proposed algorithm can be effectively alleviated compared with the OLPP algorithm. Experimental results on two face recognition data sets and two hyperspectral data sets are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976386/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7976386/","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17132020","pubMedId":"28708560","volume":"26","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fast and Orthogonal Locality Preserving Projections for Dimensionality Reduction","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401471"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Post-doctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014M562636"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and Orthogonal Locality Preserving Projections for Dimensionality Reduction","sourcePdf":"tip-nie-2726188-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165595S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7983498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7983498","articleId":"7976386","onlineDate":"12 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7976391,"authors":[{"name":"Xuesong Jonathan Tan","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8103982/7976391/tan-2726352-small.gif","p":["Xuesong Jonathan Tan received the B.S. degree from Sichuan\n University, Chengdu, China, in 1988, the M.S. degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of\n China, Chengdu, China, in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2004, all\n in electrical engineering.

Based on the combinatorial concept of the union of disjoint difference sets (UDDS), the present paper proposes two novel symmetric channel hopping (CH) schemes, namely UDDSSCH and UDDS-ACH, for CUs with or without a synchronized time clock, respectively, to achieve blind rendezvous. By deriving their performance metrics, we then point out that both UDDS-SCH and -ACH can be optimized by adopting a special UDDS, which can be partitioned into mutually disjoint minimal difference sets (MDSs) as many as possible. This stimulates us to further develop exhaustive and heuristic solutions for searching the optimal and suboptimal numbers of mutually disjoint MDSs at high and low computational complexities, respectively. Based on these searching results, we finally show that both UDDS-SCH and -ACH can achieve better performance metrics than most existing symmetric CH schemes and remedy one major shortcoming of the best known ones, i.e., incapability to rendezvous at an arbitrary number of spectrum channels. Numerical simulation demonstrates that, when primary users may appear at part of or all rendezvous channels, the proposed CH schemes will outperform the existing ones in terms of the average transmission throughput and time of the CRN.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2726352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8103982","startPage":"10233","endPage":"10248","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8103982/07976391.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symmetric Channel Hopping for Blind Rendezvous in Cognitive Radio Networks Based on Union of Disjoint Difference Sets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976391/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7976391/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Symmetric Channel Hopping for Blind Rendezvous in Cognitive Radio Networks Based on Union of Disjoint Difference Sets","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17372495","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"66","issue":"11","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471104"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China","grantNumber":"ZYGX2016J017"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program (863 Program) of China","grantNumber":"2015AA01A705"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symmetric Channel Hopping for Blind Rendezvous in Cognitive Radio Networks Based on Union of Disjoint Difference Sets","sourcePdf":"tvt-tan-2726352-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132138S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8103982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8103982","articleId":"7976391","onlineDate":"12 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7976392,"authors":[{"name":"Byunghun Lee","affiliation":["GT-Bionics Laboratory, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Byunghun","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085346416"},{"name":"Maysam Ghovanloo","affiliation":["GT-Bionics Laboratory, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Maysam","lastName":"Ghovanloo","orcid":"0000-0001-9502-3704","id":"37275363200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7976392","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":842},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7976392","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance","Capacitors","Signal to noise ratio","Electrodes","Topology","Low-noise amplifiers","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS integrated circuits","biomedical electronics","CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit design","low noise amplifiers","low-power electronics","neurophysiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["central nerve recording applications","peripheral nerve recording applications","input referred noise","low noise amplifier","noise efficiency factor","ultra-low noise multichannel recording","peripheral nervous system","channel selection analog multiplexer","proof-of-concept-prototype AFE","BiCMOS process","standard CMOS process","adaptive averaging low noise front-end","complementary doubled input transconductance topology","high input impedance DC-coupled LNA","size 2.5 mm","power 11.0 muW","size 130 nm","size 2.4 mm","voltage 1 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low noise amplifier","peripheral nerve recording","noise efficiency factor","closed-loop DC offset rejection","noise averaging","doubled-gm"]}],"abstract":"An adaptive averaging low noise analog frontend (AFE) is presented for central and peripheral nerve recording applications.

In view of cost reduction problem while ensuring a good performance to users, this paper presents a priority based scheduling based on task and resource clustering. New metrics for task clustering mixing between QoS and provider cost are providedin order to assign scheduling priorities to every task. The proposed Multiple QoS priority based Scheduling ensures lower executiontime for all workflow in cloud computing, ensuring less delay for user and less cost for cloud provider.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Global Summit on Computer & Information Technology (GSCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966934/7976634/07976642.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"20","publicationTitle":"2016 Global Summit on Computer & Information Technology (GSCIT)","doi":"10.1109/GSCIT.2016.8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GSCIT.2016.8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7976634","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7976642","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Priority Scheduling Protocol Based on Cost in Cloud Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Processor scheduling","Virtual machining","Resource management","Servers","Optimization","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","distributed processing","dynamic programming","protocols","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic priority scheduling protocol","cloud computing","distributed computing model","storage distribution","virtualized computer resources","computation equipment","QoS","provider cost","scheduling priorities"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Scheduling","Cloud Computing","cost optimization","cloud provider cost","cloud resources clustering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976642/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Priority Scheduling Protocol Based on Cost in Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7976642/","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"17030123","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Priority Scheduling Protocol Based on Cost in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Sousse, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"2659a015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056191S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7966934","isNumber":"7976634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966934","xplore-issue":"7976634","articleId":"7976642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7976647,"authors":[{"name":"Essaies Meriam","affiliation":["Mediatron, Higher School of Communication of Tunis, University of Carthage, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Essaies","lastName":"Meriam","id":"37085450274"},{"name":"Nabil Tabbane","affiliation":["Mediatron, Higher School of Communication of Tunis, University of Carthage, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Nabil","lastName":"Tabbane","id":"37550846400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2659-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2660-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7976647","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":589},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Scheduling algorithms","Scheduling","Virtual machining","Quality of service","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computational complexity","scheduling","virtual machines","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing scheduling algorithm","distributed computing model","task allocation","storage distribution","virtualized computer resources","task scheduling algorithm","NP-complete problem","job scheduling algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Task scheduling algorithms"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing is a distributed computing modelwhich enables developers to automatically deploy applicationsduring task allocation and storage distribution.

This is a challenging issue due to the situations that Mobile Users (MUs) may face in such context such as the inconstancy of wireless networks, mobility, server load or battery drain. Most cloudlet-based contributions rely on the selection of one resource for offloading that offers good network condition and high computing capabilities. The performance of the selected cloudlet may degrade over time thus leads to the re-selection of another one to perform a seamless service continuity. Our paper proposes the selection of two cloudlets, one ensuring good network connection and one ensuring high performance execution of the application in order to keep the MU \"Always Best Connected and Served\" (ABC&S) on both levels: network and cloud. We aim at predicting some MU situations and at finding the optimal solution in order to minimize unnecessary handoffs and unnecessary service migration.","doi":"10.1109/GSCIT.2016.21","publicationTitle":"2016 Global Summit on Computer & Information Technology (GSCIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Global Summit on Computer & Information Technology (GSCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966934/7976634/07976656.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"96","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GSCIT.2016.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7976634","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7976656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Utility-Based Cloudlet Selection in Mobile Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976656/","displayDocTitle":"Utility-Based Cloudlet Selection in Mobile Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7976656/","publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2016","accessionNumber":"17030105","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utility-Based Cloudlet Selection in Mobile Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Sousse, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"2659a091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069996S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7966934","isNumber":"7976634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966934","xplore-issue":"7976634","articleId":"7976656","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7976664,"authors":[{"name":"W.

But it becomes dangerous silently with in a long period of 10-15 years. Hence early diagnosis is an essential action to prevent it in early stages. In this study most commonly used Neural Networks such as Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), Radial Basic Function (RBF) and Linear Vector Quantization (LVQ) networks are used. Dimensionally reduced Cervical Pap smear Dataset using Fuzzy Edge Detection method is considered for classification.

Again higher-bit QDF provides greater detection probability than lower-bit QDF, due to the loss of more information in lower-bit QDF. In this paper, we derive a non-uniform quantized data fusion (N-QDF) rule that simultaneously enhances the detection probability for a given false alarm probability & higher bit QDF with minimum control channel overhead.

This data delivery has proven to be beneficial for vehicular communication. The vehicular network provisions safety, warning and infotainment applications. Infotainment applications have attracted drivers and passengers as it provides location based entertainment services, a value add to the traveling experience. These infotainment messages are delivered to the nearby vehicles in the form of advertisements. For every advertisement disseminated to its neighboring vehicle, an incentive is awarded to the forwarder. The incentive based earning foresee a security threat in the form of a malicious node as it hoards the incentives, thus are greedy for earning incentives. The malicious behavior of the insider has an adverse effect on the incentive based advertisement distribution approach.

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is the enabling modulation technique for Cognitive Radios because of its flexible nature. The use of OFDM in Cognitive Radio will reduce intersymbol interference, but Out Of Band (OOB) leakage will still exists which effect the performance of licensed users operating in adjacent bands. Spectral mask based on precoding matrix is an efficient technique for reducing OOB radiation across Cognitive Radio user. In this paper, a new method is proposed for efficient utilization of spectral mask with simple equalization technique by considering the presence of licensed users, their position and controlling Out Of Band radiation without using notch frequencies. The simulation results show that proposed technique effectively reduces the Out Of Band radiation without reducing BER with minimal interference is offered to adjacent licensed users and reduction in computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/IACC.2017.0070","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 7th International Advance Computing Conference (IACC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7974917/7976734/07976804.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7976734","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IACC.2017.0070","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 7th International Advance Computing Conference (IACC)","startPage":"292","endPage":"296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Technique to Mitigate Interference between Adjacent Bands in Cognitive Radio System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7976804","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Jan. 2017","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Technique to Mitigate Interference between Adjacent Bands in Cognitive Radio System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976804/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7976804/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"17030513","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","conferenceDate":"5-7 Jan. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Technique to Mitigate Interference between Adjacent Bands in Cognitive Radio System","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"1560a292.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088856S","chronDate":"5-7 Jan. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7974917","isNumber":"7976734","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7974917","xplore-issue":"7976734","articleId":"7976804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7976830,"authors":[{"name":"Manikya Krishna Chaitanya Durbhakula","affiliation":["JNTU College of Engineering, Hyderabad, Telangana, IN"],"firstName":"Manikya Krishna Chaitanya","lastName":"Durbhakula","id":"37086919313"},{"name":"Venkata Koteswara Rao Nalam","affiliation":["Department of E.C.E, Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Venkata Koteswara Rao","lastName":"Nalam","id":"37086046979"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1560-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1561-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2473-3571"}],"articleNumber":"7976830","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":215},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7976830","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna radiation patterns","Patch antennas","Substrates","Three-dimensional displays","Electric fields","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband antennas","cognitive radio","microstrip antennas","radio spectrum management","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wide band patch antenna structures","cognitive radio applications","wireless connectivity","CR technology","dynamic access techniques","unlicensed secondary users","licensed spectrum","spectrum sensing applications","semi-circular crown shaped antennas","semi-circular triangle shaped","CST microwave studio suite"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","Wide Band","Patch antenna","Ku Band","Spectrum Sensing","CST Microwave Studio"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IACC.2017.0096","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 7th International Advance Computing Conference (IACC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 7th International Advance Computing Conference (IACC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7974917/7976734/07976830.pdf","startPage":"434","endPage":"439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IACC.2017.0096","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7976734","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wide Band Patch Antenna Structures for Cognitive Radio Applications","abstract":"The growing demand for the wireless connectivity has insisted a new communication technique to exploit the usage of spectrum in an efficient way.

A special antenna is required in Cognitive Radio applications for spectrum sensing and communicating. Wide Band antennas are being considered as the most suitable structures for spectrum sensing applications and are perfectly suitable these environments. In this paper, an attempt is made to present the design of simple patch antenna structures by using circular, semi-circular, Semi-circular triangle shaped, semi-circular crown shaped antennas for achieving the wide band characteristics. These structures were analyzed theoretically and the simulation was done by using CST Microwave Studio Suite. All the structures were fabricated and analyzed in between 1-18 GHz frequency range on RT-Duroid substrate. It is found that these Structures achieve an enhanced impedance bandwidth over the frequency ranges other than Ultra Wide Band (UWB) range and up to Ku Band.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Jan. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976830/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17030450","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","conferenceDate":"5-7 Jan. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7976830/","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Wide Band Patch Antenna Structures for Cognitive Radio Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide Band Patch Antenna Structures for Cognitive Radio Applications","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"1560a434.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037559S","chronDate":"5-7 Jan. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7974917","isNumber":"7976734","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7974917","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7976734","articleId":"7976830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7976831,"authors":[{"name":"Malladhi Nagarjuna","affiliation":["Vardhaman College of Engineering, Shamshabad, Telangana, IN"],"firstName":"Malladhi","lastName":"Nagarjuna"},{"name":"Gadham Mamatha","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Vardhaman College of Engineering Shamshabad, Hyderabad, Telangana, India"],"firstName":"Gadham","lastName":"Mamatha","id":"37086154000"},{"name":"S.

Traditionally SRAM has been used to design memory. The major problem to design a memory using SRAM is area, power and delay. The memories designed with SRAM will result in high power, high delay and consumes more area. To overcome this problem, a DRAM cell is designed witch results in low power, low area and low delay. There are certain disadvantages with these two designs, and to overcome limitations a new gain cell is designed in this paper. A 2Kb dynamic memory architecture has been designed using the proposed modified 3T gain cell. An architecture is designed with features of high speed, low power, and low delay. The dynamic memory architecture is implemented using Cadence Analog Design Environment. The proposed and conventional dynamic memory architectures were compared in terms of power and delay for variable supply voltages and temperatures.","doi":"10.1109/IACC.2017.0097","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 7th International Advance Computing Conference (IACC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 7th International Advance Computing Conference (IACC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7974917/7976734/07976831.pdf","startPage":"440","endPage":"443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7976734","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IACC.2017.0097","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Low Power Dynamic Memory Architecture Using Single Supply 3T Gain Cell","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7976831","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Jan. 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Low Power Dynamic Memory Architecture Using Single Supply 3T Gain Cell","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976831/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17030420","htmlLink":"/document/7976831/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Jan. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Low Power Dynamic Memory Architecture Using Single Supply 3T Gain Cell","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"1560a440.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038324S","chronDate":"5-7 Jan. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7974917","isNumber":"7976734","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7974917","xplore-issue":"7976734","articleId":"7976831","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":7976858,"authors":[{"name":"Jeebananda Panda","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication, Delhi Technological University, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Jeebananda","lastName":"Panda","id":"37531733000"},{"name":"Akshay Uppal","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication, Delhi Technological University, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Akshay","lastName":"Uppal","id":"37085661047"},{"name":"Akhil S Nair","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication, Delhi Technological University, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Akhil S","lastName":"Nair","id":"37086186355"},{"name":"Bhavesh Agrawal","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication, Delhi Technological University, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Bhavesh","lastName":"Agrawal","id":"37086183352"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1560-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1561-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2473-3571"}],"articleNumber":"7976858","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":201},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7976858","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Discrete wavelet transforms","Biological cells","Robustness","Genetic algorithms","Frequency-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","discrete wavelet transforms","genetic algorithms","image colour analysis","image watermarking","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","optimized color image watermarking","SVD","DWT","singular value component","scaling factor","PSNR values","fitness criteria","noise correlation","singular value decomposition","discrete wavelet transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete Wavelet Transform","Singular Value Decomposition","Genetic Algorithm","Watermark","PSNR","NC"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IACC.2017.0124","pdfPath":"/iel7/7974917/7976734/07976858.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 7th International Advance Computing Conference (IACC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 7th International Advance Computing Conference (IACC)","startPage":"579","endPage":"583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7976734","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IACC.2017.0124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic Algorithm Based Optimized Color Image Watermarking Technique Using SVD and DWT","abstract":"This paper presents a new optimized DWT-SVD based watermarking technique using Genetic Algorithm.

In the CC, the authentication as well as trust and reputation of the cloud users and service provider is a critical issue for the security of the cloud. Lots of articles previously present different trust models, but unfortunately, these trust models are not suitable for all cases as the trust is a non-measurable and subjective parameter that differs person to person. The trust involves many multi-dimensional factors such as evidence, reputation, expectations, feedback, history, risk, motivation, session behaviours, and so on. To addresses the above-mentioned issues, the paper present a novel multi-dimensional trust and reputation calculation model for the cloud computing, in which we integrate multiple trust factors that increase the novelty of the model. Additionally, we dynamically assign a weight for each trust and reputation factor using the Weighted Moving Average and Ordered Weighted Averaging (WMA-OWA) combination algorithm. The proposed model overcome the issues of the previous existing models. The detail presentation and analysis of the model shows that the model is appropriate and accurate for trust calculation in the cloud.","doi":"10.1109/ISEASP.2017.7976983","publicationTitle":"2017 ISEA Asia Security and Privacy (ISEASP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 ISEA Asia Security and Privacy (ISEASP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966624/7976974/07976983.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISEASP.2017.7976983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7976974","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-dimensional trust and reputation calculation model for cloud computing environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7976983","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A multi-dimensional trust and reputation calculation model for cloud computing environments","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 29 2017-Feb. 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976983/","conferenceDate":"29 Jan.-1 Feb. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"17029506","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7976983/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-dimensional trust and reputation calculation model for cloud computing environments","confLoc":"Surat, India","sourcePdf":"paper10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083952S","chronDate":"Jan. 29 2017-Feb. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7966624","isNumber":"7976974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966624","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7976974","articleId":"7976983","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7976988,"authors":[{"name":"Kamatchi Arjunan","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, National Institute of Technology Goa, India"],"firstName":"Kamatchi","lastName":"Arjunan","id":"37086034375"},{"name":"Chirag N.

It uses different classifiers viz; naive bayes, decision tree, random forest, extra trees and linear discriminant analysis for an efficient and effective detection of intrusions. To detect distributed attacks at each cluster and at whole Cloud, it collects intrusion evidences from each region of Cloud and applies Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) for final decision making.

All the transactions of this currency are recorded and stored in a publically available database called blockchain. Since, these transactions are available to everyone, bitcoins must be stored in a secured wallet. These bitcoin wallets can be opened only by its secret key. And if once the secret key of the wallet is lost, it cannot be recovered because of the irreversible nature of bitcoin transaction. To root out this problem, Goldfeder et al. [4] proposed a solution of threshold signature scheme compatible with bitcoins signature by using Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) providing security policy of shared control of a wallet in which each player gets only a single share. Considering an important point of priority/weightage of players, Dikshit and Singh [12] first proposed a scheme in which each player is given one or more shares of the secret key according to his weightage/priority. This scheme has a drawback of managing and handling many keys by each player. Suppose a player has weightage w, then he possesses w different shares of secret key. This problem is resolved in the proposed scheme in this paper. We propose a scheme in which all the players get single share and can accomplish the requirements of concept of weightage. We extend the weighted threshold ECDSA scheme in order to realize efficient weighted threshold ECDSA scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ISEASP.2017.7976994","publicationTitle":"2017 ISEA Asia Security and Privacy (ISEASP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 ISEA Asia Security and Privacy (ISEASP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966624/7976974/07976994.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISEASP.2017.7976994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7976974","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient weighted threshold ECDSA for securing bitcoin wallet","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient weighted threshold ECDSA for securing bitcoin wallet","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17029510","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7976994/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7976994/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 29 2017-Feb. 1 2017","conferenceDate":"29 Jan.-1 Feb. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient weighted threshold ECDSA for securing bitcoin wallet","confLoc":"Surat, India","sourcePdf":"paper36.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077011S","chronDate":"Jan. 29 2017-Feb. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7966624","isNumber":"7976974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966624","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7976974","articleId":"7976994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7977006,"authors":[{"name":"Arvind Kamble","affiliation":["Computer Science & Engineering Department, S.S.D.G.C.T Sanjay Ghodawat Group of Institutions, Kolhapur, India"],"firstName":"Arvind","lastName":"Kamble","id":"37086183484"},{"name":"Virendra S.

The growing interest for the Internet of Things is contributing to the large-scale deployment of Low power and Lossy Networks (LLN). These networks support communications amongst sensor devices from the real world and their interconnection to the Internet. An open standard routing protocol called RPL has been specified by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in order to address the specific properties and constraints of these networks. However, this protocol is exposed to a large variety of attacks. Their consequences can be quite significant in terms of network performance and resources It is apparent that security will pose a fundamental enabling factor for the successful deployment and use of most IoT applications and in particular secure routing among IoT sensor nodes thus, mechanisms need to be designed to provide secure routing communications for devices enabled by the IoT.

The cipher LiCi has Feistel based network which operates on 64 bits plain text and with the help of 128 bits key length it generates 64 bits cipher text. This cipher design shows good performance both on hardware as well as on software platforms. As compared to the existing cipher it requires less footprint area that consumes only 1153 GE's (Gate Equivalents) and has less memory requirements. It also consumes only 30mW which is less power as compared to the other existing ciphers. LiCi cipher needs only 1944 bytes of Flash memory which is very less memory size till date. In this paper, we proposed the security analysis as well as performance parameter of the LiCi. The LiCi cipher resists the linear and differential attack. It also shows the good resistance against the advanced attack like Biclique and Zero correlation. This cipher is well suited for application where small footprint area and low power dissipation are important design metrics.","doi":"10.1109/ETIICT.2017.7977007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7976999","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETIICT.2017.7977007","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Emerging Trends & Innovation in ICT (ICEI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Emerging Trends & Innovation in ICT (ICEI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966455/7976999/07977007.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"45","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LiCi: A new ultra-lightweight block cipher","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Feb. 2017","displayDocTitle":"LiCi: A new ultra-lightweight block cipher","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7977007/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"17029170","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7977007/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LiCi: A new ultra-lightweight block cipher","confLoc":"Pune, India","sourcePdf":"ICEI2017Paper064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097452S","chronDate":"3-5 Feb. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7966455","isNumber":"7976999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966455","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7976999","articleId":"7977007","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7977046,"authors":[{"name":"Rolf Drechsler","affiliation":["Cyber-Physical Systems, DFKI GmbH, Bremen, Germany","Institute of Computer Science, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Rolf","lastName":"Drechsler","id":"37276502700"},{"name":"Stephan Eggersglu\u00df","affiliation":["Universitat Bremen, Bremen, Bremen, DE"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Eggersglu\u00df","id":"37543142600"},{"name":"Nils Ellendt","affiliation":["Department of Production Engineering, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Nils","lastName":"Ellendt","id":"37076505900"},{"name":"Sebastian Huhn","affiliation":["Cyber-Physical Systems, DFKI GmbH, Bremen, Germany","Institute of Computer Science, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Huhn","id":"37085849139"},{"name":"Lutz Madler","affiliation":["Department of Production Engineering, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Lutz","lastName":"Madler","id":"37076887300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2541-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2542-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2473-9413"}],"articleNumber":"7977046","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Material properties","Throughput","Optimization","Uncertainty","Correlation","Metals","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","structural engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["superior structural materials","multi-objective optimization","formal techniques","alternate process parameters"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7977046","abstract":"The continuous progress in engineering requires increasingly powerful materials being utilized in complex constructions. Commonly used methodologies are hardly capable to explore materials with improved properties, i.e., fulfilling a certain performance profile. An alternative high throughput screening approach exists which allows to process a high number of samples while operating on micro scale. For structural materials, it is not possible to project material properties from the micro to the macro scale. Due to the complex nexuses between the process parameters (applied for sample synthesis), the high-dimensional space of the screening data and the uncertainties concerning material properties while scaling, conventional algorithms are not capable to cope with these data. Thus, this work proposes a general data flow which orchestrates multi-objective optimization approaches as well as formal techniques to handle this challenging computational task. In the end, a framework is drawn that determines the resulting material properties on a macro level by using screening data of micro samples and compares them against a performance profile. For the case that only a slight correlation exists, the framework proposes a batch of alternate process parameters which are, highly probable, leading to superior structural material.","doi":"10.1109/ISED.2016.7977046","startPage":"13","endPage":"17","publicationTitle":"2016 Sixth International Symposium on Embedded Computing and System Design (ISED)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISED.2016.7977046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7977039","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Sixth International Symposium on Embedded Computing and System Design (ISED)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966456/7977039/07977046.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring superior structural materials using multi-objective optimization and formal techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7977046/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Exploring superior structural materials using multi-objective optimization and formal techniques","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7977046/","accessionNumber":"17029256","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring superior structural materials using multi-objective optimization and formal techniques","confLoc":"Patna, India","sourcePdf":"03ised157inviteda4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063702S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7966456","isNumber":"7977039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966456","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7977039","articleId":"7977046","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7977049,"authors":[{"name":"Djamila Dekkiche","affiliation":["SATIE, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, Cachan, France"],"firstName":"Djamila","lastName":"Dekkiche","id":"37086053313"},{"name":"Bastien Vincke","affiliation":["SATIE, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, Cachan, France"],"firstName":"Bastien","lastName":"Vincke","id":"37681880800"},{"name":"Alain Merigot","affiliation":["SATIE, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, Cachan, France"],"firstName":"Alain","lastName":"Merigot","id":"37282416400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2541-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2542-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2473-9413"}],"articleNumber":"7977049","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Optimization","Computer architecture","Computer vision","Acceleration","C++ languages","Programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","driver information systems","embedded systems","image resolution","optimisation","parallel architectures","shared memory systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system-level optimizations","kernel-level optimizations","computer vision applications","embedded systems","advanced driver assistance systems","ADAS","real-time update rates","image resolution","function granularity","kernel granularity","hardware architectures","memory bandwidth loading","inter-processor communication","OpenVX framework","Numerical Template Toolbox Library","customized accelerated imaging","generative programming model","acceleration techniques","vectorization","shared memory parallelization","NVIDIA Tegra X1 ARM cores"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7977049","abstract":"Accelerating computer vision applications for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) is not a trivial task. Indeed, ADAS require real-time update rates at high image resolution. The task of accelerating computer vision applications falls into two major axes: system-level optimizations and kernel-level optimizations. The formal accelerate the whole use-case, while the latter act at the kernel or function granularity. In this paper, we propose an approach to target both system-level and kernel-level optimizations on different hardware architectures. While system-level optimizations cover, for instance memory bandwidth loading and inter-processor communication, kernel-level optimizations accelerate single kernels. Our approach consists in merging OpenVX framework and Numerical Template Toolbox (NT\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) Library.

A two-step hybrid method to extract open port 2-wire and power line topologies and facilitate channel model simulation using a biologically-inspired Genetic Algorithm (GA) iterative optimization is discussed. An initial approximate estimate of the loop topology is obtained from Correlation Time Domain Reflectometry (CTDR), a technique well-discussed in literature. Subsequently, a GA optimization working on the outputs of Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR) data of the loop progresses iteratively and converges to a more accurate topology. The GA defines a fitness function based on the measured FDR data and the computed FDR echo of successive loop section estimates obtained using the Roulette Wheel Selection mechanism. This was validated by actual FDR measurement tests on 2-wire loops and final topology results are compared with those obtained using an MMSE optimization scheme. For typical two-dimensional power line topologies, we present simulation results in a realistic channel in presence of impulse noise, using this two-step hybrid method. The aforementioned methods reuse most of the firmware modules in an embedded DSL modem, thus needing no additional equipment for measurements while ensuring rapid convergence.","doi":"10.1109/ISED.2016.7977050","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966456/7977039/07977050.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"37","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Sixth International Symposium on Embedded Computing and System Design (ISED)","publicationTitle":"2016 Sixth International Symposium on Embedded Computing and System Design (ISED)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISED.2016.7977050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7977039","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extraction of two wire and power line loop topology using customized genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7977050/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Extraction of two wire and power line loop topology using customized genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17029220","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7977050/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extraction of two wire and power line loop topology using customized genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Patna, India","sourcePdf":"07ised50a4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079984S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7966456","isNumber":"7977039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966456","xplore-issue":"7977039","articleId":"7977050","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7977052,"authors":[{"name":"N.

These standard sequence graphs are considered as Golden Execution Models, and any deviation from these models is detected as error. Three possible error models are proposed guided by the fluidic and parametric constraints of the droplet routing. Our aim is to detect any possible error, followed by minimization of these errors. The proposed heuristic tries to minimize (i) electrode usages, (ii) sample execution time/routing time, and (iii) error overhead in subsequent phases of droplet routing.

This new method involves transmitting a preamble of upto three OFDM symbols, while at the receiver a windowing technique is applied to estimate the Doppler shift post FFT. This estimated shift is used to compensate the Doppler shift of further data symbols transmitted over the channel. Simulations have been performed over an UWA multipath channel in the presence of ambient ocean noise using the proposed method, with BER as a Quality of Service parameter, studied for different Doppler shifts. Significantly, the proposed approach avoids resampling as well as the need for buffering the whole data packet before demodulation and facilitates online receiver operation for an OFDM based UWA communication system. The proposed method is easily implemented with significantly reduced computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ISED.2016.7977070","publicationTitle":"2016 Sixth International Symposium on Embedded Computing and System Design (ISED)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Sixth International Symposium on Embedded Computing and System Design (ISED)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966456/7977039/07977070.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISED.2016.7977070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7977039","startPage":"137","endPage":"141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient estimation and compensation of Doppler shift for OFDM signals in underwater communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7977070","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient estimation and compensation of Doppler shift for OFDM signals in underwater communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7977070/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"17029248","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7977070/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient estimation and compensation of Doppler shift for OFDM signals in underwater communications","confLoc":"Patna, India","sourcePdf":"27ised44a4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094278S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7966456","isNumber":"7977039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966456","xplore-issue":"7977039","articleId":"7977070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7977074,"authors":[{"name":"Pooja Yadav","affiliation":["Post Silicon Validation, Infineon Technologies India Pvt.

It is a multi stage procedure. In our work, it begins with collecting the handwriting samples on plain white A4 size paper. Preprocessing steps such as binarization and noise removal etc are performed for better recognition. Initially color image or gray scale image is taken as an input then thresholding is done to convert the image into binary image and noise removal technique is also applied. Then line segmentation, word segmentation and character segmentation have been performed. After each segmentation process, normalization techniques have been applied for normalization purpose to find out space between lines, words and letters in handwriting images. Finally, the mean of the space between all the closed loops formed by the characters has been found out and compared with the word spaces to determine the character. This paper focuses on determination of behavior based on space analysis in handwritten document. The proposed method was tested on more than 500 text image of IAM database and sample handwriting images which are written by different writers on different backgrounds, detects the exact space in between lines, words and characters before and after skew normalization of a document. The experimental result shows that proposed algorithm achieves more than 63% accuracy for all type skew angles.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Sixth International Symposium on Embedded Computing and System Design (ISED)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966456/7977039/07977084.pdf","startPage":"210","endPage":"216","publicationTitle":"2016 Sixth International Symposium on Embedded Computing and System Design (ISED)","doi":"10.1109/ISED.2016.7977084","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISED.2016.7977084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7977039","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7977084","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient method for character analysis using space in handwriting image","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Feature extraction","Databases","Noise measurement","Text analysis","Handwriting recognition","Hidden Markov models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["document image processing","feature extraction","handwriting recognition","handwritten character recognition","image colour analysis","image denoising","image segmentation","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["character analysis","handwriting image","multistage procedure","image binarization","image noise removal","image preprocessing","image recognition","color image","gray scale image","image thresholding","binary image","line segmentation","word segmentation","character segmentation","closed loops","space analysis","handwritten document","text image","IAM database","skew normalization","skew angles"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Document Image","Feature Extraction","Line Segmentation","Word Segmentation","Skew Normalization","Space Analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7977084/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"An efficient method for character analysis using space in handwriting image","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7977084/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"17029212","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient method for character analysis using space in handwriting image","confLoc":"Patna, India","sourcePdf":"41ised84a4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059837S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7966456","isNumber":"7977039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966456","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7977039","articleId":"7977084","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7977105,"authors":[{"name":"Anu Bala","affiliation":["Dept. of Computing and Comm.

Most of the spectrum occupancy measurements carried out till date are based on measurements at outdoor high points. In this work, spectrum occupancy is measured in an indoor setup. An attempt is made to find the utility of the licensed spectrum in the region of Kochi, India. For this purpose spectrum activity within the range 50MHz-4400MHz is recorded and presented as psd plots. Spectrum holes in the frequency-time domain is obtained through detailed measurement at certain frequency bands where activity is noticed. Average duty cycle of certain channels and specific bands are also analyzed. Results reveal that CRs with different complexity can work at different types of spectrum holes. This implies that a high end device with multiple protocols can adapt to any type of spectrum holes. There is also the possibility that a low end CR device specific to the type of spectrum hole can exist and perform certain specific functions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7977107/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17029244","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7977107/","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum occupancy measurement and analysis in Kochi-India from a cognitive radio perspective","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum occupancy measurement and analysis in Kochi-India from a cognitive radio perspective","confLoc":"Patna, India","sourcePdf":"64ised30a4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0729S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7966456","isNumber":"7977039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966456","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7977039","articleId":"7977107","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7977130,"authors":[{"name":"Zirije Hasani","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science University \u201cUkshin Hoti\u201d Prizren, Prizren, Kosovo"],"firstName":"Zirije","lastName":"Hasani","id":"37085998624"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6742-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-6740-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6743-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7977130","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":991},"abstract":"Most of the today's world data are streaming, time-series data, where anomalies detection gives significant information of possible critical situations. Yet, detecting anomalies in big streaming data is a difficult task, requiring detectors to acquire and process data in a real-time, as they occur, even before they are stored and instantly alarm on potential threats. Suitable to the need for real-time alarm and unsupervised procedures for massive streaming data anomaly detection, algorithms have to be robust, with low processing time, eventually at the cost of the accuracy. In this work we explore several such fast algorithms like MAD, RunMAD, Boxplot, Twitter ADVec, DBSCAN, Moving Range Technique, Statistical Control Chart Techniques, ARIMA and Moving Average. The algorithms are tested and results are visualized in the system R, on the three Numenta datasets, with known anomalies and own e-dnevnik dataset with unknown anomalies. Evaluation is done by comparing achieved results (the algorithm execution time, CPU usage and the number of anomalies found) with Numenta HTM algorithm that detects all the anomalies in their datasets. Our interest is monitoring of the streaming log data that are generating in the national educational network (e-dnevnk) that acquires a massive number of online queries and to detect anomalies in order to scale up performance, prevent network downs, alarm on possible attacks and similar.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 6th Mediterranean Conference on Embedded Computing

Transient and permanent faults occur often as a result of radiation in industrial environments. Accordingly, Fault-Tolerant (FT) FPGA-based NCSs are desired. In this paper, an NCS model is proposed composing of In-Loop and S2A architectures linked via an Ethernet switch. This architecture is used in shape detection machines with vision sensing requirements. FT techniques are applied in the controller nodes of the system along with Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) for FPGA-based controller recovery. The reliability of the system due to changes in both the recovery rate and the conditional probability of failure occurrence (either transient or permanent), is presented in this paper. Accordingly, a Markov model is constructed for reliability calculations. A case study is used to illustrate the use of such a model to choose appropriate maintenance strategies as well as a quantitative measure for the ability of the FT techniques to increase system reliability.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Transient analysis","Circuit faults","Markov processes","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerance","field programmable gate arrays","Markov processes","networked control systems","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault-tolerant FPGA-based controllers","factory automation","FPGA-based networked control systems","NCS model","shape detection machines","dynamic partial reconfiguration","conditional probability","Markov model","FT techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Dynamic Partial Configuration (DPR)","NCS","In-Loop","S2A","Reliability","Fault-Tolerance","Markov Model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7977160","doi":"10.1109/MECO.2017.7977160","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2017 6th Mediterranean Conference on Embedded Computing (MECO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 6th Mediterranean Conference on Embedded Computing (MECO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7970251/7977112/07977160.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7977112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MECO.2017.7977160","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7977160/","displayDocTitle":"Fault-Tolerant FPGA-based controllers in factory automation","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 June 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17030233","htmlLink":"/document/7977160/","conferenceDate":"11-15 June 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault-Tolerant FPGA-based controllers in factory automation","confLoc":"Bar, Montenegro","sourcePdf":"14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078824S","chronDate":"11-15 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7970251","isNumber":"7977112","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7970251","xplore-issue":"7977112","articleId":"7977160","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":7977186,"authors":[{"name":"Goran Savi\u0107","affiliation":["University of Belgrade, School of Electrical Engineering, Belgrade, Serbia"],"firstName":"Goran","lastName":"Savi\u0107","id":"37085475473"},{"name":"Milan Prokin","affiliation":["University of Belgrade, School of Electrical Engineering, Belgrade, Serbia"],"firstName":"Milan","lastName":"Prokin","id":"37332275900"},{"name":"Vladimir Rajovi\u0107","affiliation":["University of Belgrade, School of Electrical Engineering, Belgrade, Serbia"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Rajovi\u0107","id":"37074036700"},{"name":"Dragana Prokin","affiliation":["The School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of Applied Studies, Belgrade, Serbia"],"firstName":"Dragana","lastName":"Prokin","id":"37398574300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6742-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-6740-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6743-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7977186","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":18},"abstract":"This paper describes the efficient one-dimensional forward discrete wavelet transformer with 5/3 filter.

With the introduction of Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) for general purpose issues, there has been an increasing attention towards exploiting GPU processing power for deep learning algorithms. Also, large amount of data online has made possible to train deep neural networks efficiently. The aim of this paper is to perform a systematic mapping study, in order to investigate existing research about implementations of computer vision approaches based on deep learning algorithms and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We selected a total of 119 papers, which were classified according to field of interest, network type, learning paradigm, research and contribution type. Our study demonstrates that this field is a promising area for research. We choose human pose estimation in video frames as a possible computer vision task to explore in our research. After careful studying we propose three different research direction related to: improving existing CNN implementations, using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for human pose estimation and finally relying on unsupervised learning paradigm to train NNs.","doi":"10.1109/MECO.2017.7977207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MECO.2017.7977207","publicationTitle":"2017 6th Mediterranean Conference on Embedded Computing (MECO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 6th Mediterranean Conference on Embedded Computing (MECO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7970251/7977112/07977207.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7977112","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7977207/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Computer vision approaches based on deep learning and neural networks: Deep neural networks for video analysis of human pose estimation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 June 2017","accessionNumber":"17030157","htmlLink":"/document/7977207/","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer vision approaches based on deep learning and neural networks: Deep neural networks for video analysis of human pose estimation","confLoc":"Bar, Montenegro","sourcePdf":"57.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101231S","chronDate":"11-15 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7970251","isNumber":"7977112","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7970251","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7977112","articleId":"7977207","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7977246,"authors":[{"name":"Dmitry I.

With these rapid enhancements, the scale and complexity of systems providing cloud computing services have also increased tremendously. The major challenge faced by cloud service providers today is to provide an efficient, cost-effective, and reliable solution for seamless delivery of services to users. To achieve this research community is constantly working hard on different related issues like scheduling, power consumption, high availability, customer retention, resource provisioning, reliability and minimizing the probability of failures, etc. Reliability of service is an important parameter. With a large number of components in the cloud, the probability of failures is becoming a norm rather than an exception while delivering services to users. This emphasizes the need to develop fault tolerant schemes for cloud environment to deliver the required level of reliability. In this work, we have proposed a novel fault detection and mitigation approach. The novelty of approach lies in the method of detecting the fault based on running status of the job. The detection algorithm periodically monitors the progress of job on virtual machines (VMs) and reports the stalled job due to failed VM to fault tolerant manager (FTM). This not only reduces the resources wastage but ensures timely delivery of services to avoid any penalty due to service level agreement (SLA) violation. The validation of the proposed approach is done using CloudSim simulator. The performance analysis reveals the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/CIACT.2017.7977362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIACT.2017.7977362","publicationTitle":"2017 3rd International Conference on Computational Intelligence & Communication Technology (CICT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 3rd International Conference on Computational Intelligence & Communication Technology (CICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966625/7977256/07977362.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7977256","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7977362/","xploreNote":"As originally published there was a problem with this document causing the text to reflow and making it to be hard to read.

The remarkable of these new technology called femtocell improves coverage, enhances the data rate more than the macro cell. The mobile operators must always ensure an optimal network that results to quality performance of service. Thus quality of service indicates the most significant for the satisfaction of networks user, particularly for the deployment of the femtocell. Here, we focus on the deployment of femtocell through the utility function to optimise each region of deployment of the femtocell in the cellular network. The utility-based function takes into account the transmitting power of each region and the capacity of the system. This reduces interference constraint within the regions and optimises the network. Through the simulation results, we show that utility based function enhances the optimal system within the regions of the cellular network.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Utility based function for optimizing femtocells","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering and 2017 IEEE Industrial and Commercial Power Systems Europe (EEEIC / I&CPS Europe)","doi":"10.1109/EEEIC.2017.7977399","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering and 2017 IEEE Industrial and Commercial Power Systems Europe (EEEIC / I&CPS Europe)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966856/7977392/07977399.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEIC.2017.7977399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7977392","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7977399","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7977399/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Utility based function for optimizing femtocells","conferenceDate":"6-9 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7977399/","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17029886","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utility based function for optimizing femtocells","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"Paper011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075941S","chronDate":"6-9 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7966856","isNumber":"7977392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966856","xplore-issue":"7977392","articleId":"7977399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7977425,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The fundamental 50 Hz frequency component of the three stator current signals (SCSs) are estimated using three sets of modified-adaptive notch filters (M-ANFs) and the residual signals are extracted. The total harmonic signals (THSs) of the zero sequence component (ZSC) of the residual signals is then used as a new signal for fault diagnosis purpose. The dominant fundamental frequency is eliminated in the spectrum of the new diagnostic signal. This effectively results in amplification of the side bands of interest among other frequency components in the spectrum. Laboratory experiments were conducted with the motor operating at two different load conditions and test results confirm the efficacy of the proposed method in diagnosis of bar breakage.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7977434/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 June 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7977434/","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17029778","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Detection of broken rotor bars in squirrel cage induction motors by amplifying fault harmonics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of broken rotor bars in squirrel cage induction motors by amplifying fault harmonics","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"Paper070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042444S","chronDate":"6-9 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7966856","isNumber":"7977392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966856","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7977392","articleId":"7977434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7977458,"authors":[{"name":"Kamal Al Khuffash","affiliation":["Maintenance Department, GASCO, Abu Dhabi, UAE"],"firstName":"Kamal Al","lastName":"Khuffash","id":"38071526700"},{"name":"Lisa Ann Lamont","affiliation":["Power, Process and Nuclear, Mott MacDonald, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Lisa Ann","lastName":"Lamont","id":"37402173200"},{"name":"Youssef Abdel-Magid","affiliation":["Graduate School, Petroleum Institute, Abu Dhabi, UAE"],"firstName":"Youssef","lastName":"Abdel-Magid","id":"38235347200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3917-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3918-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7977458","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7977458","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Neurons","Integrated circuit modeling","Data models","Artificial neural networks","Meteorology","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","photovoltaic power systems","power system simulation","short-circuit currents","solar cell arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["renewable energy source simulation","PV panel simulation","open-circuit voltage","short-circuit current","ANN","PV simulation model accuracy enhancement","photovoltaic simulation model accuracy enhancement","artificial neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Photovoltaic","Weather","Neural Network","Solar","Simulation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EEEIC.2017.7977458","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966856/7977392/07977458.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering and 2017 IEEE Industrial and Commercial Power Systems Europe (EEEIC / I&CPS Europe)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering and 2017 IEEE Industrial and Commercial Power Systems Europe (EEEIC / I&CPS Europe)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7977392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEIC.2017.7977458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using artificial neural networks to enhance the accuracy of the photovoltaic simulation model","abstract":"This study aims to enhance the accuracy of the PV simulation model by using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to incorporate the effect of the surrounding environment in the model.

The results show that varying the values of Isc and Voc using ANNs does enhance the prediction accuracy. Therefore, it is concluded that the values of Isc and Voc should not be used as constant in the simulation of the PV panel.

The MG rapid increase implies a fast transformation of the electric power systems that are now characterized by new energy sources requiring dedicated control architectures and simulation tools. Unfortunately, the majority of such new sources are connected to the MG by means of power electronic converters that often make it impossible to replicate some of the concepts, tools and control philosophies commonly used in traditional networks. For this reason, there is a strong need of developing models for MG structures that can be reliable but sufficiently simple to be used for the control system design. In this framework, this paper presents a simplified first harmonic model for the Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM) located in the Savona Campus of the University of Genoa that allows the interface with many controllers. The developed simplified model is validated comparing it with a complete simulation performed in the PSCAD-EMTDC environment that allows to represent each component with a high level of detail.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7977392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEIC.2017.7977491","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering and 2017 IEEE Industrial and Commercial Power Systems Europe (EEEIC / I&CPS Europe)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering and 2017 IEEE Industrial and Commercial Power Systems Europe (EEEIC / I&CPS Europe)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966856/7977392/07977491.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/EEEIC.2017.7977491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simplified first harmonic model for the Savona Campus Smart Polygeneration Microgrid","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"A simplified first harmonic model for the Savona Campus Smart Polygeneration Microgrid","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7977491/","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17029765","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7977491/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simplified first harmonic model for the Savona Campus Smart Polygeneration Microgrid","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"Paper160.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065637S","chronDate":"6-9 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7966856","isNumber":"7977392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966856","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7977392","articleId":"7977491","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":7977541,"authors":[{"name":"Nor H.

In this work we focus on a hybrid wireless/narrowband PLC (WiNPLC) system for the link between smart-meter and inhome device, where multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is introduced in the narrowband powerline communication (NB-PLC) part. Our system is based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation according to IEEE 1901.2 standard where MIMO transmission allows to enhance data rate but, at the same time, requires robust detection techniques at the receiver to recover transmitted data. The performance of a 3 \u00d7 3 MIMO NB-PLC scheme over low voltage lines is evaluated. We consider different detection approaches, which are well known in the wireless domain, and assess their performance and applicability in the NB-PLC domain. Simulation results show that, similar to wireless systems, in NB-PLC non-linear MIMO detection schemes achieve better performance compared to linear ones. Additionally, complexity analysis shows that non-linear equalizers, especially maximum likelihood, have high complexity, thus limiting their applicability in real systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing the performance of WiNPLC smart grid communication with MIMO NB-PLC","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering and 2017 IEEE Industrial and Commercial Power Systems Europe (EEEIC / I&CPS Europe)","doi":"10.1109/EEEIC.2017.7977639","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering and 2017 IEEE Industrial and Commercial Power Systems Europe (EEEIC / I&CPS Europe)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966856/7977392/07977639.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEIC.2017.7977639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7977392","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7977639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7977639/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing the performance of WiNPLC smart grid communication with MIMO NB-PLC","conferenceDate":"6-9 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7977639/","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17030067","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing the performance of WiNPLC smart grid communication with MIMO NB-PLC","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"Paper375.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071608S","chronDate":"6-9 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7966856","isNumber":"7977392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966856","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7977392","articleId":"7977639","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7977660,"authors":[{"name":"Pooria Norouzi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Maslak, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Pooria","lastName":"Norouzi","id":"37086062235"},{"name":"Negar Dashti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Maslak, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Negar","lastName":"Dashti","id":"37086062364"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3917-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3918-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7977660","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surges","Surge protection","Wavelet transforms","Mathematical model","Circuit faults","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive processes","fault currents","signal processing","transient analysis","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault current discrimination","inrush current discrimination","wavelet transform","autoregressive modeling","forecasting capability","nonstationary signal analysis","system transient analysis","protection devices","internal faults","AR modeling","inrush current spectra","multiresolution analysis","MRA","decision process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AR Modeling","Wavelet Transform","Inrush current","Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA)"]}],"abstract":"Autoregressive modeling, due to its forecasting capability and Wavelet Transform with ability of non-stationary signal analysis, both seem to be proper tools to analyze the systems' transients.

In this paper, a solution to power theft using advanced metering infrastructure and intelligent algorithms has been proposed. The proposed solution profiles users based on their half hour wise power consumption data and locality. Irregularities in power usages are detected using a state-of-the-art artificially intelligent algorithm: Recurrent Neural Networks.

Optimal planning and efficient management of such resources is therefore highly necessary to alleviate their negative impacts, which increase with the penetration level. This paper deals with the optimal allocation (i.e. size and placement) of RES type DGs in coordination with reconfiguration of distribution systems (RDS). Moreover, the paper presents quantitative analysis with regards to the impacts of RDS on the integration level of such DGs in distribution systems. To this end, a tailor-made genetic algorithm (GA) based optimization model is developed. The proposed model is tested on a 16-node network system.

Many types of FCLs have been proposed to limit the magnitude of the fault current. Solid-state fault current limiters (SSFCLs) can limit the peak value of the fault current by applying several methods, such as controlling the system impedance or controlling the voltage that appears across the fault. In this paper, a new control scheme for the SSFCL circuit is presented. The control method is based on controlling the duty cycle of solid state switches to control the rms value of the system fault current. Numerical simulations using Matlab/Simulink confirm the technical features of the presented control method of SSFCL.","doi":"10.1109/EEEIC.2017.7977785","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering and 2017 IEEE Industrial and Commercial Power Systems Europe (EEEIC / I&CPS Europe)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering and 2017 IEEE Industrial and Commercial Power Systems Europe (EEEIC / I&CPS Europe)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7966856/7977392/07977785.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEIC.2017.7977785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7977392","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of solid-state fault current limiter for DG-integrated distribution systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7977785","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Control of solid-state fault current limiter for DG-integrated distribution systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 June 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7977785/","conferenceDate":"6-9 June 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17029837","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7977785/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of solid-state fault current limiter for DG-integrated distribution systems","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"Paper577.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061541S","chronDate":"6-9 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7966856","isNumber":"7977392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7966856","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7977392","articleId":"7977785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7977827,"authors":[{"name":"Mikhail Mudrov","affiliation":["CTS/UNINOVA and FCT Univ.

That is why during the FPGA-based HiL creation process it is important to select a proper number of bits for the modeled variables.

The new algorithm is designed according to the constant modulus criterion and takes full advantage of the noncircular property of the signal of interest (SOI), significantly increasing the output signal-tointerference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), enhancing the convergence speed and decreasing the steady-state misadjustment. Since it requires no known training data, the proposed algorithm saves a large amount of the available spectrum.

The difference between two schemes is the pattern of selecting pulses, which depends on the demand for the velocity information. The system, a type of frequency diverse array (FDA), takes full advantage of the phase-coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal. Furthermore, the complete discrete form of the phase-coded OFDM echoes is utilized to derive the HRRP processing. The velocity estimation in the second scheme aims to eliminate velocity ambiguity, and high velocity can be retrieved exactly. Meanwhile, the imaging method is investigated with random frequency coding applied to an array. The desired performance of resolving velocity ambiguity and suppressing noise is shown by means of comparisons with previous work. The advantages in the radar imaging and the significance of the work are concluded in the end.","doi":"10.21629/JSEE.2017.03.02","publicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/5971804/7977890/07978015.pdf","startPage":"424","endPage":"434","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7977890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.21629/JSEE.2017.03.02","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Schemes for synthesizing high-resolution range profile with extended OFDM-MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7978015","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"BIAI","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","displayDocTitle":"Schemes for synthesizing high-resolution range profile with extended OFDM-MIMO","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7978015/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17544234","volume":"28","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Schemes for synthesizing high-resolution range profile with extended OFDM-MIMO","sourcePdf":"424434.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031587S","chronDate":"June  2017","isNumber":"7977890","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971804","citationCount":"2","articleId":"7978015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"BIAI","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7978016,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Liang","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, CN"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Liang"},{"name":"Rongfang Song","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, CN"],"firstName":"Rongfang","lastName":"Song"},{"name":"Fei Li","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, CN"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Xueyun He","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, CN"],"firstName":"Xueyun","lastName":"He"},{"name":"Lihua Yang","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, CN"],"firstName":"Lihua","lastName":"Yang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1004-4132"}],"articleNumber":"7978016","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":28},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Beijing Institute of Aerospace Information (BIAI)","url":"#"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel estimation","Estimation","Training","Frequency estimation","Receivers","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","iterative methods","OFDM modulation","radio transceivers","transient response","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct-conversion transceivers","radio frequency impairments","channel impulse responses","decoupled estimation scheme","frequency-dependent IQI","wireless channel","generalized channel model","iterative estimation scheme","channel variation","joint estimation schemes","OFDM systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","channel estimation schemes","in-phase and quadrature-phase imbalance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["direct-conversion transceivers","frequency-dependent in-phase and quadrature-phase imbalance (IQI)","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","decoupled estimation"]}],"abstract":"The in-phase and quadrature-phase imbalance (IQI) is one of the major radio frequency impairments existing in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems with direct-conversion transceivers. During the transmission of the communication signal, the impact of IQI is coupled with channel impulse responses (CIR), which makes the traditional channel estimation schemes ineffective. A decoupled estimation scheme is proposed to separately estimate the frequency-dependent IQI and wireless channel. Firstly, the generalized channel model is built to separate the parameters of IQI and wireless channel. Then an iterative estimation scheme of frequency-dependent IQI is designed at the initial stage of communication. Finally, based on the estimation result of IQI, the least square algorithm is utilized to estimate the channel-related parameters at each time of channel variation. Compared with the joint estimation schemes of IQI and channel, the proposed decoupled estimation scheme requires much lower training overhead at each time of channel variation. Simulation results demonstrate the good estimation performance of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.21629/JSEE.2017.03.03","publicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/5971804/7977890/07978016.pdf","startPage":"435","endPage":"441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7977890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.21629/JSEE.2017.03.03","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoupled estimation of frequency-dependent IQI and channel for OFDM systems with direct-conversion transceivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7978016","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"BIAI","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","displayDocTitle":"Decoupled estimation of frequency-dependent IQI and channel for OFDM systems with direct-conversion transceivers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7978016/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17559987","volume":"28","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Decoupled estimation of frequency-dependent IQI and channel for OFDM systems with direct-conversion transceivers","sourcePdf":"435441.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032456S","chronDate":"June  2017","isNumber":"7977890","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971804","articleId":"7978016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"BIAI","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7978017,"authors":[{"name":"Haosu Zhou","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Haosu","lastName":"Zhou"},{"name":"Jianxin Wang","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Jianxin","lastName":"Wang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1004-4132"}],"articleNumber":"7978017","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Beijing Institute of Aerospace Information (BIAI)","url":"#"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7978017","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial intelligence","Marine vehicles","Modulation","Measurement","Viterbi algorithm","Complexity theory","Doppler shift"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","maximum likelihood estimation","satellite communication","signal detection","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["satellite-based automatic identification system","white Gaussian noise channel","state-complexity reduction","noncoherent sequence detection scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["non-coherent sequence detection scheme","satellite-based automatic identification system","frequency offset","messages collision","Viterbi decoder"]}],"abstract":"The satellite-based automatic identification system (AIS) receiver has to encounter the frequency offset caused by the Doppler effect and the oscillator instability. This paper proposes a non-coherent sequence detection scheme for the satellite-based AIS signal transmitted over the white Gaussian noise channel. Based on the maximum likelihood estimation and a Viterbi decoder, the proposed scheme is capable of tolerating a frequency offset up to 5% of the symbol rate. The complexity of the proposed scheme is reduced by the state-complexity reduction, which is based on per-survivor processing. Simulation results prove that the proposed non-coherent sequence detection scheme has high robustness to frequency offset compared to the relative scheme when messages collision exists.","doi":"10.21629/JSEE.2017.03.04","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.21629/JSEE.2017.03.04","startPage":"442","endPage":"448","publicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/5971804/7977890/07978017.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7977890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-coherent sequence detection scheme for satellite-based automatic identification system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"BIAI","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7978017/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Non-coherent sequence detection scheme for satellite-based automatic identification system","volume":"28","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17544235","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Non-coherent sequence detection scheme for satellite-based automatic identification system","sourcePdf":"442448.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053909S","chronDate":"June  2017","isNumber":"7977890","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971804","articleId":"7978017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"BIAI","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7978018,"authors":[{"name":"Xingbin Tu","affiliation":["Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, CN"],"firstName":"Xingbin","lastName":"Tu"},{"name":"Xiaomei Xu","affiliation":["Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, CN"],"firstName":"Xiaomei","lastName":"Xu"},{"name":"Zheguang Zou","affiliation":["Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, CN"],"firstName":"Zheguang","lastName":"Zou"},{"name":"Liangliang Yang","affiliation":["Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, CN"],"firstName":"Liangliang","lastName":"Yang"},{"name":"Jianming Wu","affiliation":["Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, CN"],"firstName":"Jianming","lastName":"Wu"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1004-4132"}],"articleNumber":"7978018","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":264},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Beijing Institute of Aerospace Information (BIAI)","url":"#"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7978018","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency modulation","Chirp","Underwater acoustics","Bandwidth","Frequency-domain analysis","Spread spectrum communication","Frequency conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chirp modulation","Fourier transforms","frequency hop communication","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater acoustic frequency-hopped communications","fractional Fourier domain hopped communication method","frequency hopping","underwater acoustic communication channels","underwater acoustic channels","multiple chirp shift keying-FrFD hopping","chirp modulation","FrFD frequency","acoustic communications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["underwater acoustic communication","fractional Fourier domain (FrFD)","frequency hopping","chirp signal"]}],"abstract":"To improve the data rate of underwater acoustic frequency-hopped communications, frequency hopping is applied to different orders of fractional Fourier domain (FrFD), to enable non-intrusive, bandwidth-limited acoustic communications. An FrFD frequency-hopped communication method based on chirp modulation, namely multiple chirp shift keying-FrFD hopping (MCSK-FrFDH), is proposed for underwater acoustic channels. Validated by both simulations and experimental results, this method can reach a bandwidth efficiency twice more than conventional frequency-hopped methods with the same data rate and anti-multipath capability, suggesting that the proposed method achieves a better performance than the traditional frequencyhopped communication in underwater acoustic communication channels.

Particularly, the parameterized time-frequency analysis (PTFA) shows great potential in processing such nonstationary signals. Five procedures for the PTFA are proposed to separate the overlapped multi-radar signal, including initiation, instantaneous frequency estimation with PTFA, signal demodulation, signal separation with adaptive filter and signal recovery.

Research on modeling and simulation of the BMDS beforehand is essential as developing a real one requires lots of manpower and resources. BMDS is a typical complex system for its nonlinear, adaptive and uncertainty characteristics. The agent-based modeling method is well suited for the complex system whose overall behaviors are determined by interactions among individual elements. A multi-agent decision support system (DSS), which includes missile agent, radar agent and command center agent, is established based on the studies of structure and function of BMDS. Considering the constraints brought by radar, intercept missile, offensive missile and commander, the objective function of DSS is established. In order to dynamically generate the optimal interception plan, the variable neighborhood negative selection particle swarm optimization (VNNSPSO) algorithm is proposed to support the decision making of DSS. The proposed algorithm is compared with the standard PSO, constriction factor PSO (CFPSO), inertia weight linear decrease PSO (LDPSO), variable neighborhood PSO (VNPSO) algorithm from the aspects of convergence rate, iteration number, average fitness value and standard deviation. The simulation results verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

Aiming at this problem, an environment model is established using the search map, and the updating method of the search map is extended by considering the sensing capabilities of the moving targets. A multi-UAV search path planning optimization model based on the model predictive control (MPC) method is constructed, and a hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm with a crossover operator is designed to solve the model.

Since using recoil force is a common method to the arm fuze, its dynamic simulation test has always been the focus of the fuze test research. A new fuze recoil environmental simulation method is proposed based on the electromagnetic launcher. Then the trigger control characteristics of the fuze recoil simulation system and the influence of the trigger position on the recoil force are studied. The results of the study show that although the pulse width of the armature force curve can be changed by adjusting the trigger position, due to the limit of the range, there also exists the contradiction that the electromagnetic pulse width gets narrow with the increase of electromagnetic force peak. Thus, it cannot meet the requirements of the fuze launch recoil simulation. In order to make the recoil force close to the actual environment, the multi-stage trigger control characteristics are analyzed, and the influence of trigger position on recoil environmental force characteristics is studied. Then a fuze launch recoil environmental simulation platform is established and continuous electromagnetic force is achieved by using the trigger strategy. Finally, the experiment is performed to simulate the fuze launch recoil environment and show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed theoretical analysis. The major research work of this paper includes studying the composition and basic principle of the simulation system, establishing a launch model to analyze the single-stage and multi-stage coil fuze launch recoil characteristics, designing the test device to verify the correctness and validity of the research. This paper draws the conclusions that the feasibility of the fuze launch environmental simulation based on the electromagnetic launcher is verified, the trigger position has a great influence on force peak continuity, the problems of low maximum overload peak and short peak duration in the multi-stage coil fuze launch environmental simulation can be effectively solved through adjusting the trigger position, the system has creative and extensive application prospects.","doi":"10.21629/JSEE.2017.03.16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.21629/JSEE.2017.03.16","startPage":"563","endPage":"571","publicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/5971804/7977890/07978029.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7977890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trigger control characteristics of fuze-recoil simulation system based on electromagnetic launcher","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"BIAI","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7978029/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Trigger control characteristics of fuze-recoil simulation system based on electromagnetic launcher","volume":"28","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17526566","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Trigger control characteristics of fuze-recoil simulation system based on electromagnetic launcher","sourcePdf":"563571.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024962S","chronDate":"June  2017","isNumber":"7977890","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971804","citationCount":"4","articleId":"7978029","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"BIAI","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7978030,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Zhao","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Electronic System Engineering, Beijing 100854, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Zhao"},{"name":"Guangyu Du","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Electronic System Engineering, Beijing 100854, China"],"firstName":"Guangyu","lastName":"Du"},{"name":"Bin Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Electronic System Engineering, Beijing 100854, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Yanbin Zhai","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Electronic System Engineering, Beijing 100854, China"],"firstName":"Yanbin","lastName":"Zhai"},{"name":"Yuruo Shi","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Electronic System Engineering, Beijing 100854, China"],"firstName":"Yuruo","lastName":"Shi"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1004-4132"}],"articleNumber":"7978030","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":225},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Beijing Institute of Aerospace Information (BIAI)","url":"#"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Atmospheric modeling","Antennas","Scattering","Object oriented modeling","Mathematical model","Missiles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzes (detonation)","military computing","missiles","weapons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["warhead dynamic effectiveness power field algorithm","general fuze model","FWS simulation system","warhead fragments","complex fuze antennas","sea echo model","simulation system framework","low altitude flight","air defense missile","fuze warhead system","simulation design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fuze warhead system (FWS)","simulation","fuze warhead matching","sea echo","fragment trajectory drifting"]}],"abstract":"A novel simulation method for fuze warhead system (FWS) at very low altitude flight is proposed to solve adaptability issues of the traditional one in the naval battle.

Traditional models usually partition the global universe of discourse, which is not appropriate for all objectives. For example, the universe of the secular trend model is continuously variational. In addition, most forecasting methods rely on prior information, i.e., fuzzy relationship groups (FRG). Numerous relationship groups lead to the explosive growth of relationship library in a linear model and increase the computational complexity. To overcome problems above and ascertain an appropriate order, an intuitionistic fuzzy time series forecasting model based on order decision and adaptive partition algorithm is proposed. By forecasting the vector operator matrix, the proposed model can adjust partitions and intervals adaptively. The proposed model is tested on student enrollments of Alabama dataset, typical seasonal dataset Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX) and a secular trend dataset of total retail sales for social consumer goods in China.

The degraded hazy images may have substantial negative impact on most computer vision systems. Thus image haze removal is of the practical significance in engineering. This paper proposes a fast and effective single image haze removal algorithm on the basis of the physics imaging model. To extract the global atmospheric light accurately, we exploit multiple prior rules underlying hazy images, and put forward a novel measurement to judge the likelihood that a pixel is regarded as the global atmospheric light. In addition, the rough transmission map is estimated through a multiscale fusion process based on the Laplace pyramid transform, and refined by a total variation model. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method outperforms most of the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the dehazing quality, and achieves a trade-off between the computational efficiency and haze removal capability.","doi":"10.21629/JSEE.2017.03.19","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.21629/JSEE.2017.03.19","startPage":"597","endPage":"605","publicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/5971804/7977890/07978032.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7977890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image haze removal via multiscale fusion and total variation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"BIAI","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7978032/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Image haze removal via multiscale fusion and total variation","volume":"28","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17559997","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Image haze removal via multiscale fusion and total variation","sourcePdf":"597605.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02839S","chronDate":"June  2017","isNumber":"7977890","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971804","citationCount":"1","articleId":"7978032","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"BIAI","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7978033,"authors":[{"name":"Yunxiang Chen","affiliation":["Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Yunxiang","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Qiang Zhang","affiliation":["Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Zhongyi Cai","affiliation":["Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Zhongyi","lastName":"Cai"},{"name":"Lili Wang","affiliation":["Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Lili","lastName":"Wang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1004-4132"}],"articleNumber":"7978033","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Beijing Institute of Aerospace Information (BIAI)","url":"#"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Missiles","Degradation","Testing","Reliability","Correlation","Numerical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["failure analysis","life testing","missiles","reliability","state-space methods","stochastic processes","Weibull distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["storage reliability assessment model","SR assessment model","storage failure feature","voltage testing data","state space model","missile degradation state","missile degradation degree","time-scale model","degradation failure model","proportional risk model","outburst failure model","competition failure model","multicomponent degradation data","missile life profile analysis","characteristics voltage","Wiener process","Weibull distribution","performance degradation effect","periodical testing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["competition failure model","storage reliability (SR)","missile degradation degree (DD)","proportional risk model","individual variability"]}],"abstract":"The degradation data of multi-components in missile is derived by periodical testing. How to use these data to assess the storage reliability (SR) of the whole missile is a difficult problem in current research. An SR assessment model based on competition failure of multi-components in missile is proposed. By analyzing the missile life profile and its storage failure feature, the key components in missile are obtained and the characteristics voltage is assumed to be its key performance parameter. When the voltage testing data of key components in missile are available, a state space model (SSM) is applied to obtain the whole missile degradation state, which is defined as the missile degradation degree (DD). A Wiener process with the time-scale model (TSM) is applied to build the degradation failure model with individual variability and nonlinearity. The Weibull distribution and proportional risk model are applied to build an outburst failure model with performance degradation effect. Furthermore, a competition failure model with the correlation between degradation failure and outburst failure is proposed. A numerical example with a set of missiles in storage is analyzed to demonstrate the accuracy and superiority of the proposed model.","doi":"10.21629/JSEE.2017.03.20","publicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/5971804/7977890/07978033.pdf","startPage":"606","endPage":"616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7977890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.21629/JSEE.2017.03.20","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Storage reliability assessment model based on competition failure of multi-components in missile","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7978033","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"BIAI","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","displayDocTitle":"Storage reliability assessment model based on competition failure of multi-components in missile","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7978033/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17559998","volume":"28","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Storage reliability assessment model based on competition failure of multi-components in missile","sourcePdf":"606616.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022992S","chronDate":"June  2017","isNumber":"7977890","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971804","articleId":"7978033","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"BIAI","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7978034,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaolong Xu","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, CN"],"firstName":"Xiaolong","lastName":"Xu"},{"name":"Xinxin Liu","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, CN"],"firstName":"Xinxin","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Xiaoxiao Liu","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, CN"],"firstName":"Xiaoxiao","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Yanfei Sun","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, CN"],"firstName":"Yanfei","lastName":"Sun"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1004-4132"}],"articleNumber":"7978034","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Beijing Institute of Aerospace Information (BIAI)","url":"#"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Reliability","Internet","Telecommunications","Big Data","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","Internet","sensor fusion","text analysis","Web sites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["source reliability","fact accuracy","TFAEA","typical truth finder algorithms","entity attributes","data conflict solution","big data","accurate data","efficient data","current truth finder algorithms","low accuracy","Internet","data quality","interactive degree","one-way text similarity","factual conflict","mutual support degree","data source symmetric saturation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["truth finder","data reliability","entity attribute","data conflict"]}],"abstract":"The Internet now is a large-scale platform with big data. Finding truth from a huge dataset has attracted extensive attention, which can maintain the quality of data collected by users and provide users with accurate and efficient data. However, current truth finder algorithms are unsatisfying, because of their low accuracy and complication. This paper proposes a truth finder algorithm based on entity attributes (TFAEA). Based on the iterative computation of source reliability and fact accuracy, TFAEA considers the interactive degree among facts and the degree of dependence among sources, to simplify the typical truth finder algorithms. In order to improve the accuracy of them, TFAEA combines the one-way text similarity and the factual conflict to calculate the mutual support degree among facts. Furthermore, TFAEA utilizes the symmetric saturation of data sources to calculate the degree of dependence among sources. The experimental results show that TFAEA is not only more stable, but also more accurate than the typical truth finder algorithms.","doi":"10.21629/JSEE.2017.03.21","publicationTitle":"Journal of

Weighting function parameters are defined in a relatively narrow range according to actual operating feature of AMB systems. Then, based on these priori information, such as search-domain and weights expression, tuning and optimizing of the design performance function is carried out applying a MOGA. The control strategy avoids time consuming task in the progress of tuning parameters and provides a complete and versatile method to obtain weighting functions for a H\u221e controller.

Second, by constructing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and using the so-called Wirtinger-based integral inequality to estimate its derivative, a delay-range-dependent and delay-rate-dependent criterion is presented to ensure the filtering error dynamic system to be exponentially stable and passive with an expected dissipation. Third, since the criterion is presented in the form of linear matrix inequalities with nonlinear constraints, a cone complementarity linearization algorithm is proposed to solve the nonlinear problem.

To reduce the dimension of features, we propose a new way of feature screening in this paper. The improved clustering algorithm is employed to screen the features preliminarily, and then the genetic algorithm synergistically combined with the random forest is cascaded to screen the features deeply. To validate the way feasible, 1588 tobacco leaves belonging to 41 grades are used to be classified in the experiments. The results show that both the recognition rate and the speed can be improved. This demonstrates that the presented cascaded screening approach can raise not only the recognition rate but also the speed because the feature dimension is decreasing effectively.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978136","startPage":"452","endPage":"455","publicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7978054","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7961861/7978054/07978136.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep feature of image screened by improved clustering algorithm cascaded with genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7978136/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Deep feature of image screened by improved clustering algorithm cascaded with genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7978136/","accessionNumber":"17041827","publicationDate":"May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep feature of image screened by improved clustering algorithm cascaded with genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"RP081SunA143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044903S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7961861","isNumber":"7978054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7961861","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7978054","articleId":"7978136","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7978154,"authors":[{"name":"Zengrui Yang","affiliation":["Automation College, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Zengrui","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086177535"},{"name":"Qichang Duan","affiliation":["Automation College, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Qichang","lastName":"Duan","id":"37273377000"},{"name":"Jiamiao Zhong","affiliation":["Automation College, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Jiamiao","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37086179734"},{"name":"Mingxuan Mao","affiliation":["Automation College, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Mingxuan","lastName":"Mao","id":"37085663623"},{"name":"Zhili Xun","affiliation":["CRRC Yongji Electric Co., Ltd, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhili","lastName":"Xun","id":"37086173402"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4657-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-4656-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4658-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"7978154","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":695},"abstract":"The power-voltage (P-V) characteristic curve of photovoltaic (PV) system have nonlinear and multiple peaks characteristics under partial shading condition.

appears to be a promising maintenance strategy which can enhance reliability and reduce maintenance costs of the target system. In the process of PHM, Prognostics is the most important and crucial. Prognostic approaches can be roughly divided into two categories: model-based methods and data-driven methods, both of which have advantages and limitations. To overcome the limitations of these methods and improve the accuracy and precision of the forecasting, we propose a novel fusion prognostic method. This method fuses the Particle Filter (PF, model-based) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM, data-driven) algorithms. In the literature, PF is used by estimating the system state and identifying the parameters of the model for the purpose of Prognostic. However, it does not have ideal performance due to the lack of measurements in the prediction phase. To solve this problem, LSTM is used to forecast the measurements and use the results as the observation of PF. The experiment is applied to the data of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell Stack from IEEE PHM 2014 Data Challenge. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively integrate the advantages of PF and LSTM, which leads to a better forecasting performance than naive PF approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7978172/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2017","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7978172/","accessionNumber":"17041489","displayDocTitle":"A particle filter and long short term memory fusion algorithm for failure prognostic of proton exchange membrane fuel cells","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A particle filter and long short term memory fusion algorithm for failure prognostic of proton exchange membrane fuel cells","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"RP1015TueB106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.12698S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7961861","isNumber":"7978054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7961861","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7978054","articleId":"7978172","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7978181,"authors":[{"name":"Fulai Liu","affiliation":["Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning","Northeastern University at Qinhuangdao, Qinhuangdao, Hebei"],"firstName":"Fulai","lastName":"Liu","id":"37401759600"},{"name":"Junjiao Ma","affiliation":["Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning"],"firstName":"Junjiao","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085996593"},{"name":"Ruiyan Du","affiliation":["Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning","Northeastern University at Qinhuangdao, Qinhuangdao, Hebei"],"firstName":"Ruiyan","lastName":"Du","id":"37400014000"},{"name":"Jian Wu","affiliation":["Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085623443"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4657-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-4656-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4658-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"7978181","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7978181","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Graph theory","Wireless networks","Dynamic spectrum access","Heuristic algorithms","Mathematical model","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","graph theory","matrix algebra","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ICSGC-based dynamic spectrum access algorithm","cognitive radio","CR system","idle spectrum resources","multiuser dynamic spectrum access","improved color sensitive graph coloring model","cognitive user power matrix","interference threshold matrix constraint","color-sensitive graph-based coloring model","interference quantization","design access criterion","system throughput","optimal spectrum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spectrum access","Graph theory","Channel selection","Power control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978181","publicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7961861/7978054/07978181.pdf","startPage":"5692","endPage":"5697","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7978054","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ICSGC-based dynamic spectrum access algorithm for cognitive radio","abstract":"The dynamic spectrum access, as one of the core technologies of Cognitive Radio (CR) system is an important step for users to realize the utilization of idle spectrum resources.

In this algorithm, the cognitive user power matrix and the interference threshold matrix constraint are added to the color-sensitive graph-based coloring model to achieve the effective control of the cognitive user power and the quantization of the interference between the cognitive users. Based on this, this paper design access criterion with the purpose of maximizing throughput of system, and then obtained optimal spectrum by using color-sensitive coloring theory, thus achieve multi-user dynamic spectrum access.

The salient feature also lies in its low complexity in computation and effectiveness in dealing with modeling uncertainties and nonlinearities as well as actuation faults.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive fault-tolerant control of MIMO nonlinear systems","publicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978243","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7961861/7978054/07978243.pdf","startPage":"590","endPage":"595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7978054","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7978243","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7978243/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive fault-tolerant control of MIMO nonlinear systems","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7978243/","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17040873","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive fault-tolerant control of MIMO nonlinear systems","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"RP108SunAIS06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071086S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7961861","isNumber":"7978054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7961861","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7978054","articleId":"7978243","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7978249,"authors":[{"name":"Funa Zhou","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Engineering, Henan University, Kaifeng, China"],"firstName":"Funa","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085997265"},{"name":"Po Hu","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Engineering, Henan University, Kaifeng, China"],"firstName":"Po","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085574701"},{"name":"Xiaoliang Feng","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Henan University of Technology, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoliang","lastName":"Feng","id":"37086002125"},{"name":"Yansui Song","affiliation":["College of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnic University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Yansui","lastName":"Song","id":"37086001681"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4657-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-4656-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4658-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"7978249","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":185},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Path planning","Aircraft","Reconnaissance","Heuristic algorithms","Optimization","Aerospace control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","mobile robots","path planning","telerobotics","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Prim algorithm","UAV path planning","weight matrix","coordinate transformation","cruise sequence","cruise path planning","UAV cruise system","unmanned aerial vehicle"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UAV","path planning","Prim algorithm","coordinate transformation"]}],"abstract":"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can perform tasks such as military reconnaissance, monitoring, search and target pointing. When a UAV is used to perform a reconnaissance task on a cruise path planning, and certain set of multi-target point, the optimal cruise path should be well scheduled to ensure that the cruise time is minimal. In this paper, an improved Prim algorithm is studied by introducing constraint condition to improve the effect of UAV path planning. Based on the data provided by GPS module, the weight matrix between the target points is obtained by using coordinate transformation, and the optimal cruise sequence is obtained by using the improved Prim algorithm. Simulation results and success application in cruise path planning of UAV show the efficiency of this improved Prim algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978249","publicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7961861/7978054/07978249.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7978054","startPage":"6022","endPage":"6027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved prim algorithm and its application in unmanned aerial vehicle cruise system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7978249","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improved prim algorithm and its application in unmanned aerial vehicle cruise system","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7978249/","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17041671","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7978249/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved prim algorithm and its application in unmanned aerial vehicle cruise system","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"RP1085TueBIS32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062665S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7961861","isNumber":"7978054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7961861","xplore-issue":"7978054","articleId":"7978249","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7978287,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Guoxin","affiliation":["Training Department, Shenyang Artillery Academy, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Guoxin","id":"37564562800"},{"name":"Tong Xin","affiliation":["Institute of Scientific & Technical Information of Liaoning Province, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Xin","id":"38191523300"},{"name":"Pan Wei","affiliation":["Training Department, Shenyang Artillery Academy, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Pan","lastName":"Wei","id":"37956337800"},{"name":"Ren Tao","affiliation":["Software College, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Ren","lastName":"Tao","id":"37086187899"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4657-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-4656-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4658-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"7978287","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7978287","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Chaos","Sociology","Statistics","Optimization","Clustering algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","genetic algorithms","jamming","pattern classification","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clustering classification","chaos microvariation adaptive genetic algorithm","radio fuze jamming","selection operator","rank-based fitness assignment","elitist model","crossover operator","mutation operator","adaptive crossover probability","adaptive mutation probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["adaptive genetic algorithm","cluster analysis","crossover probability","mutation probability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978287","pdfPath":"/iel7/7961861/7978054/07978287.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","startPage":"616","endPage":"620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7978054","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clustering analysis based on chaos micro variation adaptive genetic algorithm for radio fuze jamming","abstract":"To improve the accuracy of clustering classification the Adaptive Genetic Algorithm was proposed.

While not much attention had been paid to the issue of anomaly detection for PCSs, which may be the main factor that prevents practical applications of these methods. This paper proposed a general anomaly detection method for online identifying anomalies mixed among process data of PCSs. Converting the issue of anomaly detection to one-class classification (OCC) can remit the absence of anomalies in PCSs. Exploiting the thought of ensemble can provide a more general solution for varying PCSs. Experimental results prove the effectiveness and applicableness of the proposed method and its ability to outperform state-of-the-art algorithms for detecting anomalies for PCSs.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978360","startPage":"6589","endPage":"6592","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7961861/7978054/07978360.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7978054","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ensemble one-class classification applied for anomaly detection in process control systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pollution measurement","Training","Process control","Data models","Furnaces","Steel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","process control","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ensemble one-class classification","process control systems","PCS","general anomaly detection method","online identifying anomalies","OCC","advanced control methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["anomaly detection","one-class classification","ensemble","process control system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7978360/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Ensemble one-class classification applied for anomaly detection in process control systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7978360/","publicationDate":"May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2017","accessionNumber":"17041105","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ensemble one-class classification applied for anomaly detection in process control systems","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"RP1186TueC134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043728S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7961861","isNumber":"7978054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7961861","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7978054","articleId":"7978360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7978374,"authors":[{"name":"Libo Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Control and Systems Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing"],"firstName":"Libo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086064058"},{"name":"Qijian Fu","affiliation":["Department of Control and Systems Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing"],"firstName":"Qijian","lastName":"Fu","id":"37086179982"},{"name":"Jiao Chen","affiliation":["Department of Control and Systems Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing"],"firstName":"Jiao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086175936"},{"name":"Han Bai","affiliation":["Department of Control and Systems Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing"],"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Bai","id":"37086142952"},{"name":"Xianzhong Zhou","affiliation":["Research Center for New Technology in Intelligent Equipment, Nanjing University, Nanjing"],"firstName":"Xianzhong","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37406427000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4657-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-4656-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4658-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"7978374","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sociology","Statistics","Particle swarm optimization","Convergence","Benchmark testing","Optimization","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","minimax techniques","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","CPSODE","local minima problem","PSO algorithm","cooperation algorithm","differential evolution","cooperation mechanism","search agents"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Differential evolution","PSO-DE algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7978374","abstract":"To solve the local minima problem of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, a novel cooperation algorithm called CPSODE is proposed.

Due to dramatic changes and shorter collection intervals in wind speed, it generates a larger numbers of samples, which affects modeling time and accuracy. Therefore, a short-term wind speed prediction method based on active learning with sample selection is proposed. The main objective of active learning is to collect training samples by minimizing the error of the prediction process while minimizing the number of training samples used. First the initial training set is selected, then selecting the sample with higher Euclidean distance adding to the training set and delete the samples with lower cross-validation error. Finally, the establishment of support vector machine model and neural network model to predict the results of comparison. Taking a wind farm in Jiangsu Province as the actual experimental data, simulation results show that this method can ensure the prediction accuracy, while effectively reducing the number of training samples.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7978054","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978387","publicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7961861/7978054/07978387.pdf","startPage":"6717","endPage":"6720","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978387","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective sampling using active learning for short-term wind speed prediction","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Selective sampling using active learning for short-term wind speed prediction","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7978387/","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17041129","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7978387/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective sampling using active learning for short-term wind speed prediction","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"RP1210TueC174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057069S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7961861","isNumber":"7978054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7961861","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7978054","articleId":"7978387","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7978416,"authors":[{"name":"Youlin Yang","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Bohai University, Jinzhou, China"],"firstName":"Youlin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37899924700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4657-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-4656-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4658-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"7978416","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":249},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7978416","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptation models","Adaptive systems","Induction motors","Rotors","Estimation","Biological neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["angular velocity control","induction motors","model reference adaptive control systems","neurocontrollers","PI control","sensorless machine control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network model reference adaptive system","speed estimation","sensorless induction motor","neural network identifier","rotor flux","voltage model","winding resistance","mutual inductance","single-neuron adaptive algorithm","PI regulation algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Model Reference Adaptive System","Neural Network","Speed Estimation","Sensorless Induction Motor"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978416","pdfPath":"/iel7/7961861/7978054/07978416.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","startPage":"6864","endPage":"6868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7978054","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network model reference adaptive system for speed estimation of sensorless induction motor","abstract":"A neural network model reference adaptive system is designed for speed estimation of sensorless induction motor.

coordinated attitude tracking control for spacecraft formation based on neural networks","abstract":"This paper investigates the distributed attitude tracking control problem of spacecraft formation under a directed communication topology. A distributed coordinated attitude tracking control law based on neural networks is introduced to deal with the uncertainties and external disturbances when the time-varying leader's trajectory is available to only a subset of follower spacecraft. A Lyapunov analysis guarantees the convergence of attitude tracking errors to an arbitrarily small domain. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7978481/","accessionNumber":"17041388","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7978481/","publicationDate":"May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Distributed coordinated attitude tracking control for spacecraft formation based on neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed coordinated attitude tracking control for spacecraft formation based on neural networks","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"RP1296TueD051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084113S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7961861","isNumber":"7978054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7961861","xplore-issue":"7978054","articleId":"7978481","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7978606,"authors":[{"name":"Ma Liangyu","affiliation":["Department of Automation, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Ma","lastName":"Liangyu","id":"38531472400"},{"name":"Cao Pengrui","affiliation":["Department of Automation, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Cao","lastName":"Pengrui","id":"37086010857"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4657-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-4656-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4658-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"7978606","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7978606","abstract":"With the widespread implementation of Automatic Generation Control (AGC) in regional power grids, large-capacity supercritical and ultra-supercritical (SC/USC) power units are required to participate in peak load regulation frequently and often operate under wide-scope variable load conditions. Since a SC boiler unit is a MIMO strong coupling system with nonlinearity and large time delay characteristics, the traditional coordinated control strategy based on PID controllers often cannot meet the requirements with slow load response and large steam pressure fluctuations. Therefore, a model predictive optimal control (MPOC) scheme is proposed for the coordinated system control of a supercritical power unit on the basis of an improved firefly algorithm (FA) and neural network modeling. The MPOC scheme is programmed with MATLAB software and implemented in the full-scope simulator of a 600MW supercritical power unit. The test results show that the method can greatly improve the load response speed and keep the main steam pressure within safety limits.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978606","startPage":"774","endPage":"779","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference

Through the strategy of real coded for the weighted matrices Q and R, the best weighted matrices and the feedback matrix K can be obtained. By simulation analysis of the selected system, the results showed that a better effect is obtained based on the DEA to optimize the weighed matrices of the LQR.

The model based on control algorithms may not obtain satisfied BG values if the prediction model of BG is mismatched. One of the challenges in glucose control is the lacking of accurate individual prediction models for T1DM patients because of limited modeling data. In order to solve this problem, in this paper, a rapid and economic modeling method in T1DM is first pointed out for glucose control. Using the idea of model migration with PSO, the ARX model structure is adaptively adjusted from person to person with limited data individually. Then the developed prediction model is used for glucose control using the zone model predictive control with the control-relevant constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested on the UVa/Padova metabolic simulator. It is shown that the proposed method has good control performance where 95% of the simulation time for glucose control can be regulated within the normal range. Further, the experimental results show that there are no statistically significant differences between the individual ARX model with sufficient data and the developed prediction model using paired t-test. The proposed glucose control method is effective and economic which can take place of repetitive subject-dependent control method especially when the modeling data are insufficient.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7978655/","accessionNumber":"17041011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7978655/","publicationDate":"May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Blood glucose control based on rapid model identification with particle swarm optimization method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blood glucose control based on rapid model identification with particle swarm optimization method","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"RP171SunB024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077065S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7961861","isNumber":"7978054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7961861","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7978054","articleId":"7978655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7978672,"authors":[{"name":"Dongxuan Li","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Automatic Control System (Beijing Institute of Technology), Beijing, P.

Firstly, the video frames are segmented into super-pixels and then super-pixels of foreground are then selected according to their pixel ratios of foreground. Secondly, to enhance the temporal relation of super-pixel features, the mean value of multi-scale histogram of optical flow of super-pixels among adjacent frames which matched with the current super-pixels based on the gray-level histogram is taken as the feature for detection. Finally, the sparse combination learning algorithm is adopted to detect abnormality in the videos. The experiments show that the algorithm can reliably detect and locate anomalies in UCSD and UMN video libraries.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7961861/7978054/07978723.pdf","startPage":"1329","endPage":"1334","publicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978723","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7978054","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7978723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly detection based on super-pixels time context feature","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Image motion analysis","Computer vision","Histograms","Testing","Adaptive optics","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","feature extraction","image enhancement","image motion analysis","image segmentation","image sequences","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","super-pixels time context feature","UMN video libraries","UCSD video libraries","video abnormality detection","sparse combination learning algorithm","feature detection","optical flow","super-pixel feature enhancement","video frames segmentation","temporal motion information","moving object consistency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly Detection","Super-Pixels","Time Context Feature","Sparse Combination Learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7978723/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly detection based on super-pixels time context feature","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7978723/","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17041912","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly detection based on super-pixels time context feature","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"RP239SunB136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061885S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7961861","isNumber":"7978054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7961861","xplore-issue":"7978054","articleId":"7978723","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7978732,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenhao Tang","affiliation":["College of Automation Engineering, Northeast Electric Power University, Jilin"],"firstName":"Zhenhao","lastName":"Tang","id":"37086029697"},{"name":"Haiyang Zhang","affiliation":["College of Automation Engineering, Northeast Electric Power University, Jilin"],"firstName":"Haiyang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085852881"},{"name":"Hui Yang","affiliation":["Xin Xiang Dream Power CO., LTD, XinXiang"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086046598"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4657-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-4656-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4658-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"7978732","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Genetic algorithms","Boilers","Prediction algorithms","Atmospheric measurements","Pollution measurement","Atmospheric modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","boilers","combustion","flue gases","genetic algorithms","neural nets","oxygen","power engineering computing","power plants","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural networks model","oxygen content prediction","flue gas","power plant","boiler combustion process","soft measurement method","back-propagation neural network","BPNN","genetic algorithm","GA","partial least squares method","PLS method","dimension reduction","input variables"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Oxygen Content","Soft Measurement","Back-propagation Neural Network","Genetic Algorithm","Partial Least Squares"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7978732","abstract":"The oxygen content in flue gas of power plant is one of the important variables for keeping the boiler combustion process stable and secure. Real-time monitoring and control for the oxygen content in flue gas of power plant is difficult at present. To address this problem, we propose a soft measurement method based on back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and genetic algorithm (GA) to predict the oxygen content in flue gas of power plant. In the algorithm, partial least squares (PLS) method is used to reduce dimensions of input variables. The model based on the data collected from the historical data of power plant is constructed by BP. The GA algorithm is utilized to optimize the parameters of BP for improving the accuracy of the model. The proposed method has been proved effective through iterative experiments.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978732","startPage":"1379","endPage":"1382","publicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7978054","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7961861/7978054/07978732.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural networks model for predicting oxygen content in flue gas of power plant","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7978732/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural networks model for predicting oxygen content in flue gas of power plant","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7978732/","accessionNumber":"17041604","publicationDate":"May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural networks model for predicting oxygen content in flue gas of power plant","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"RP248SunB153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107953S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7961861","isNumber":"7978054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7961861","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7978054","articleId":"7978732","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7978735,"authors":[{"name":"Fangyuan Si","affiliation":["College of information science and engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Fangyuan","lastName":"Si","id":"37086104072"},{"name":"Jinkuan Wang","affiliation":["College of information science and engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Jinkuan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280537400"},{"name":"Qiang Zhao","affiliation":["College of information science and engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China","Engineering Optimization & Smart Antenna Institute, Northeastern University at Qinhuangdao, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37403119700"},{"name":"Yinghua Han","affiliation":["Engineering Optimization & Smart Antenna Institute, Northeastern University at Qinhuangdao, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Yinghua","lastName":"Han","id":"37293173100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4657-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-4656-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4658-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"7978735","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":396},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7978735","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cogeneration","Load modeling","Optimization","Batteries","Pollution","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air pollution control","cogeneration","Internet","particle swarm optimisation","photovoltaic power systems","power engineering computing","power generation economics","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective optimization strategy","combined heat-power systems","energy Internet","interconnected multienergy-grids","information Internet","resource saving","environment protection","optimization coordination model","combined heat-and-power system","CHP system","wind generation","photovoltaic cell","PV cell","energy storage","gas storage","tariff structures","third-order model","generator efficiency","neighborhood re-dispatch particle swarm optimization algorithm","NR-PSO algorithm","pollution gas reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy Internet","Combined heat and power (CHP)","Distributed generation (DG)","Complimentary generation","Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978735","pdfPath":"/iel7/7961861/7978054/07978735.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","startPage":"1391","endPage":"1397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7978054","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978735","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-objective optimization strategy for combined heat and power systems of the energy internet","abstract":"Energy Internet is a kind of novel interconnected multi-energy-grids, highly coupled with the information internet. Aiming at the problems of resource saving and environment protection, a multi-objective optimization strategy in primary energies of the Energy Internet considering economic and environmental aspects has been proposed. An optimization coordination model was presented for combined heat and power (CHP) system with complimentary generation of wind, photovoltaic cell (PV), gas and energy storage in different tariff structures. Typical load and the third order model of generator efficiency were selected in the proposed model to make the result more accurate. To avoid the premature convergence problem, the neighborhood re-dispatch particle swarm optimization (NR-PSO) algorithm was adopted, which re-dispatches in neighborhood of the iteration that could avoid falling into the local optimum. Finally, three operating modes are detailed and the result indicates it can reach an equilibrium point that can reduce the pollution gas without too much additional cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7978735/","accessionNumber":"17041238","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7978735/","publicationDate":"May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A multi-objective optimization strategy for combined heat and power systems of the energy internet","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-objective optimization strategy for combined heat and power systems of the energy internet","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"RP251SunB161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071584S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7961861","isNumber":"7978054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7961861","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7978054","articleId":"7978735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7978762,"authors":[{"name":"Ping Li","affiliation":["School of Astronautics and Aeronautics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Li","id":"37085758037"},{"name":"Kaiyu Qin","affiliation":["School of Astronautics and Aeronautics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Kaiyu","lastName":"Qin","id":"37086050513"},{"name":"Hongping Pu","affiliation":["School of Astronautics and Aeronautics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Hongping","lastName":"Pu","id":"37086141772"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4657-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-4656-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4658-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"7978762","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Time-varying systems","Indexes","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Protocols","Attenuation","Kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","closed loop systems","control system synthesis","delays","distributed control","linear systems","linearisation techniques","multi-robot systems","nonlinear control systems","reduced order systems","robot dynamics","robot kinematics","robust control","state feedback","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed robust time-varying formation flight control","multiple unmanned aerial vehicle systems","time-delays","external disturbances","nonlinear kinematics model","nonlinear dynamics model","linear time-invariant double-integrator model","feedback linearization method","robust time-varying formation control","multiple UAV systems","state feedback","distributed control protocol design","reduced-order decoupled closed-loop dynamics","necessary and sufficient conditions","disturbance attenuation index"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UAV","Formation control","Robust control","Time-delay"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates robust control problems of time-varying formation flight for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) systems with the external disturbances and time-delay.

Then robust time-varying formation control is defined for multiple UAVs systems. Based on state feedback of neighbors, a distributed control protocol is designed. In order to decrease the difficulty of the analysis, the closed-loop dynamics is reduced-order and decoupled.

Firstly, we import a compressed function to transform the tracking error into one that stays in a compact set. Secondly, we use the prescribed performance bounded (PPB) control method to prescribe the trajectory of the transformed error. As a result, for any given initial states, the tracking error will converge into a preset set at a conservatively well-defined speed within a pre-specified time, and then further reduce into a smaller and preassigned residual set. All internal signals in the closed-loop are ensured to be globally ultimately uniformly bounded. Both theoretical analysis and practical application to robot system verify the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7961861/7978054/07978806.pdf","startPage":"1787","endPage":"1792","publicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978806","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7978054","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7978806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Globally tracking control for a class of uncertain nonlinear MIMO systems with prescribed performance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Convergence","Uncertainty","Trajectory","Nonlinear systems","Stability analysis","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO systems","nonlinear control systems","tracking","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["globally tracking control","uncertain nonlinear MIMO systems","tracking error","prescribed performance bounded control method","PPB control method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Globally tracking control","uncertain nonlinear MIMO systems","prescribed performance","globally ultimately uniformly bounded"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7978806/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Globally tracking control for a class of uncertain nonlinear MIMO systems with prescribed performance","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7978806/","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17041886","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Globally tracking control for a class of uncertain nonlinear MIMO systems with prescribed performance","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"RP322MonA013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083391S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7961861","isNumber":"7978054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7961861","xplore-issue":"7978054","articleId":"7978806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7978813,"authors":[{"name":"Li Min","affiliation":["Beijing Key Lab of Urban Intelligent Traffic Control Technology, North China University of Technology, Beijing"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Min","id":"37085848067"},{"name":"Zhang Hai-bo","affiliation":["Beijing Key Lab of Urban Intelligent Traffic Control Technology, North China University of Technology, Beijing"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Hai-bo","id":"38277935600"},{"name":"Wang Li","affiliation":["Beijing Key Lab of Urban Intelligent Traffic Control Technology, North China University of Technology, Beijing"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Li","id":"37537029500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4657-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-4656-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4658-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"7978813","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Traffic control","Delays","Roads","Genetic algorithms","Mathematical model","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","road traffic","vehicle routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interregional traffic coordination","multiobjective optimization","traffic control","route guidance","area traffic coordination","travel time","local area network","intersection delay","regional internal control","coordination effect","weighted strength parameters","transportation decision-maker","cooperative system","genetic algorithm","traffic simulation software","Paramics","real-world road network","Wangjing district","Beijing","traffic congestion","traffic operation efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Urban traffic","multi-objective optimization","genetic algorithm","regional boundary","control and guidance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7978813","abstract":"Traffic control and route guidance is a common method for realizing area traffic coordination.

In this paper, we study security monitoring WRSNs for disaster area built from the industrial wireless identification and sensing platform (WISP). By taking advantage of the strong coverage of equilateral triangle, a novel charging path named TRIANGLE is proposed as a static path planning method for a single MC. Comparing with S-CURVES(ad) which has been proved to be a superior charging path, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed charging path TRIANGLE has a better performance in terms of the number of alive nodes, the charging efficiency and the utilization rate of energy.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978856","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7961861/7978054/07978856.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7978054","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978856","publicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","startPage":"2063","endPage":"2067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel path planning of mobile charger in wireless rechargeable sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7978856","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"A novel path planning of mobile charger in wireless rechargeable sensor networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7978856/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7978856/","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17041351","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel path planning of mobile charger in wireless rechargeable sensor networks","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"RP372MonA093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083672S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7961861","isNumber":"7978054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7961861","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7978054","articleId":"7978856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7978857,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Li","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Inner Mongolian University, Hohhot, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Li","id":"37086097462"},{"name":"Rongkai Wu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Inner Mongolian University, Hohhot, China"],"firstName":"Rongkai","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086115353"},{"name":"Jiaxiang Zhao","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Inner Mongolian University, Hohhot, China"],"firstName":"Jiaxiang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086109515"},{"name":"Yingdong Ma","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Inner Mongolian University, Hohhot, China"],"firstName":"Yingdong","lastName":"Ma","id":"37086116503"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4657-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-4656-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4658-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"7978857","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":560},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Training","Feature extraction","Testing","Convolution","Neural networks","Activity recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","feedforward neural nets","image classification","object recognition","ubiquitous computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural networks","CNN","indoor human activity recognition","Ubisense system","spatial location information","spatial location data preprocessing","motion feature","frequency feature","statistic feature","local feature analysis","characteristic output items","Softmax classifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Human activity recognition","Convolutional neural networks","UWB-RFID"]}],"abstract":"In order to improve the accuracy of Indoor Human Activity Recognition based on the spatial location information, we proposed a recognition method using the convolutional neural network(CNN).

Due to the highly nonlinear dynamic nature, it is difficult to characterize the behavior of this actuator. The existing parametric modeling methods require to identify so many parameters that are difficult to implement. So the paper puts forward an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to approximate the dynamic behaviors of magneto-rheological damper with the characteristics of nonlinearity and hysteresis. We built a vibration test system to obtain the experimental data of the MR damper, such as the displacement and the velocity, the input current and the MR damping force. One and a half cycle of the experimental data are used to train the forward model. And the rest of data are used for testing. It has been known that noise disturbance in measured inputs and output exists in real system. Therefore, it is important to study the robustness of ANFIS network model. The results of the network show that the proposed ANFIS network is more optimal than BP network.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7978054","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978868","publicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7961861/7978054/07978868.pdf","startPage":"2133","endPage":"2138","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of magnetorheological damper using ANFIS","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of magnetorheological damper using ANFIS","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7978868/","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17041230","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7978868/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of magnetorheological damper using ANFIS","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"RP384MonA113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058593S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7961861","isNumber":"7978054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7961861","xplore-issue":"7978054","articleId":"7978868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7978869,"authors":[{"name":"Yize Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Software Engineering, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yize","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086067561"},{"name":"Yixiang Chen","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Software Engineering, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yixiang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37539706000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4657-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-4656-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4658-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"7978869","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":387},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognition of facial expression based on CNN-CBP features","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7961861/7978054/07978869.pdf","startPage":"2139","endPage":"2145","publicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7978054","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2017.7978869","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Face recognition","Support vector machines","Neural networks","Convolutional codes","Kernel","Bellows"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","feedforward neural nets","image classification","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CNN-CBP features","automatic facial expression recognition","facial image","feature extraction","hand-crafted features","geometric features","appearance features","auto-learned features","centralized binary patterns features","convolutional neural network features","feature classification","support vector machine","SVM","Extended Cohn-Kanade datasets","Japanese Femal Facial Expression datasets","recognition accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Facial Expression Recognition","Convolutional Neural Network","Centralized Binary Patterns","Combination of Features","Support Vector Machine"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7978869","abstract":"Automatical recognition of facial expression is an interesting and challenging problem, which has so many applications such as expression synthesis, human-robot interaction, metal state identification, intelligent tutoring systems, operator fatigue, music for mood, and clinical medicine.

The existed methods of features extraction are the hand-crafted features based on geometric features or appearance features, and the auto-learned features. To utilize the benefit of low computation of hand-crafted features and the high-representation of auto-learned features, we firstly proposed the combined features CNN-CBP with putting together Centralized Binary Patterns (CBP) features and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) features. And then, we classified the features using Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Different types of UAV are suitable for different inspection tasks and have different requirements for path planning. Based on the contents of the transmission line inspection, it can be divided into tower monitoring and line corridor monitoring. First, according to the characteristics of the tower monitoring, the multi-rotor UAV is used for the tower inspection. By considering the safe distance bewteen UAV and the tower and the features of the camera, the genetic algorithm (GA) is used to design a rational inspection path. Then, according to the requirements of the line corridor monitoring mission, the fixed-wing UAV is used for long distance inspection and the path planning mathematical model and objective function are established. Polar coordinate coding is used to overcome the restrictions of the maximum path deflection angle, the minimum step length and the number of the maximum path nodes. The GA and genetic simulated annealing (GSA) algorithms are used to obtain effective inspection paths.

time-varying spring stiffness and bearing friction. Although the FEHLS has no extra torque, the friction of the bearings will cause uncertain friction torque. Besides, due to the special mechanical structure of the FEHLS, the spring stiffness will vary near the zero position of the hydraulic cylinder and also cause uncertain torque. To compensate for the uncertain torque and improve the torque tracking accuracy of the FEHLS, an adaptive backstepping controller based on Chebyshev neural network (CNN) is proposed. First, the nonlinear control model of the FEHLS is established where the uncertain torque is lumped into unknown disturbance. Then, the CNN is used to approximate the lumped unknown distrubance. Based on the CNN approximation, an adaptive backstepping controller is designed. Finally, simulation studies are carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2017.7979036","startPage":"3075","endPage":"3080","publicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2017.7979036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7978054","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7961861/7978054/07979036.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear adaptive backstepping control of a friction based electro-hydraulic load simulator using chebyshev neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979036/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear adaptive backstepping control of a friction based electro-hydraulic load simulator using chebyshev neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7979036/","accessionNumber":"17041337","publicationDate":"May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear adaptive backstepping control of a friction based electro-hydraulic load simulator using chebyshev neural networks","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"RP552MonB124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093881S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7961861","isNumber":"7978054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7961861","xplore-issue":"7978054","articleId":"7979036","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7979039,"authors":[{"name":"Xiongjun Wu","affiliation":["National Defense Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Electromagnetic Scattering, The 802 Institute of Shanghai Academy of Space Flight Technology, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiongjun","lastName":"Wu","id":"37859715800"},{"name":"Yan Zhang","affiliation":["National Defense Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Electromagnetic Scattering, The 802 Institute of Shanghai Academy of Space Flight Technology, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086005078"},{"name":"Liang Ma","affiliation":["National Defense Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Electromagnetic Scattering, The 802 Institute of Shanghai Academy of Space Flight Technology, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Ma","id":"37086008346"},{"name":"Xinfan Xia","affiliation":["National Defense Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Electromagnetic Scattering, The 802 Institute of Shanghai Academy of Space Flight Technology, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xinfan","lastName":"Xia","id":"37086063247"},{"name":"Tao Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of North Texas, Denton, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085640940"},{"name":"Xue Zhang","affiliation":["National Defense Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Electromagnetic Scattering, The 802 Institute of Shanghai Academy of Space Flight Technology, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xue","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085998366"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4657-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-4656-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4658-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"7979039","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doppler radar","Dictionaries","Radar measurements","Radar detection","Compressed sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive waveform design","through-the-wall radar","compressed sensing based randomized step frequency","microwave techniques","interference","ground multipath reflection","randomized step frequency radar","compressed sensing theory","dictionary matrix","time-varying dictionary matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Waveform Design","Through-the-Wall Radar","Compressed Sensing","Randomized Step Frequency"]}],"abstract":"The through-the-wall radar systems with microwave techniques enable us to detect some specific targets through typical kinds of obstacles such as bricks, concrete, and trees. In the through-the-wall radar application, the performance is prone to degrade due to the interference of the ground multipath reflection. The traditional way to recover the range and velocity joint estimating of the targets requires large amount of sampling numbers, which is not available in many cases. In this paper, a novel randomized step frequency radar that combines the adaptive waveform design and the off-grid point effect simultaneously is proposed. The range and velocity joint estimating are recovered by exploiting sparseness of the targets and by invoking the compressed sensing (CS) theory, which reduces the sampling burden efficiently. In this new mechanism, each of the dictionary matrix element is first extended by adopting a Taylor expansion to an arbitrary precise off-grid point, instead of only the points in a discrete form. Then by adding the new generated information into the dictionary matrix adaptively, an updated time-varying new dictionary matrix is yielded. The proposed waveform design approach has the potential to achieve much higher estimation accuracy, a faster convergence speed and stronger robustness against unpredictable perturbations.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2017.7979039","publicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7961861/7978054/07979039.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2017.7979039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7978054","startPage":"3092","endPage":"3097","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive waveform design for through-the-wall radar using compressed sensing based randomized step frequency","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979039","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive waveform design for through-the-wall radar using compressed sensing based randomized step frequency","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979039/","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17041147","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7979039/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive waveform design for through-the-wall radar using compressed sensing based randomized step frequency","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"RP555MonB131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092245S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7961861","isNumber":"7978054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7961861","xplore-issue":"7978054","articleId":"7979039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7979049,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Dingbang","affiliation":["Ministry of Education of China, Key Laboratory of System Control and Information Processing, Shanghai","School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Dingbang","id":"37086010078"},{"name":"Chen Hao","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Aerospace Intelligent Control Technology, Shanghai"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Hao","id":"37086010618"},{"name":"Sang Xiaochong","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Aerospace Intelligent Control Technology, Shanghai"],"firstName":"Sang","lastName":"Xiaochong","id":"37086014299"},{"name":"Li Jianxun","affiliation":["Ministry of Education of China, Key Laboratory of System Control and Information Processing, Shanghai","School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Jianxun","id":"37542918400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4657-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-4656-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4658-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"7979049","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979049","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image restoration","Wiener filters","Degradation","Gaussian distribution","Mathematical model","Frequency-domain analysis","Parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","Gaussian distribution","image motion analysis","image restoration","parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion blurred star image centroid optimized extraction","star energy","prior Gaussian distribution information","star centroids calculation","approximate linear motion model","motion blur parameters estimation","general images","PSF","Wiener filter method","high dynamic conditions","star navigation system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Motion blur","Star image restoration","Centroid extraction","Gaussian distribution","Optimize"]}],"abstract":"Star centroid extraction is the precondition of star recognition in star navigation system. Star image will be motion blurred under high dynamic conditions. Conventional methods such as Wiener filter method, restore the blurred star image with an estimated PSF to calculate the star centroids. The unique characteristic of star images different from general images is ignored in conventional methods. In addition, the error of motion blur parameters estimation and the approximate linear motion model can decrease the accuracy of star centroids calculation. This paper proposes a method utilizing the prior Gaussian distribution information of star energy to deal with the motion blurred star images. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method gets smaller error in star centroids calculation compared with the conventional estimation method.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2017.7979049","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7978054","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2017.7979049","publicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7961861/7978054/07979049.pdf","startPage":"3149","endPage":"3154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion blurred star image centroid optimized extraction based on prior Gaussian distribution","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Motion blurred star image centroid optimized extraction based on prior Gaussian distribution","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7979049/","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17041260","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979049/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion blurred star image centroid optimized extraction based on prior Gaussian distribution","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"RP565MonB145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110982S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7961861","isNumber":"7978054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7961861","xplore-issue":"7978054","articleId":"7979049","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7979096,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Yaoqun","affiliation":["Institute of System Engineering, Harbin University of Commerce, Harbin"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Yaoqun","id":"37443190700"},{"name":"Yu Qijia","affiliation":["Institute of System Engineering, Harbin University of Commerce, Harbin"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Qijia","id":"37086055336"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4657-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-4656-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4658-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"7979096","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logistics","Neural networks","Optimization","Neurons","Mathematical model","Automobiles","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logistics","minimax techniques","vehicle routing","wavelet neural nets","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mathematical logistic distribution model","route optimization","local minima","Shannon wavelet chaotic neural network","activation function","sigmoid wavelet","reversed bifurcation","maximal Lyapunov exponents","neural unit","function optimization","logistic distribution routing","vehicle routing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Logistic distribution","Vehicle routing problem","Chaotic neural network","Traveling salesman problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979096","abstract":"A mathematical logistic distribution model with constraints was constructed and a wavelet chaotic neural network model was proposed to solve the route optimization problem of logistic distribution.

However, most cloud service providers have their own interface type, energy consumption level and other service features. A service broker in cloud computing plays an intermediate role between providers and users. It is designed to find out the suitable services from the various service providers and meet the user's requests. Maximizing the energy efficiency is not only good for the environment protection but also could benefit the providers.

Simulation results show that our proposed strategy could effectively reduce the energy consumption and maintain user's satisfaction in a reasonable level at the same time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979222/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17041543","htmlLink":"/document/7979222/","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An energy sentient service brokering strategy in cloud computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An energy sentient service brokering strategy in cloud computing","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"RP738MonC175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047579S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7961861","isNumber":"7978054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7961861","xplore-issue":"7978054","articleId":"7979222","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7979232,"authors":[{"name":"Dongyang Dou","affiliation":["School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou"],"firstName":"Dongyang","lastName":"Dou","id":"37702545300"},{"name":"Bin Xue","affiliation":["School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Xue","id":"37086088006"},{"name":"Min He","affiliation":["Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Large Engineering Equipment Detection and Control, Xuzhou Institute of Technology, Xuzhou"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"He","id":"37086090387"},{"name":"Jian Jiang","affiliation":["School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37086086415"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4657-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-4656-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4658-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"7979232","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979232","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Feature extraction","Genetic algorithms","Vibrations","Fault diagnosis","Rolling bearings","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric machines","fault diagnosis","genetic algorithms","pattern classification","rolling bearings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent fault diagnosis method","rotating machinery","genetic algorithm","frequency domain","vibration signals","empirical mode decomposition","rule-based classifier ensemble","rolling bearings","decision table","diversity evaluation","optimal ensemble","base classifiers","weighted voting strategy","fault recognition","inner race fault","outer race fault","rolling element fault","SKF 6203 bearings"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Classifier ensemble","Rolling bearing","Genetic algorithm","Rule"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2017.7979232","pdfPath":"/iel7/7961861/7978054/07979232.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","startPage":"4178","endPage":"4181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7978054","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2017.7979232","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An intelligent fault diagnosis method for rotating machinery based on genetic algorithm and classifier ensemble","abstract":"On the basis of extracting six time-domain features and five frequency-domain ones from vibration signals processed by empirical mode decomposition, an intelligent method to construct a rule-based classifier ensemble for fault diagnosis of rolling bearings was presented. The candidate reducts which could be used to build the base classifiers were found by applying a genetic algorithm for feature reduction on the decision table, and then the other genetic algorithm for diversity evaluation was used to search an optimal ensemble of base classifiers.

At the same time, the original local sensitivity analysis algorithm is improved as the global sensitivity analysis algorithm and it increases the accuracy and stability of the Garson algorithm. Through the typical benchmark test function simulation, the experimental results show that the improved Garson algorithm has higher accuracy and stability in the evaluation of sensitivity coefficient. Finally, the improved Garson algorithm is applied to evaluate the input factors of the plate-fin heat exchangers.

network adaptive control for a uncertain nonlinear systems with prescribed performance","abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of adaptive neural networks (NNs) prescribed performance control for a class of unknown nonlinear systems. A neural network is used as feedforward compensator to approximate the unknown function that help us determine the NN approximation domain a priori via the bound of the reference signal. A novel adaptive prescribed performance control (PPC) scheme is proposed. The predetermined approximation domain can be used to choose centers and widths of the radial basis function neural networks. The advantage of the proposed control scheme is that the prescribed performance of the closed-loop systems can be obtained not only on a compact set, but also on the outside of the approximation domain, without violation the predefined bounds. The simulation is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979288/","accessionNumber":"17042121","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7979288/","publicationDate":"May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A novel neural network adaptive control for a uncertain nonlinear systems with prescribed performance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel neural network adaptive control for a uncertain nonlinear systems with prescribed performance","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"RP804TueA016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084576S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7961861","isNumber":"7978054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7961861","xplore-issue":"7978054","articleId":"7979288","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7979297,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenping Ji","affiliation":["School of Automation and Electrical Engineering, Shenyang Ligong University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Zhenping","lastName":"Ji","id":"37655152200"},{"name":"Shuai Liu","affiliation":["School of Automation and Electrical Engineering, Shenyang Ligong University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Shuai","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085905764"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4657-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-4656-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4658-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"7979297","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cooling","Casting","Billets","Linear programming","Pareto optimization","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["casting","evolutionary computation","heat transfer","metallurgy","optimal control","Pareto optimisation","product quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous casting secondary cooling water","differential evolution algorithm","DE algorithm","multiobjective optimization algorithm","internal defects","optimal secondary cooling water flowrate","casting speeds","Pareto-optimal solutions","optimal control","solidification heat transfer mathematical model","metallurgical criteria","technological constraints","crowding distance","product quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Continuous casting","secondary cooling","optimization","differential evolution(DE) algorithm","crowding distance","Pareto optimal solutions"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979297","abstract":"The secondary cooling water has a considerable influence on cracks and other internal defects of the billets.

Performance indicators can be used as the selection strategies. The selection strategy of indicator based evolutionary multi-objective algorithms (EMOAs) is guided by a general preference information, which maps objectives into a single contribution value by means of a set of utility functions. R2-EMOA is one of the most important indicator-based algorithms to solve MOPs. We use fast R2-ranking to rank the individuals of EMOAs. This paper suggests a new weight generator strategy, which is based on direction angles, for MOPs. Our main purpose is to explore the relationship among direction angles, weight vectors and direction vectors. Our proposed weight generator scheme is incorporated to two different search engines, resulting in two new EMOAs, named IR2-MOGA and IR2-MODE. The performance of our proposed method is validated and compared with other R2-EMOAs on a number of unconstraint benchmark problems. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithms can significantly improve the convergence and diversity of R2-EMOA.","publicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7961861/7978054/07979300.pdf","startPage":"4548","endPage":"4553","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2017.7979300","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2017.7979300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7978054","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new weight vectors generation method for R2 indicator based evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new weight vectors generation method for R2 indicator based evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979300/","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7979300/","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17041680","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new weight vectors generation method for R2 indicator based evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"RP816TueA036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080923S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7961861","isNumber":"7978054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7961861","xplore-issue":"7978054","articleId":"7979300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7979332,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Jia","affiliation":["Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Jia","id":"37085996746"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4657-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-4656-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4658-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"7979332","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1888},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine learning","Training","Computer vision","Neural networks","Computer architecture","Stochastic processes","Machine learning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","image recognition","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image recognition method","deep learning algorithms","machine learning algorithms","distributed representations","artificial intelligence problems","computer vision","training deep neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["deep learning","computer vision","developments","applications","trends","challenges"]}],"abstract":"Deep learning algorithms are a subset of the machine learning algorithms, which aim at discovering multiple levels of distributed representations.

In order to solve the problem of stiff description, we intend to extract richer features using convolutional neural network (CNN). A neural and probabilistic framework has been proposed consequently which combines CNN with a special form of recurrent neural network (RNN) to produce an end-to-end image captioning. We use a model that takes advantage of word to vector to encode the variable length input into a fixed dimensional vector. Considering the description of the object in an image is not specific enough, we introduce an attention mechanism through visualization to show how the model is able to fix its gaze on salient objects. We validate our model on three benchmark datasets and get great performance by using standard evaluation metrics.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2017.7979342","startPage":"4789","endPage":"4794","publicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2017.7979342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7978054","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7961861/7978054/07979342.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual attention based on long-short term memory model for image caption generation","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979342/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Visual attention based on long-short term memory model for image caption generation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7979342/","accessionNumber":"17041527","publicationDate":"May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual attention based on long-short term memory model for image caption generation","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"RP858TueA111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069005S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7961861","isNumber":"7978054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7961861","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7978054","articleId":"7979342","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7979345,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University of Technology, Zhuzhou, China","Key Laboratory for Electric Drive Control and Intelligent Equipment of Hunan Province, Zhuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086107119"},{"name":"Gang Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University of Technology, Zhuzhou, China","Key Laboratory for Electric Drive Control and Intelligent Equipment of Hunan Province, Zhuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085538047"},{"name":"Shen-Ping Xiao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University of Technology, Zhuzhou, China","Key Laboratory for Electric Drive Control and Intelligent Equipment of Hunan Province, Zhuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shen-Ping","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37577363400"},{"name":"Chang-Sheng Luo","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University of Technology, Zhuzhou, China","Key Laboratory for Electric Drive Control and Intelligent Equipment of Hunan Province, Zhuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chang-Sheng","lastName":"Luo","id":"37086105488"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4657-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-4656-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4658-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"7979345","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","discrete systems","Lyapunov methods","matrix algebra","neural nets","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["passivity analysis","neural networks","time-varying discrete delays","distributed delays","Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional","ALKF","inequality formula","generalized free-weighting-matrix","GFWM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural networks(NNs)","Time-varying discrete and distributed delays","Augment Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional(ALKF)","Generalized free-weighting-matrix(GFWM) approach"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979345","abstract":"This paper focus on the problem of passivity of neural networks in the presence of time-varying discrete and distributed delays.

Mass-spring-damper (MSD) system is frequently encountered in many compliant robotics systems as a basic architecture. The actuator(s) of robots can be designed based on the form of MSD in order to achieve desired compliant properties. The conventional MSD model is with constant/static coefficients and has appeared in most compliant robots. However, in numerous application scenarios, the coefficients associated with MSD are time variant, making the traditional control strategies (e.g., PID control) hard to deal with. This paper propose a novel control approach for tracking control of MSD model with time-varying coefficients.

In order to decrease the number of search locations, the amount of computations, and enhance the prediction accuracy, an improved block matching motion estimation algorithm based on adaptive rood pattern search (ARPS) is proposed. Firstly, we use spatial correlation characteristic to predict motion vector (MV) of the current macro-block in the algorithm. Secondly, we consider to eliminate the influence of neighborhood macro-blocks having low relevance to the current macro-block in the prediction process. Finally, we utilize the weighted average MV of two macro-blocks with the smaller matching error in the neighborhood macro-blocks to calculate the predictive MV of current macro-block, instead of using the fixed single macro-block forecast pattern in ARPS. Experimental results show that our algorithm provides the better performance in terms of the computational complexity and the prediction precision in comparison with APRS and other block matching algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7961861/7978054/07979419.pdf","startPage":"5199","endPage":"5203","publicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2017.7979419","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2017.7979419","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7978054","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979419","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved block matching motion estimation algorithm based on adaptive rood pattern search","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prediction algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Motion estimation","Correlation","Distortion measurement","Pattern matching","Diamond"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion estimation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved block matching motion estimation algorithm","adaptive rood pattern search","ARPS","computational complexity","spatial correlation characteristic","fixed single macro-block forecast pattern"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fast Block Matching","Adaptive Rood Pattern Search","Super Resolution Reconstruction","Spatial Correlation","Prediction Motion Vector"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979419/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"An improved block matching motion estimation algorithm based on adaptive rood pattern search","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7979419/","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17040860","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved block matching motion estimation algorithm based on adaptive rood pattern search","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"RP935TueAIS39.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061582S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7961861","isNumber":"7978054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7961861","xplore-issue":"7978054","articleId":"7979419","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7979423,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Guan","affiliation":["School of Automation, Shenyang Institute of Aeronautical Engineering, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Guan","id":"37574132200"},{"name":"Wentao Li","affiliation":["School of Automation, Shenyang Institute of Aeronautical Engineering, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Wentao","lastName":"Li","id":"37086148509"},{"name":"Jianhui Xi","affiliation":["School of Automation, Shenyang Institute of Aeronautical Engineering, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Jianhui","lastName":"Xi","id":"37273716700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4657-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-4656-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4658-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"7979423","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979423","abstract":"Camera calibration has been a very important problem for 3D objects measurement technique, because it will have a impact on the measurement accuracy. Plane-based camera calibration is usually used in camera calibration. In order to solve the nonlinear optimization problem during the process of plane-based camera calibration, a new method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of linear camera model are obtained by direct linear transformation (DLT). Then, the intrinsic parameters are used as the initial values of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to calculate the optimal values of intrinsic, in addition, the camera nonlinear model is used to obtain the extrinsic parameters. Finally the accurate parameters values are given. An example is given to show that the method can improve the calibration precision obviously compared with existing method.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2017.7979423","startPage":"5217","endPage":"5221","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference

A key tool for analyzing these signals is the so-called graph Fourier transform (GFT). Alternative definitions of GFT have been suggested in the literature, based on the eigen-decomposition of either the graph Laplacian or adjacency matrix. In this paper, we address the general case of directed graphs and we propose an alternative approach that builds the graph Fourier basis as the set of orthonormal vectors that minimize a continuous extension of the graph cut size, known as the Lov\u00e1sz extension. To cope with the nonconvexity of the problem, we propose two alternative iterative optimization methods, properly devised for handling orthogonality constraints. Finally, we extend the method to minimize a continuous relaxation of the balanced cut size. The formulated problem is again nonconvex, and we propose an efficient solution method based on an explicit-implicit gradient algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2017.2726979","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/8010479/07979496.pdf","startPage":"796","endPage":"811","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2017.2726979","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8010479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Graph Fourier Transform for Directed Graphs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979496","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979496/","displayDocTitle":"On the Graph Fourier Transform for Directed Graphs","volume":"11","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17135752","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7979496/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"TROPIC Project","grantNumber":"Nr.

By exploiting the slow timevarying parameters, such as channel correlation and angles of departure (AoDs) of UEs, we first propose a location-assisted two-layer precoding scheme for downlink transmission. The first-layer precoding aims to decompose the original massive MIMO system into several low-dimension MIMO systems, with each operating on the orthogonal subspace. Through proper UE clustering, we show that the first-layer precoding matrix can be approximated using a constant-envelope matrix, which results in significant reduction on hardware complexity of AP. The second-layer precoding is designed to eliminate the multi-UE interference within each low-dimension MIMO system. Since the AoD information is usually not perfectly known at AP, we then investigate the effect of AoD uncertainty on the performance of the proposed precoding scheme. In particular, we propose a new analytic method to fast estimate approximately the power loss due to AoD error. Numerical simulations are presented to evaluate the performance of location-assisted precoding under different system parameters, including Rician factor, altitude of AP, and AoD uncertainty. The results show that the location-assisted precoding outperforms match filter precoding and basis expansion-based precoding in the air-to-ground transmission scenarios significantly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979497/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","volume":"5","accessionNumber":"17124309","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2017","publicationDate":"2017","htmlLink":"/document/7979497/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Three-Dimension Massive MIMO for Air-to-Ground Transmission: Location-Assisted Precoding and Impact of AoD Uncertainty","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Major Research Plan of National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"91438115"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671472 and 61371123"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Jiangsu Province Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"BK20160079"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Three-Dimension Massive MIMO for Air-to-Ground Transmission: Location-Assisted Precoding and Impact of AoD Uncertainty","sourcePdf":"access-xia-2726528-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115767S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7979497","onlineDate":"13 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7979500,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Romero","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Digital Technology Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA","Department of Information and Communication Technology, University of Agder, Grimstad, Norway"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/8010479/7979500/romer-2726976-small.gif","p":["Daniel Romero (M\u201916) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in\n signal theory and communications from the University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain, in 2011 and 2015, respectively.

A challenging problem encountered in this context pertains to determining the attributes of a set of vertices given those of another subset at possibly different time instants. Leveraging spatiotemporal dynamics can drastically reduce the number of observed vertices, and hence the sampling cost. Alleviating the limited flexibility of the existing approaches, the present paper broadens the kernel-based graph function estimation framework to reconstruct time-evolving functions over possibly time-evolving topologies. This approach inherits the versatility and generality of kernel-based methods, for which no knowledge on distributions or second-order statistics is required. Systematic guidelines are provided to construct two families of space-time kernels with complementary strengths: the first facilitates judicious control of regularization on a space-time frequency plane, whereas the second accommodates time-varying topologies. Batch and online estimators are also put forth. The latter comprise a novel kernel Kalman filter, developed to reconstruct space-time functions at affordable computational cost. Numerical tests with real datasets corroborate the merits of the proposed methods relative to competing alternatives.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2017.2726976","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/8010479/07979500.pdf","startPage":"856","endPage":"869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8010479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2017.2726976","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kernel-Based Reconstruction of Space-Time Functions on Dynamic Graphs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979500","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/4200690/8010479/7979500-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Kernel-Based Reconstruction of Space-Time Functions on Dynamic Graphs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979500/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17135742","htmlLink":"/document/7979500/","volume":"11","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"Army Research Office","grantNumber":"W911NF-15-1-0492"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1343248, 1442686 and 1514056"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Kernel-Based Reconstruction of Space-Time Functions on Dynamic Graphs","sourcePdf":"jstsp-giannakis-2726976-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.17061S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"8010479","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"8010479","articleId":"7979500","onlineDate":"13 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7979501,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8059894/7979501/pyang-2726820-small.gif","p":["Peng Yang (S\u201915) received the B.E. degree from the Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree at the School of Electronic Information and Communications.","Since 2015, he is also a Visiting Ph.D. Student with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada.

To achieve better performance, spatial crowdsourcing task relies on both worker's effort and skill. Therefore, to maximize the long-term platform utility, we exploit fog platform as a service to identify valuable workers through learning their performance information. Worker's historical performance data are recorded at local fog server, based on which valuable workers are identified and selected to perform the tasks. During worker selection, we aim at balancing the exploration and exploitation, and propose an online algorithm that promotes workers who are not fully explored. With budget constraint, the proposed algorithm is able to maximize the long-term platform utility. Theoretical analysis indicates that the proposed learning algorithm achieves asymptotically diminishing regret.

The proposed readout scheme operates in two modes, fine step SAR (FS-SAR) mode and coarsestep single-slope (CS-SS) mode, depending on the difference (A) between a chosen pixel and the previous pixel. If a chosen pixel is at a boundary of an object with a large A from the previous pixel, the readout ADC works in the CS-SS mode to readout the edge strength (ES), while the FS-SAR mode is applied for other pixels. By displaying the ES, a multi-level edge image can be obtained in a real time along with a normal image with no hardware/time overhead. By saving the MSBs conversion cycles regardless of A, the proposed dual-mode readout scheme enhances the readout speed and reduces power consumption. A prototype QQVGA CIS with 10-bit SAR ADCs was fabricated in a 0.18-\u03bcm 1P4M CMOS image sensor process with a 4.9-\u03bcm pixel pitch. With a maximum pixel rate of 61.4 Mp/s, the prototype demonstrated figure of merits of 70 pJ/pixel/frame, 0.35 e\u0305 nJ, and 0.34 e\u0305 pJ/step.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2017.2718665","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/8015205/07979502.pdf","startPage":"2488","endPage":"2497","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2017.2718665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8015205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Dual-Imaging Speed-Enhanced CMOS Image Sensor for Real-Time Edge Image Extraction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979502","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979502/","displayDocTitle":"A Dual-Imaging Speed-Enhanced CMOS Image Sensor for Real-Time Edge Image Extraction","volume":"52","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17122341","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7979502/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003662","fundingName":"IT R&D program (SoC-SW platform for computer-vision based UI/UX on wearable smart devices) of MOTIE/KEIT","grantNumber":"10049270"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dual-Imaging Speed-Enhanced CMOS Image Sensor for Real-Time Edge Image Extraction","sourcePdf":"jssc-ryu-2718665-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079547S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"8015205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8015205","articleId":"7979502","onlineDate":"13 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7979507,"authors":[{"name":"David B.

Adaptive Kalman filtering is used to estimate wheel speed and acceleration for each wheel. Single core or multicore processor-based embedded systems perform the required estimation using a two-stage extended Kalman filter in many clock cycles, which limits Kalman filter speed and accuracy. In the proposed system, purely arithmetic operations used in the process are simplified and implemented as embedded logic to reduce the overhead delays and increase the update rate by 48%. The proposed system is run sequentially using finite-state machines, while a large number of multiplication and division operations are removed through rewiring and logic reuse. The simplifications not only reduce the amount of logic required to perform the operations by 39.7% but also use simple logic, which can run faster than the replaced logic on field-programmable gate array. The results presented show comparable root-mean-square wheel speed error with a high update rate of 20 MHz when running on a 50-MHz board in all scenarios. The system also provides accurate wheel acceleration estimation, which is crucial for many systems, including the reference system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-Based Implementation of Kalman Filter for Real-Time Estimation of Tire Velocity and Acceleration","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2017.2726529","startPage":"5749","endPage":"5758","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2017.2726529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8006334","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/8006334/07979508.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979508","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979508/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.1, 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-Based Implementation of Kalman Filter for Real-Time Estimation of Tire Velocity and Acceleration","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"17","htmlLink":"/document/7979508/","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2017","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Sept.1, 2017","accessionNumber":"17099046","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-Based Implementation of Kalman Filter for Real-Time Estimation of Tire Velocity and Acceleration","sourcePdf":"jsen-selamat-2726529-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114606S","chronDate":"Sept.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"8006334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8006334","articleId":"7979508","onlineDate":"13 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7979522,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wu","affiliation":["College of Communication and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7979522/wwu-2726581-small.gif","p":["Wei Wu received the B.S. degree in electronics and information engineering from the Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2012.

Particularly, we aim to minimize the total transmit power and maximize the sum secrecy rate (SSR) of the system simultaneously, under the assumption that the channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdroppers is not perfectly known at the transmitter. Considering the conflict between two objectives, a multi-objective optimization (MOO) framework based on the weighted Tchebycheff approach is proposed. The formulated MOO problem is non-convex and intractable. To tackle it, several auxiliary variables are introduced and the corresponding Taylor series expansion is employed to linearize the term related to each auxiliary variable. Then, the non-convexity resulting from the CSI errors is recast as a convex one with the aid of S-procedure and Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Based on above treatments, a robust iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the original problem. Simulation results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design, but also unveil the tradeoff between the total transmit power and the SSR.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979522/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","volume":"5","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"17124568","publicationDate":"2017","htmlLink":"/document/7979522/","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust Multi-Objective Beamforming Design for Power Efficient and Secure Communication in MU-MISO Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271232, 61372126 and 61501171"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008081","fundingName":"Open Research Fund of the National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University","grantNumber":"2012D05"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Robust Multi-Objective Beamforming Design for Power Efficient and Secure Communication in MU-MISO Networks","sourcePdf":"access-wu-2726581-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067607S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7979522","onlineDate":"13 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7979523,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Qiu","affiliation":["Aviation University Air Force, Changchun, China","Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/8010479/7979523/qiu-2726969-small.gif","p":["Kai Qiu received the B.E. degree in electronic engineering, in 2009,\n from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electronic\n engineering.

However, many real-world graph signals are time-varying, and they evolve smoothly, so instead of the signals themselves being bandlimited or smooth on graph, it is more reasonable that their temporal differences are smooth on graph. In this paper, a new batch reconstruction method of time-varying graph signals is proposed by exploiting the smoothness of the temporal difference signals, and the uniqueness of the solution to the corresponding optimization problem is theoretically analyzed. Furthermore, driven by practical applications faced with real-time requirements, huge size of data, lack of computing center, or communication difficulties between two nonneighboring vertices, an online distributed method is proposed by applying local properties of the temporal difference operator and the graph Laplacian matrix. Experiments on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed methods.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2017.2726969","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/8010479/07979523.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2017.2726969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8010479","startPage":"870","endPage":"883","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Varying Graph Signal Reconstruction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979523","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Time-Varying Graph Signal Reconstruction","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979523/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17135750","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7979523/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"NSFC 61571263, 61371137, 61531166005 and 51459003"},{"fundingName":"Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program","grantNumber":"2014Z01005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Varying Graph Signal Reconstruction","sourcePdf":"jstsp-gu-2726969-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104335S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"8010479","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8010479","articleId":"7979523","onlineDate":"13 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7979524,"authors":[{"name":"Hilmi E.

Specifically, graph learning problems are posed as the estimation of graph Laplacian matrices from some observed data under given structural constraints (e.g., graph connectivity and sparsity level). From a probabilistic perspective, the problems of interest correspond to maximum a posteriori parameter estimation of Gaussian-Markov random field models, whose precision (inverse covariance) is a graph Laplacian matrix. For the proposed graph learning problems, specialized algorithms are developed by incorporating the graph Laplacian and structural constraints. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform the current state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2017.2726975","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2017.2726975","startPage":"825","endPage":"841","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/8010479/07979524.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8010479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graph Learning From Data Under Laplacian and Structural Constraints","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/4200690/8010479/7979524-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979524/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Graph Learning From Data Under Laplacian and Structural Constraints","volume":"11","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2017","accessionNumber":"17135744","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7979524/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1410009 and CCF-1527874"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Graph Learning From Data Under Laplacian and Structural Constraints","sourcePdf":"jstsp-egilmez-2726975-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.249061S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"8010479","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"8010479","articleId":"7979524","onlineDate":"13 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7979525,"authors":[{"name":"Felipe Petroski Such","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/8010479/7979525/such-2726981-small.gif","p":["Felipe Petroski Such received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer\n engineering from the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), New York, NY, USA, in 2017.

Banks of finite-impulse response filters are learned on a hierarchy of layers, each contributing more abstract information than the previous layer. The simplicity and elegance of the convolutional filtering process makes them perfect for structured problems, such as image, video, or voice, where vertices are homogeneous in the sense of number, location, and strength of neighbors. The vast majority of classification problems, for example in the pharmaceutical, homeland security, and financial domains are unstructured. As these problems are formulated into unstructured graphs, the heterogeneity of these problems, such as number of vertices, number of connections per vertex, and edge strength, cannot be tackled with standard convolutional techniques. We propose a novel neural learning framework that is capable of handling both homogeneous and heterogeneous data while retaining the benefits of traditional CNN successes. Recently, researchers have proposed variations of CNNs that can handle graph data. In an effort to create learnable filter banks of graphs, these methods either induce constraints on the data or require preprocessing. As opposed to spectral methods, our framework, which we term Graph-CNNs, defines filters as polynomials of functions of the graph adjacency matrix. Graph-CNNs can handle both heterogeneous and homogeneous graph data, including graphs having entirely different vertex or edge sets. We perform experiments to validate the applicability of Graph-CNNs to a variety of structured and unstructured classification problems and demonstrate state-of-the-art results on document and molecule classification problems.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2017.2726981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8010479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2017.2726981","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/8010479/07979525.pdf","startPage":"884","endPage":"896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Spatial Filtering With Graph Convolutional Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Robust Spatial Filtering With Graph Convolutional Neural Networks","volume":"11","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7979525/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17135745","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979525/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National GEM Consortium through the GEM Fellowship"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Spatial Filtering With Graph Convolutional Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"jstsp-dominguez-2726981-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147029S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"8010479","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8010479","articleId":"7979525","onlineDate":"13 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7979526,"authors":[{"name":"Lina Yuan","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7979526/yuan-2726559-small.gif","p":["Lina Yuan received the B.Eng. degree in electronic engineering from Guizhou Minzu University in 2009 and the M.Sc. degree in communications engineering from the Guilin University of Electronic Technology in 2012.

To enhance the throughput performance of some faraway WDs, we allow one of the WDs to act as the cluster head (CH) that helps forward the messages of the other cluster members. However, the performance of the proposed cluster-based cooperation is fundamentally limited by the high energy consumption of the CH, who needs to transmit all the WDs' messages including its own. To tackle this issue, we exploit the capability of multi-antenna energy beamforming (EB) at the HAP, which can focus more transferred power to the CH to balance its energy consumption in assisting the other WDs. Specifically, we first derive the throughput performance of each individual WD under the proposed scheme. Then, we jointly optimize the EB design, the transmit time allocation among the HAP and the WDs, and the transmit power allocation of the CH to maximize the minimum data rate achievable among all the WDs (the max-min throughput) for improved throughput fairness among the WDs. An efficient optimal algorithm is proposed to solve the joint optimization problem. Moreover, we simulate under practical network setups and show that the proposed multi-antenna enabled cluster-based cooperation can effectively improve the throughput fairness of WPCN.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Wireless sensor networks","Wireless communication","Resource management","Information processing","Antennas","Energy

Previous effort has been devoted to geo-locating users in a city using supervised learning approaches, which depend on the availability of high quality training datasets. However, it is difficult to obtain such training datasets in the real-world CPS applications due to the issue of privacy. In this work, we develop an unsupervised approach, called a Physical-Social-Aware Inference (PSAI) scheme, to jointly infer a user's localness and a venue's local attractiveness by exploring both the physical and social information embedded in the location-based social networks (LBSN). We further implement a parallel PSAI framework on the platform of a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) to enhance its ability to process large-scale data. Our extensive experiments on the real-world LBSN datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the PSAI scheme compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.","doi":"10.1109/TBDATA.2017.2726551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBDATA.2017.2726551","startPage":"679","endPage":"690","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Big Data","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Big Data","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687317/9258584/07979537.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9258584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Physical-Social-Aware Localness Inference by Exploring Big Data from Location-Based Services","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979537/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 1 2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"On Physical-Social-Aware Localness Inference by Exploring Big Data from Location-Based Services","volume":"6","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2020","accessionNumber":"20167190","publicationDate":"1 Dec. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/7979537/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CBET-1637251, CNS-1566465 and IIS-1447795"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"Army Research Office","grantNumber":"W911NF-16-1-0388"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Physical-Social-Aware Localness Inference by Exploring Big Data from Location-Based Services","sourcePdf":"tbdata-wang-2726551-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.226009S","chronDate":"Dec. 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"6687317","isNumber":"9258584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687317","xplore-issue":"9258584","articleId":"7979537","onlineDate":"13 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7979540,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Luo","affiliation":["School of Electronics Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","Imperial College London, London, U.K"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/8053877/7979540/luo-2726993-small.gif","p":["Kai Luo (M\u201914) received the B.Eng. degree from the School of\n Electronics Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2006, and\n the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, U.K.,\n under the supervision of Prof. A.

Moreover, the proposed transmit beamforming design controls the power distribution per individual target. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using computer simulation studies and compared with techniques which simply combine Tx beamforming design with multitarget localization methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Transmitter\u2013Receiver Optimization in Multitarget MIMO Radar","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2017.2726993","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8053877/07979540.pdf","startPage":"6292","endPage":"6302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2017.2726993","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8053877","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979540","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979540/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1, 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Joint Transmitter\u2013Receiver Optimization in Multitarget MIMO Radar","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"23","htmlLink":"/document/7979540/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"1 Dec.1, 2017","accessionNumber":"17240963","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501193"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Joint Transmitter\u2013Receiver Optimization in Multitarget MIMO Radar","sourcePdf":"tsp-manikas-2726993-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082859S","chronDate":"Dec.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8053877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8053877","articleId":"7979540","onlineDate":"13 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7979541,"authors":[{"name":"Constantinos Psomas","affiliation":["KIOS Research and Innovation Center of Excellence, University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Constantinos","lastName":"Psomas","orcid":"0000-0002-2696-7397","id":"37085372452"},{"name":"Ioannis Krikidis","affiliation":["KIOS Research and Innovation Center of Excellence, University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Krikidis","id":"37275149300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"7979541","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":930},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Backscatter","Decoding","Wireless sensor networks","Wireless communication","Interference","Signal resolution","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backscatter","decoding","directive antennas","interference suppression","next generation networks","probability","wireless channels","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision resolution techniques","ultra-narrow band transmissions","wireless powered sensor networks","wireless powered backscatter communications","next-generation low-powered sensor networks","Internet of Things","multiple simultaneous transmissions","dyadic backscatter channel","received signal attenuation","directional antennas","successive interference cancellation","analytical expressions","decoding probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Backscatter communications","sensor networks","ultra-narrow band","Poisson point process"]}],"abstract":"Wireless powered backscatter communications is an attractive technology for next-generation low-powered sensor networks such as the Internet of Things.

The model predicts the joint exceedance probability of rain attenuation based on a new family of Archimedean copulas, called the hyperbolic cosecant copula. Furthermore, employing the hierarchical Archimedean copula structures, the proposed methodology can be used for the prediction of joint first-order statistics of rain attenuation for dual- and multiple-site diversity satellite communication systems. The proposed method has been tested on an extensive data set of site diversity experiments with various system configurations. Moreover, in addition to the common approaches, where the dependence of rain attenuation induced on multiple links is based solely on the distance between ground stations, elevation and baseline angle are also taken into account for the modeling of the dependence parameter. Both versions of the model outperform the existing model for two-site diversity systems given in the ITU-R Recommendation P.618-12. The version, which accounts for the system's angles, shows a better performance also in comparison with the state-of-the-art models such as the models based on the Archimedean Clayton copula and the Gaussian copula.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rain Attenuation Prediction Model Based on Hyperbolic Cosecant Copula for Multiple Site Diversity Systems in Satellite Communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2017.2726679","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/8024125/07979553.pdf","startPage":"4768","endPage":"4779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2017.2726679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8024125","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979553","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979553/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Rain Attenuation Prediction Model Based on Hyperbolic Cosecant Copula for Multiple Site Diversity Systems in Satellite Communications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7979553/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17155484","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000844","fundingName":"European Space Agency in the framework of the ESA-PECS program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004329","fundingName":"Slovenian Research Agency","grantNumber":"P2-0016"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rain Attenuation Prediction Model Based on Hyperbolic Cosecant Copula for Multiple Site Diversity Systems in Satellite Communications","sourcePdf":"tap-vilhar-2726679-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106021S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8024125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8024125","articleId":"7979553","onlineDate":"13 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7979555,"authors":[{"name":"Nafiseh Sedaghat","affiliation":["Computer Engineering School, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8857/8485525/7979555/sedag-2727042-small.gif","p":["Nafiseh Sedaghat received the BS degree in computer engineering from\n the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran, in 2003 and the MS degree in computer engineering specialized in artificial\n intelligence from Islamic Azad University, Mashhad Branch, Iran, in 2010.

MiRNAs have been found to be associated with initiation and progression of many complex diseases. Investigating miRNAs and their targets can thus help develop new therapies by designing anti-miRNA oligonucleotides. While existing computational approaches can predict miRNA targets, these predictions have low accuracy. In this paper, we propose a two-step approach to refine the results of sequence-based prediction algorithms. The first step, which is based on our previous work, uses an ensemble learning approach that combines multiple existing methods. The second step utilizes support vector machine (SVM) classifiers in one- and two-class modes to infer miRNA-mRNA interactions based on both binding features, as well as network features extracted from gene regulatory network. Experimental results using two real data sets from TCGA indicate that the use of two-class SVM classification significantly improves the precision of miRNA-mRNA prediction.","doi":"10.1109/TCBB.2017.2727042","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCBB.2017.2727042","startPage":"1594","endPage":"1604","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8857/8485525/07979555.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8485525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining Supervised and Unsupervised Learning for Improved miRNA Target Prediction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979555/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Combining Supervised and Unsupervised Learning for Improved miRNA Target Prediction","volume":"15","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2018","accessionNumber":"18133026","pubMedId":"28715336","publicationDate":"1 Sept.-Oct. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7979555/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining Supervised and Unsupervised Learning for Improved miRNA Target Prediction","sourcePdf":"tcbb-sedaghat-2727042-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15857S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8857","isNumber":"8485525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8857","xplore-issue":"8485525","articleId":"7979555","onlineDate":"13 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7979557,"authors":[{"name":"Morten Kolb\u00e6k","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570655/8015274/7979557/kolba-2726762-small.gif","p":["Morten Kolbk received the B.Eng. degree in electronic design from\n Business and Social Sciences, Aarhus University, AU Herning, Denmark, in 2013 and the M.Sc. degree in signal\n processing and computing, in 2015, from Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark, where he is currently working toward the\n Ph.D. degree in the Section for Signal and Information Processing, Department of Electronic Systems.

Specifically, uPIT extends the recently proposed permutation invariant training (PIT) technique with an utterance-level cost function, hence eliminating the need for solving an additional permutation problem during inference, which is otherwise required by frame-level PIT. We achieve this using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that, during training, minimize the utterance-level separation error, hence forcing separated frames belonging to the same speaker to be aligned to the same output stream. In practice, this allows RNNs, trained with uPIT, to separate multitalker mixed speech without any prior knowledge of signal duration, number of speakers, speaker identity, or gender. We evaluated uPIT on the WSJ0 and Danish two- and three-talker mixed-speech separation tasks and found that uPIT outperforms techniques based on nonnegative matrix factorization and computational auditory scene analysis, and compares favorably with deep clustering, and the deep attractor network. Furthermore, we found that models trained with uPIT generalize well to unseen speakers and languages. Finally, we found that a single model, trained with uPIT, can handle both two-speaker, and three-speaker speech mixtures.","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2017.2726762","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/8015274/07979557.pdf","startPage":"1901","endPage":"1913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8015274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2017.2726762","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multitalker Speech Separation With Utterance-Level Permutation Invariant Training of Deep Recurrent Neural Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979557","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Multitalker Speech Separation With Utterance-Level Permutation Invariant Training of Deep Recurrent Neural Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979557/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17135554","htmlLink":"/document/7979557/","volume":"25","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007696","fundingName":"Oticon Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multitalker Speech Separation With Utterance-Level Permutation Invariant Training of Deep Recurrent Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"taslp-kolbaek-2726762-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15505S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"8015274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"177","xplore-issue":"8015274","articleId":"7979557","onlineDate":"13 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7979559,"authors":[{"name":"Hai Q.

This paper reports a dual-feature-based object recognition coprocessor that exploits both histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) and Haar-like descriptors with a cell-based parallel sliding-window recognition mechanism. The feature extraction circuitry for HOG and Haar-like descriptors is implemented by a pixel-based pipelined architecture, which synchronizes to the pixel frequency from the image sensor. After extracting each cell feature vector, a cell-based sliding window scheme enables parallelized recognition for all windows, which contain this cell. The nearest neighbor search classifier is, respectively, applied to the HOG and Haar-like feature space. The complementary aspects of the two feature domains enable a hardware-friendly implementation of the binary classification for pedestrian detection with improved accuracy.

The semi-active joints are driven by a regenerative actuator that includes an energy-storing element. Method: External forces can have a large influence on energy regeneration characteristics. Impedance control is used to impose a desired relationship between external forces and deviation from reference trajectories. Multi-objective optimization (MOO) is used to obtain optimal impedance parameters and control gains to compromise between the two conflicting objectives of trajectory tracking and energy regeneration. We solve the MOO problem under two different scenarios: 1) constant impedance; and 2) time-varying impedance. Results: The methods are applied to a transfemoral prosthesis simulation with a semi-active knee joint. Normalized hypervolume and relative coverage are used to compare Pareto fronts, and these two metrics show that time-varying impedance provides better performance than constant impedance. The solution with time-varying impedance with minimum tracking error (0.0008 rad) fails to regenerate energy (loses 9.53 J), while a solution with degradation in tracking (0.0452 rad) regenerates energy (gains 270.3 J). A tradeoff solution results in fair tracking (0.0178 rad) and fair energy regeneration (131.2 J). Conclusion: Our experimental results support the possibility of net energy regeneration at the semi-active knee joint with human-like tracking performance. Significance: The results indicate that advanced control and optimization of ultracapacitor-based systems can significantly reduce power requirements in transfemoral prostheses.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2017.2725740","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/8320025/07979570.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2017.2725740","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8320025","startPage":"894","endPage":"910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Mixed Tracking/Impedance Control With Application to Transfemoral Prostheses With Energy Regeneration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979570","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/10/8320025/7979570-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Mixed Tracking/Impedance Control With Application to Transfemoral Prostheses With Energy Regeneration","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979570/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17633817","pubMedId":"28715322","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7979570/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1344954 and 1536035"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Optimal Mixed Tracking/Impedance Control With Application to Transfemoral Prostheses With Energy Regeneration","sourcePdf":"tbme-khademi-2725740-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132767S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"8320025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8320025","articleId":"7979570","onlineDate":"13 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7979576,"authors":[{"name":"Lotfi Beghou","affiliation":["University of Batna 2, Batna, Algeria"],"firstName":"Lotfi","lastName":"Beghou","orcid":"0000-0003-2610-3852","id":"38190854900"},{"name":"Francois Costa","affiliation":["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan, Cachan, France"],"firstName":"Francois","lastName":"Costa","id":"37275571200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7979576","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":470},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979576","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inductors","Magnetic sensors","Toroidal magnetic fields","Magnetic field measurement","Power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic fields","electromagnetic interference","Fourier transforms","inverse transforms","power convertors","power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power electronic converters","current programed control","buck converter","EMI-based voltage sensing","EMI-based current sensing","electromagnetic field characterization method","electromagnetic interference","inverse Fourier transform","circuit analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power electronic converters","electromagnetic fields","inverse problem","Fourier analysis"]}],"abstract":"In this brief, a new method for current and voltage sensing in power electronic converters is demonstrated.

Such algorithms are based on importance sampling with a bootstrap resampling step, which aims at struggling against weight degeneracy. However, in some situations (informative measurements, high-dimensional model), the resampling step can prove inefficient. In this paper, we revisit the fundamental resampling mechanism, which leads us back to Rubin's static resampling mechanism. We propose an alternative rejuvenation scheme in which the resampled particles share the same marginal distribution as in the classical setup, but are now independent. This set of independent particles provides a new alternative to compute a moment of the target distribution and the resulting estimate is analyzed through a CLT. We next adapt our results to the dynamic case and propose a particle filtering algorithm based on independent resampling. This algorithm can be seen as a particular auxiliary particle filter algorithm with a relevant choice of the first-stage weights and instrumental distributions. Finally, we validate our results via simulations, which carefully take into account the computational budget.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979579/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.15, 15 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7979579/","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2017","publicationDate":"15 Oct.15, 2017","accessionNumber":"17135357","volume":"65","issue":"20","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Independent Resampling Sequential Monte Carlo Algorithms","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Institute of Statistical Mathematics, Tokyo, Japan"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Independent Resampling Sequential Monte Carlo Algorithms","sourcePdf":"tsp-petetin-2726971-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134836S","chronDate":"Oct.15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8004554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8004554","articleId":"7979579","onlineDate":"13 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7979581,"authors":[{"name":"Henry Ramiro Carvajal Mora","affiliation":["Department of Communications, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8103982/7979581/carva-2726778-small.gif","p":["Henry Ramiro Carvajal Mora (S\u201916) was born in Quito, Ecuador.\n He received the B.Sc. degree in electronic and telecommunications engineering from Armed Forces University-ESPE,\n Sangolqu\u00ed, Ecuador, in 2009, the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the School of Electrical and\n Computer Engineering, University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Campinas, Brazil, in 2014, and is currently working toward the\n Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at UNICAMP.

The scenario considers perfect power control, own-cell interference (or multiple access interference-MAI), interference from co-cells (or co-cell interference-CCI), additive white Gaussian noise, exponential path-loss and slow frequency-selective Rayleigh fading. Upper bound expressions to evaluate the mean BER are obtained, which are functions of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the number of users, the spreading factor, and the channel reuse factor. For BPSK and 4-QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation), closed-form expressions involving the analytical calculation of pairwise error probabilities are obtained. For 16-QAM and 64-QAM, we show that the number of pairwise error probabilities needed to obtain the BER can be simplified through the constellations symmetry. The procedure for obtaining this simplification is detailed. Also, by considering BER asymptotes, expressions for the SNR penalty due to MAI are derived. Monte Carlo simulations verify the analytical expressions accuracy. In the simulations, the MU-MLD is implemented through the sphere decoder algorithm with MMSE QR factorization. Results show that MC-CDMA does not lose diversity due to MAI. Moreover, CCI significantly affects the system performance. As a consequence, it produces floors in the BER curves.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2726778","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8103982/07979581.pdf","startPage":"9838","endPage":"9851","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2726778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8103982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mean Bit Error Rate Evaluation of MC-CDMA Cellular Systems Employing Multiuser-Maximum-Likelihood Detector","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Mean Bit Error Rate Evaluation of MC-CDMA Cellular Systems Employing Multiuser-Maximum-Likelihood Detector","volume":"66","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2017","accessionNumber":"17372496","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7979581/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979581/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ecuadorian Secretar\u00eda Nacional de Educaci\u00f3n Superior, Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda"},{"fundingName":"Brazilian Ministry of Education Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de Aperfei\u00e7oamento de Pessoal de N\u00edvel Superior"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mean Bit Error Rate Evaluation of MC-CDMA Cellular Systems Employing Multiuser-Maximum-Likelihood Detector","sourcePdf":"tvt-carvajal-2726778-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118305S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8103982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8103982","articleId":"7979581","onlineDate":"13 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":7979584,"authors":[{"name":"Farideh E.

On the other hand, compressed sensing algorithms recover \u201cstructured\u201d signals from their under-determined set of linear measurements. Currently, there is a noticeable gap between the types of structures used in the area of compressed sensing and those employed by state-of-the-art compression codes. Recent results in the literature on deterministic signals aim at bridging this gap through devising compressed sensing decoders that employ compression codes. This paper focuses on structured stochastic processes and studies application of lossy compression codes to compressed sensing of such signals. The performance of the formerly proposed compressible signal pursuit (CSP) optimization is studied in this stochastic setting. It is proved that in the low-distortion regime, as the blocklength grows to infinity, the CSP optimization reliably and robustly recovers n instances of a stationary process from its random linear measurements as long as n is slightly more than n times the rate-distortion dimension (RDD) of the source. It is also shown that under some regularity conditions, the RDD of a stationary process is equal to its information dimension. This connection establishes the optimality of CSP at least for memoryless stationary sources, which have known fundamental limits. Finally, it is shown that CSP combined by a family of universal variable-length fixed-distortion compression codes yields a family of universal compressed sensing recovery algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compression-Based Compressed Sensing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2017.2726549","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/8036324/07979584.pdf","startPage":"6735","endPage":"6752","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2017.2726549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8036324","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979584","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/18/8036324/7979584-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979584/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Compression-Based Compressed Sensing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7979584/","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17171179","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1420575 and CNS-1619129"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Compression-Based Compressed Sensing","sourcePdf":"tit-ebrahimrezagah-2726549-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.221174S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"8036324","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8036324","articleId":"7979584","onlineDate":"13 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7979586,"authors":[{"name":"Swapnil Deelip Dabhade","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8186327/7979586/dabha-2726960-small.gif","p":["Swapnil Deelip Dabhade (M\u201916) received the M.E. degree in\n system science and automation from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India, in 2016.","He was a Project Intern with the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Ooty, India, during 2012\u20132013, and is\n currently a Systems Engineer with Amagi Media Labs, Bangalore.

However, 2-D period estimation is still a hard problem since it has three parameters to determine: length, width, and direction. Recently, a special kind of 2-D function called 2D-gcd-delta function is proposed. It has close relationship with Ramanujan's sum and the 2-D periodicity matrix. In this paper, we will describe how to use this function to decompose an image into subband signals. Each subband signal will have its own periodicity matrix so we also provide a simple algorithm to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of those subband signal periodicity matrices. Concrete experiments are given to prove the robustness of the proposed 2-D period estimation method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979594/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.1, 1 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7979594/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2017","publicationDate":"1 Oct.1, 2017","accessionNumber":"17136295","volume":"65","issue":"19","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Two-Dimensional Period Estimation by Ramanujan's Sum","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"104-2221-E-002-096-MY3 and 105-2221-E-002-001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Dimensional Period Estimation by Ramanujan's Sum","sourcePdf":"tsp-pei-2726986-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095251S","chronDate":"Oct.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7990282","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7990282","articleId":"7979594","onlineDate":"13 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7979602,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Peng","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Power Station Automation Technology, School of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8186327/7979602/peng-2726965-small.gif","p":["Chen Peng (M\u201913\u2013SM\u201915) received the M.Sc. degree in\n coal preparation and Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from the Chinese University of Mining\n Technology, Xuzhou, China, in 1999 and 2002, respectively.","From September 2002 to August 2004, he was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in applied mathematics with Nanjing Normal\n University, Nanjing, China.

Every other node, called target node (or sensor), can estimate its distances to surrounding anchors according to the received signal strength. Then, trilateration can be employed for self localization. This system is low-cost, simple, and thus popular, but it suffers from two major drawbacks. The first problem is the requirement for realtime channel parameters, which should be estimated and transmitted to target sensors by a central node. Another problem arises from the fact that positioning accuracy is dependent on number of anchors, but anchor density is quite limited for economic consideration in the conventional localization systems. To solve these problem, we proposed in this paper, a new localization framework for wireless sensor networks, which employs a mobile node to serve as virtual anchors. This new framework has two advantages over the conventional one: 1) Offline measurements are totally unnecessary; 2) the number of virtual anchors can be vastly increased with negligible cost, leading to very high positioning accuracy. To justify the superiority of this new framework, extensive analysis and simulations were conducted. Besides, we implemented it on a drone and did field experiments, which showed very promising results.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2726939","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8103982/07979605.pdf","startPage":"10322","endPage":"10335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2726939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8103982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design, Analysis, and Field Testing of an Innovative Drone-Assisted Zero-Configuration Localization Framework for Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979605","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979605/","displayDocTitle":"Design, Analysis, and Field Testing of an Innovative Drone-Assisted Zero-Configuration Localization Framework for Wireless Sensor Networks","volume":"66","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17372497","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7979605/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"293264-12, 397491-10 and 486202-15"},{"fundingName":"Research & Development Corporation Newfoundland and Labrador Sensor TECH Program","grantNumber":"5404-2061-101"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design, Analysis, and Field Testing of an Innovative Drone-Assisted Zero-Configuration Localization Framework for Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-li-2726939-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139387S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8103982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8103982","articleId":"7979605","onlineDate":"13 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7979607,"authors":[{"name":"Rodrigo F.

One of the main factors is the availability of this kind of data. Despite the high availability, very little effort has been placed on the zebra crossing classification problem. In this letter, crowdsourcing systems are exploited in order to enable the automatic acquisition and annotation of a large-scale satellite imagery database for crosswalks related tasks. Then, this data set is used to train deep-learning-based models in order to accurately classify satellite images that contain or not contain zebra crossings. A novel data set with more than 240000 images from 3 continents, 9 countries, and more than 20 cities was used in the experiments. The experimental results showed that freely available crowdsourcing data can be used to accurately (97.11%) train robust models to perform crosswalk classification on a global scale.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979607/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17135382","volume":"14","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7979607/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning-Based Large-Scale Automatic Satellite Crosswalk Classification","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"UFES"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002322","fundingName":"CAPES for the scholarships"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003593","fundingName":"CNPq","grantNumber":"311120/2016-4"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning-Based Large-Scale Automatic Satellite Crosswalk Classification","sourcePdf":"lgrs-berriel-2719863-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046388S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"8016687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8016687","articleId":"7979607","onlineDate":"13 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7979613,"authors":[{"name":"Il-Min Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen\u2019s University, Kingston, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Il-Min","lastName":"Kim","orcid":"0000-0003-1339-8057","id":"37278943200"},{"name":"Byoung-Hoon Kim","affiliation":["LG Electronics, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byoung-Hoon","lastName":"Kim","id":"38516574100"},{"name":"Joon Kui Ahn","affiliation":["LG Electronics, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Joon Kui","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37085855754"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7979613","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":407},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979613","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Reliability","Decoding","Noise measurement","Network security","Physical layer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","data communication","error statistics","source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure polar coding","secure data communication","bit-channels","finite codelength","practical codelength","repetition coding","REP coding","XOR coding","exclusive-OR coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Grey bit-channels","polar coding","REP","XOR"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we study the secure data communication by polar coding. In polar coding, all bit-channels perfectly polarize when the codelength goes to infinity. With finite and practical codelength, however, many bit-channels do not perfectly polarize and this significantly degrades the secrecy rate. To address this issue, we propose to use repetition (REP) coding and exclusive-or (XOR) coding combined with polar coding. To make the proposed approach practical, we develop simple design methods for REP and XOR codings. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed secure polar coding improves the secrecy rate and security gap considerably.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2726523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8063256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2726523","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8063256/07979613.pdf","startPage":"2126","endPage":"2129","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Polar Coding With REP and XOR Coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Secure Polar Coding With REP and XOR Coding","volume":"21","issue":"10","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7979613/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17216537","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979613/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"LGE"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Polar Coding With REP and XOR Coding","sourcePdf":"lcomm-kim-2726523-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072959S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8063256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8063256","articleId":"7979613","onlineDate":"13 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7979615,"authors":[{"name":"Peng-Fa Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/8024125/7979615/li-2726579-small.gif","p":["Peng-Fa Li was born in Sichuan, China, in 1990.

The resistances of the interconnections were measured to be less than one hundredth of an ohm per bump with a test structure. There were, however, a small number of defective micro bumps with much higher impedance among the four million interconnections of the sensor. We developed a method for distinguishing defective interconnections from other defects and evaluated all interconnection resistances in a short amount of time with additional circuits in the CIS with reduced variable factors by using a modified current flow mode. This method makes it possible not only to identify defective interconnections but also to measure their impedances with less fluctuation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel7/66/7997968/07979623.pdf","startPage":"236","endPage":"242","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","doi":"10.1109/TSM.2017.2726536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSM.2017.2726536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7997968","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of 4 Million Micro-Bump Interconnections at 7.6- $\\mu \\text{m}$ Pitch for 3-D Stacked 16 Million Pixel Image Sensor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit interconnections","Substrates","Resistance","Transistors","Electrical resistance measurement","Three-dimensional displays","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","elemental semiconductors","integrated circuit interconnections","silicon","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microbump interconnections","3-D million pixel image sensor","3-D stacked CMOS image sensor","size 7.6 mum","Si"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3-D stacking","micro bump","CMOS image sensor (CIS)","test circuit","global shutter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979623/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of 4 Million Micro-Bump Interconnections at 7.6- $\\mu \\text{m}$ Pitch for 3-D Stacked 16 Million Pixel Image Sensor","volume":"30","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7979623/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17136407","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of 4 Million Micro-Bump Interconnections at 7.6- $\\mu \\text{m}$ Pitch for 3-D Stacked 16 Million Pixel Image Sensor","sourcePdf":"tsm-takemoto-2726536-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086019S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"66","isNumber":"7997968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7997968","articleId":"7979623","onlineDate":"13 July 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7979625,"authors":[{"name":"John H.

These temporarily-missing communications capabilities are crucial to rescuers and affected citizens as the responders need to effectively coordinate and communicate to minimize the loss of lives and property. A cyber-physical system (CPS) is composed of integrated communication, computation and physical objects, and cyber-physical vehicle systems (CPVSs) are an emerging field due to the rapid advancements on real-time computing, mobile communications and autonomous control in intelligent transport systems. In this paper, we propose a cyber-physical buses-and-drones mobiLe edge infrastructure (AidLife) for disaster emergency communications, which aims at a rapidly deployable resilient system capable of supporting flexible communications to serve large-scale disaster situations by utilizing the existing public transport system. In particular we envision a proposal where public buses can be recruited to temporarily host portable base station (BS) and computation units as well as power resources so as to form a buses-based mobile edge infrastructure, and also accommodate drones to extend their coverage to hard-to-reach areas. Our preliminary results show that the AidLife system can guarantee a good coverage to users, even when a large number of normal BSs that are damaged.","doi":"10.1109/ICDCSW.2017.41","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7976700/7979754/07979795.pdf","startPage":"53","endPage":"60","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCSW.2017.41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7979754","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cyber Physical Buses-and-Drones Mobile Edge Infrastructure for Large Scale Disaster Emergency Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Cyber Physical Buses-and-Drones Mobile Edge Infrastructure for Large Scale Disaster Emergency Communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979795/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7979795/","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17043478","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cyber Physical Buses-and-Drones Mobile Edge Infrastructure for Large Scale Disaster Emergency Communications","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"6173a053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081621S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7976700","isNumber":"7979754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7976700","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7979754","articleId":"7979795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":7979808,"authors":[{"name":"Julien Gedeon","affiliation":["Telecooperation Lab, Technische Universit\u00e4t, Darmstadt"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Gedeon","id":"37085667559"},{"name":"Christian Meurisch","affiliation":["Telecooperation Lab, Technische Universit\u00e4t, Darmstadt"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Meurisch","id":"37086054507"},{"name":"Disha Bhat","affiliation":["Telecooperation Lab, Technische Universit\u00e4t, Darmstadt"],"firstName":"Disha","lastName":"Bhat","id":"37086079240"},{"name":"Michael Stein","affiliation":["Telecooperation Lab, Technische Universit\u00e4t, Darmstadt"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Stein","id":"37085678924"},{"name":"Lin Wang","affiliation":["Telecooperation Lab, Technische Universit\u00e4t, Darmstadt"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086000140"},{"name":"Max M\u00fchlh\u00e4user","affiliation":["Telecooperation Lab, Technische Universit\u00e4t, Darmstadt"],"firstName":"Max","lastName":"M\u00fchlh\u00e4user","id":"37328724600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3292-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3293-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5666"}],"articleNumber":"7979808","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":279},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979808","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Urban areas","Servers","Cloud computing","Standards","Performance evaluation","Edge computing","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["router-based brokering","surrogate discovery","edge computing","in-network processing","computational capabilities","location-aware applications","real-time applications","heterogeneous usage contexts","mobile usage contexts","standard home routers","cloud-based solutions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Edge Computing","Surrogate Discovery","Router","Fog Computing","In-Network Processing"]}],"abstract":"In-network processing pushes computational capabilities closer to the edge of the network, enabling new kinds of location-aware, real-time applications, while preserving bandwidth in the core network. This is done by offloading computations to more powerful or energy-efficient surrogates that are opportunistically available at the network edge. In mobile and heterogeneous usage contexts, the question arises how a client can discover the most appropriate surrogate in the network for offloading a task. In this paper, we propose a brokering mechanism that matches a client with the best available surrogate, based on specified requirements and capabilities. The broker is implemented on standard home routers, and thus, leverages the ubiquity of such devices in urban environments. To motivate the feasibility of this approach, we conduct a coverage analysis based on collected access point locations in a major city. Furthermore, the brokering functionality introduces only a minimal resource overhead on the routers and can significantly reduce the latency compared to distant, cloud-based solutions.","doi":"10.1109/ICDCSW.2017.61","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7979754","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCSW.2017.61","endPage":"150","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7976700/7979754/07979808.pdf","startPage":"145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Router-Based Brokering for Surrogate Discovery in Edge Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979808/","displayDocTitle":"Router-Based Brokering for Surrogate Discovery in Edge Computing","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2017","accessionNumber":"17043475","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7979808/","publicationDate":"June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Router-Based Brokering for Surrogate Discovery in Edge Computing","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"6173a145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113999S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7976700","isNumber":"7979754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7976700","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7979754","articleId":"7979808","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7979813,"authors":[{"name":"Samar Abbas","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Samar","lastName":"Abbas","id":"37086102331"},{"name":"Juvaria Tariq","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Juvaria","lastName":"Tariq","id":"37086105026"},{"name":"Arif Zaman","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Arif","lastName":"Zaman","id":"37086104099"},{"name":"Imdadullah Khan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Imdadullah","lastName":"Khan","id":"37086104009"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3292-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3293-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5666"}],"articleNumber":"7979813","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979813","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Approximation algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Computational modeling","Complexity theory","Upper bound","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","graph theory","greedy algorithms","matrix algebra","optimisation","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling based efficient algorithm","spectral radius","extremely useful graph property","absolute eigenvalue","graph adjacency matrix","distributed storage","remote storage","vertex contribution","budgeted optimization problem","greedy algorithm","analytical bound","computational complexity","synthetic graphs","real-world graphs","spectral graph theory literature"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spectral Analysis","Approximation Algorithms","Sampling"]}],"abstract":"Evaluating an extremely useful graph property, the spectral radius (largest absolute eigenvalue of the graph adjacency matrix), for large graphs requires excessive computing resources. This problem becomes especially challenging, for instance with distributed or remote storage, when accessing the whole graph itself is expensive in terms of memory or bandwidth. One approach to tackle this challenge is to estimate the spectral radius of the graph while reading only a small portion of the graph. In this paper we present a sampling approach to estimate the spectral radius of large graphs. We define a score for vertices that i) is more of a combinatorial nature and is easier to compute and ii) has solid theoretical justifications hence, it closely approximate a vertex's contribution to the largest eigenvalue of the graph. Using this score, we model the sampling problem as a budgeted optimization problem and design a greedy algorithm to select a subgraph whose spectral radius approaches that of the whole graph. We provide analytical bound on computational complexity of our algorithm. We demonstrate effectiveness of our algorithm on various synthetic and real-world graphs and show that our algorithm also empirically outperforms known techniques. Furthermore, we compare the quality of our results to estimates obtained from well known upper and lower bounds known in the spectral graph theory literature.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7979754","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCSW.2017.71","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7976700/7979754/07979813.pdf","startPage":"175","endPage":"180","doi":"10.1109/ICDCSW.2017.71","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling Based Efficient Algorithm to Estimate the Spectral Radius of Large Graphs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Sampling Based Efficient Algorithm to Estimate the Spectral Radius of Large Graphs","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7979813/","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17043441","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979813/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling Based Efficient Algorithm to Estimate the Spectral Radius of Large Graphs","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"6173a175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084194S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7976700","isNumber":"7979754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7976700","xplore-issue":"7979754","articleId":"7979813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7979817,"authors":[{"name":"Hang Cai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Cai","id":"37085863272"},{"name":"Tianlong Yun","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH"],"firstName":"Tianlong","lastName":"Yun","id":"37086034090"},{"name":"Josiah Hester","affiliation":["School of Computing, Clemson University, Clemson, SC"],"firstName":"Josiah","lastName":"Hester","id":"37078440700"},{"name":"Krishna K.

Security is essential for WIoT environments. Lack of security in WIoTs not only harms user privacy, but may also harm the user's safety. Though devices in the WIoT can be attacked in many ways, in this paper we focus on adversaries who mount what we call sensor-hijacking attacks, which prevent the constituent medical devices from accurately collecting and reporting the user's health state (e.g., reporting old or wrong physiological measurements). In this paper we outline some of our experiences in implementing a data-driven security solution for detecting sensor-hijacking attack on a secure wearable internet-of-things (WIoT) base station called the Amulet. Given the limited capabilities (computation, memory, battery power) of the Amulet platform, implementing such a security solution is quite challenging and presents several trade-offs with respect to detection accuracy and resources requirements. We conclude the paper with a list of insights into what capabilities constrained WIoT platforms should provide developers so as to make the inclusion of data-driven security primitives in such systems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7979754","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCSW.2017.15","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7976700/7979754/07979817.pdf","startPage":"199","endPage":"204","doi":"10.1109/ICDCSW.2017.15","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deploying Data-Driven Security Solutions on Resource-Constrained Wearable IoT Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Deploying Data-Driven Security Solutions on Resource-Constrained Wearable IoT Systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7979817/","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17043437","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979817/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deploying Data-Driven Security Solutions on Resource-Constrained Wearable IoT Systems","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"6173a199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059922S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7976700","isNumber":"7979754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7976700","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7979754","articleId":"7979817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7979825,"authors":[{"name":"Christine Chen","affiliation":["Shiley School of Engineering, University of Portland, Portland, OR"],"firstName":"Christine","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086106778"},{"name":"James Gurganus","affiliation":["Manager & Architect, Data Center Services Micro Systems Engineering Inc., Lake Oswego, OR"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Gurganus","id":"37086103102"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3292-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3293-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5666"}],"articleNumber":"7979825","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"abstract":"As a company grows, its infrastructure naturally must grow to support it. The resulting mountains of infrastructure metadata contain valuable information on the health and wellbeing of a company's systems. For example, an abnormally low disk write rate to a file server may indicate that a regularly scheduled task has failed to start. The hypothesis of this case study is that such metadata streams can be effectively utilized by implementing statistical anomaly detection methods via commodity software (Splunk, in this case). These methods were tested on server metadata in a ransomware simulation and on server metadata from active file and production servers. In the ransomware simulation, the alerting system detected the ransomware behavior five minutes after an encryption event began in the simulation environment and alerted steadily for the duration of the simulation. In the week-long experiment over 11 file servers and production servers, a total of 1,484 alerts were generated. Applying simple correlation techniques created a more concentrated information stream with 77 events. These results confirm the value of metadata in identifying system anomalies and providing another layer of defense against malicious threats. The relatively simple anomaly detection techniques highlight the increasing practicality of behavioral analytics-it can only be a matter of time before such techniques will be ubiquitous.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7976700/7979754/07979825.pdf","startPage":"252","endPage":"257","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW)","doi":"10.1109/ICDCSW.2017.53","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCSW.2017.53","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7979754","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979825","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Anomaly Detection on Metadata Streams via Commodity Software to Protect Company Infrastructure: A Case Study","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Metadata","File servers","Servers","Companies","Production","Encryption","Entropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","cryptography","data protection","file servers","meta data","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ransomware simulation","alerting system","ransomware behavior","encryption event","simulation environment","file servers","production servers","correlation techniques","concentrated information stream","malicious threats","infrastructure metadata stream","commodity software","statistical anomaly detection","company infrastructure protection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Statistical Anomaly Detection","Enterprise Infrastructure","Ransomware","Commodity Software"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979825/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Anomaly Detection on Metadata Streams via Commodity Software to Protect Company Infrastructure: A Case Study","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7979825/","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17043470","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Anomaly Detection on Metadata Streams via Commodity Software to Protect Company Infrastructure: A Case Study","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"6173a252.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044765S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7976700","isNumber":"7979754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7976700","xplore-issue":"7979754","articleId":"7979825","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7979829,"authors":[{"name":"Fanghua Ye","affiliation":["School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Fanghua","lastName":"Ye","id":"37086185574"},{"name":"Zibin Zheng","affiliation":["School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zibin","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37085397567"},{"name":"Chuan Chen","affiliation":["School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chuan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086185877"},{"name":"Yuren Zhou","affiliation":["School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yuren","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086090069"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3292-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3293-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5666"}],"articleNumber":"7979829","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":391},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979829","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Ecosystems","Collaboration","Computational modeling","Quality of service","Computer architecture","Phase change materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint-cloud computing","DC-RSF","dynamic-and-customized reputation system framework","cloud ecosystem","cloud service vendors","virtual clouds","low-quality cloud resources","JointCloud ecosystem","customized-and-dynamic credibility model","CDCM","blockchain-based module"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reputation Systems","Credibility Model","Joint Cloud Computing"]}],"abstract":"Joint cloud computing (JointCloud), as a brand-new paradigm of cloud computing, aims at building a cloud ecosystem, in which end users are agnostic to cloud service vendors as applications and services are built upon virtual clouds.

We further incorporate a Blockchain-based module into DC-RSF to prevent the credit value from being artificially tampered.","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7976700/7979754/07979829.pdf","startPage":"275","endPage":"279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCSW.2017.21","doi":"10.1109/ICDCSW.2017.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7979754","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DC-RSF: A Dynamic and Customized Reputation System Framework for Joint Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"DC-RSF: A Dynamic and Customized Reputation System Framework for Joint Cloud Computing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979829/","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7979829/","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17043448","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DC-RSF: A Dynamic and Customized Reputation System Framework for Joint Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"6173a275.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07636S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7976700","isNumber":"7979754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7976700","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7979754","articleId":"7979829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7979833,"authors":[{"name":"Fu Xiang","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Parallel and Distributed Laboratory, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Fu","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37086167563"},{"name":"Wang Huaimin","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Parallel and Distributed Laboratory, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Huaimin","id":"37371358500"},{"name":"Shi Peichang","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Parallel and Distributed Laboratory, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Shi","lastName":"Peichang","id":"37085875561"},{"name":"Fu Yingwei","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Parallel and Distributed Laboratory, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Fu","lastName":"Yingwei","id":"37086167071"},{"name":"Wang Yijie","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Parallel and Distributed Laboratory, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Yijie","id":"37595114900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3292-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3293-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5666"}],"articleNumber":"7979833","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1124},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979833","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peer-to-peer computing","Cloud computing","Bitcoin","Routing","Economics","Globalization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accounts data processing","cloud computing","cryptography","globalisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blockchain based distributed ledger","JointCloud computing","JCLedger","economic globalization","cloud service providers","cross-cloud services","CCP","cryptocurrency provider","JointCloud collaboration environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["JointCloud","blockchain","distributed ledger"]}],"abstract":"With the development of Economic Globalization, traditional single-cloud providers can not meet the needs of the explosive, global, diverse cloud services.

There is a growing trend to build an environment of cloud service, with the capacity to serve anytime and anywhere, by mutual cooperation between cloud service providers around the world. However, this tendency will raise a key issue which is how to provide a benign environment, that allows self-collaboration and fair competition, for different cloud service providers with diverse stakeholder. Inspired by the concept and structure of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) service, this paper proposes a structure named JointCloud Corporation Environment (JCCE), which offers a mutual benefit and win-win JointCloud environment for global cloud service providers. JCCE contains three core services, which are Distributed Cloud Transaction, Distributed Cloud Community and Distributed Cloud Supervision. Also, facing with different cloud service participants, JCCE offers three main service modes for their consumption, supply and coordination. This study plays a significant role in supporting the sharing and self-collaboration of multiple cloud entities, and promoting the development of cloud service market healthy and orderly.","doi":"10.1109/ICDCSW.2017.9","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7976700/7979754/07979834.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCSW.2017.9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7979754","startPage":"294","endPage":"298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Corporation Architecture for Multiple Cloud Service Providers in JointCloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979834","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Corporation Architecture for Multiple Cloud Service Providers in JointCloud Computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979834/","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17043463","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7979834/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Corporation Architecture for Multiple Cloud Service Providers in JointCloud Computing","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"6173a294.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080633S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7976700","isNumber":"7979754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7976700","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7979754","articleId":"7979834","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7979838,"authors":[{"name":"Zexun Jiang","affiliation":["Research Institute of Information Technology, Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Zexun","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37086113260"},{"name":"Hao Yin","affiliation":["Research Institute of Information Technology, Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Yin","id":"37276763900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3292-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3293-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5666"}],"articleNumber":"7979838","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979838","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","Servers","Algorithm design and analysis","Cloud computing","Routing","Industries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication network routing","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive routing algorithm","joint cloud video delivery","content delivery network","request routing algorithm","live video","video-on-demand delivery service"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive Routing","Video On Demand","Content Delivery Network","JointCloud Computing"]}],"abstract":"As the Internet keeps growing, online video has become a great part of the current Internet data traffic, which will take over 80% of Internet traffic according to Cisco's report. Also, new and more heavyweight applications keep developing to fulfill people's growing requirements, like 4k resolution and visual reality videos. However, one single service provider, like a Content Delivery Network (CDN), can not meet the performance requirements completely. To employ the potential of Joint Cloud, this paper designs and implements a new request routing algorithm that can make video delivery utilize multiple clouds and servers. On the premise of guaranteeing the quality of video playing, this algorithm minimizes the cost of service resources based on different infrastructures' service quality, cost, and cover areas. Based on this algorithm, we implement a practical video delivery system using light-weight, flash-based terminals. And this system provides live video and video-on-demand delivery service for China Future Networks Industry Summit 2014 on June 4th. The actual user data was gathered and analyzed to verify the effectiveness of this algorithm. 90.2% of the total VOD requests were completed smoothly without pause, and the video traffic was optimized by the algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICDCSW.2017.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7979754","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCSW.2017.33","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7976700/7979754/07979838.pdf","startPage":"316","endPage":"319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Routing Algorithm for Joint Cloud Video Delivery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Routing Algorithm for Joint Cloud Video Delivery","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7979838/","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17043449","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979838/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Routing Algorithm for Joint Cloud Video Delivery","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"6173a316.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043565S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7976700","isNumber":"7979754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7976700","xplore-issue":"7979754","articleId":"7979838","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":7979855,"authors":[{"name":"Garrett McGrath","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana"],"firstName":"Garrett","lastName":"McGrath","id":"37086066720"},{"name":"Paul R.

Training a deep network is usually a very time-consuming process. To address the huge computational challenge in deep learning, many tools exploit hardware features such as multi-core CPUs and many-core GPUs to shorten the training and inference time. However, different tools exhibit different features and running performance when they train different types of deep networks on different hardware platforms, making it difficult for end users to select an appropriate pair of software and hardware. In this paper, we present our attempt to benchmark several state-of-the-art GPU-accelerated deep learning software tools, including Caffe, CNTK, TensorFlow, and Torch. We focus on evaluating the running time performance (i.e., speed) of these tools with three popular types of neural networks on two representative CPU platforms and three representative GPU platforms. Our contribution is two-fold. First, for end users of deep learning software tools, our benchmarking results can serve as a reference to selecting appropriate hardware platforms and software tools.

To solve this question, we propose a precoding based on weighted symmetric successive over relaxation (WSSOR) method to approximate the matrix inversion.

Gaussian filter is mainly used for edge-preserving smoothing. Empirical parameter is introduced to adaptively adjust the overexposed luminance image after mapping. Multiple regression models are utilized to link the empirical parameter to image information which is the mean, logarithm mean and variance of luminance values.

It provides high resiliency with low storage overhead, which makes it very attractive to storage systems developers. Unfortunately, when used in a distributed setting, erasure coding hampers a storage system's performance, because it requires clients to contact several, possibly remote sites to retrieve their data. This has hindered the adoption of erasure coding in practice, limiting its use to cold, archival data. Recent research showed that it is feasible to use erasure coding for hot data as well, thus opening new perspectives for improving erasure-coded storage systems. In this paper, we address the problem of minimizing access latency in erasure-coded storage. We propose Agar-a novel caching system tailored for erasure-coded content. Agar optimizes the contents of the cache based on live information regarding data popularity and access latency to different data storage sites. Our system adapts a dynamic programming algorithm to optimize the choice of data blocks that are cached, using an approach akin to \"Knapsack\" algorithms. We compare Agar to the classical Least Recently Used and Least Frequently Used cache eviction policies, while varying the amount of data cached between a data chunk and a whole replica of the object. We show that Agar can achieve 16% to 41% lower latency than systems that use classical caching policies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Agar: A Caching System for Erasure-Coded Data","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS.2017.97","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7976702/7979941/07979952.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2017.97","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7979941","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979952","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979952/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Agar: A Caching System for Erasure-Coded Data","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7979952/","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17043656","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Agar: A Caching System for Erasure-Coded Data","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"1792a023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057148S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7976702","isNumber":"7979941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7976702","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7979941","articleId":"7979952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7979974,"authors":[{"name":"Utsav Drolia","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Utsav","lastName":"Drolia","id":"38076099700"},{"name":"Katherine Guo","affiliation":["Nokia Bell Labs"],"firstName":"Katherine","lastName":"Guo","id":"37284860700"},{"name":"Jiaqi Tan","affiliation":["Nokia Bell Labs"],"firstName":"Jiaqi","lastName":"Tan","id":"37085512285"},{"name":"Rajeev Gandhi","affiliation":["Nokia Bell Labs"],"firstName":"Rajeev","lastName":"Gandhi","id":"37430682200"},{"name":"Priya Narasimhan","affiliation":["Nokia Bell Labs"],"firstName":"Priya","lastName":"Narasimhan","id":"37273313700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1792-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1793-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6927"}],"articleNumber":"7979974","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1739},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Computational modeling","Servers","Cloud computing","Feature extraction","Edge computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","file servers","image recognition","minimisation","mobile computing","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Cachier system","edge caching","image recognition","mobile applications","edge servers","cache latency","caching model","optimizations","latency minimization","load balancing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["edge computing","cache","image recognition","mobile"]}],"abstract":"Recognition and perception based mobile applications, such as image recognition, are on the rise. These applications recognize the user's surroundings and augment it with information and/or media. These applications are latency-sensitive. They have a soft-realtime nature - late results are potentially meaningless. On the one hand, given the compute-intensive nature of the tasks performed by such applications, execution is typically offloaded to the cloud. On the other hand, offloading such applications to the cloud incurs network latency, which can increase the user-perceived latency. Consequently, edge computing has been proposed to let devices offload intensive tasks to edge servers instead of the cloud, to reduce latency. In this paper, we propose a different model for using edge servers. We propose to use the edge as a specialized cache for recognition applications and formulate the expected latency for such a cache. We show that using an edge server like a typical web cache, for recognition applications, can lead to higher latencies. We propose Cachier, a system that uses the caching model along with novel optimizations to minimize latency by adaptively balancing load between the edge and the cloud, by leveraging spatiotemporal locality of requests, using offline analysis of applications, and online estimates of network conditions. We evaluate Cachier for image-recognition applications and show that our techniques yield 3x speedup in responsiveness, and perform accurately over a range of operating conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that models edge servers as caches for compute-intensive recognition applications, and Cachier is the first system that uses this model to minimize latency for these applications.","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS.2017.94","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7976702/7979941/07979974.pdf","startPage":"276","endPage":"286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7979941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2017.94","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cachier: Edge-Caching for Recognition Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979974","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Cachier: Edge-Caching for Recognition Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979974/","publicationDate":"June 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17043787","htmlLink":"/document/7979974/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cachier: Edge-Caching for Recognition Applications","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"1792a276.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071235S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7976702","isNumber":"7979941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7976702","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7979941","articleId":"7979974","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7979975,"authors":[{"name":"Xinong Song","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing"],"firstName":"Xinong","lastName":"Song","id":"37086042479"},{"name":"Yaodong Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stony Brook University, New York"],"firstName":"Yaodong","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086042637"},{"name":"Qian Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stony Brook University, New York"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085846045"},{"name":"Fan Ye","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stony Brook University, New York"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Ye","id":"37085350395"},{"name":"Yuanyuan Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stony Brook University, New York"],"firstName":"Yuanyuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085345036"},{"name":"Xiaoming Li","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Li","id":"37065190200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1792-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1793-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6927"}],"articleNumber":"7979975","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":839},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979975","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Metadata","Peer-to-peer computing","Receivers","Robustness","Mobile handsets","Ad hoc networks","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","Internet","mobile computing","peer-to-peer computing","query processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content centric peer data sharing","content centric PDS","pervasive edge computing","mobile devices","peer edge devices","data retrieval","queries","mixedcast","enroute message rewriting","caching","data discovery"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Peer Data Sharing","Mobile Sensing","Data Discovery","Data Retrieval"]}],"abstract":"The proliferation and daily congregation of modern mobile devices have created abundant opportunities for peer edge devices to share valuable data with each other. The short contact durations, relatively small sharing sizes, and uncertain data availability, demand agile, light weight peer based data sharing. In this paper, we propose Peer Data Sharing (PDS) that enables edge devices to discover which data exist in nearby peers, and retrieve interested data robustly and efficiently. PDS uses novel lingering queries, mixedcast and en-route message rewriting techniques to minimize redundant transmissions and maximize opportunistic overhearing thus caching in data discovery and retrieval. Extensive evaluations based on an Android prototype show that PDS discovers and retrieves almost 100% data in tens of seconds, and remains robust despite wireless contention, simultaneous consumer requests and user mobility.","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS.2017.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7979941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2017.26","endPage":"297","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7976702/7979941/07979975.pdf","startPage":"287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Content Centric Peer Data Sharing in Pervasive Edge Computing Environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979975/","displayDocTitle":"Content Centric Peer Data Sharing in Pervasive Edge Computing Environments","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2017","accessionNumber":"17043638","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7979975/","publicationDate":"June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Content Centric Peer Data Sharing in Pervasive Edge Computing Environments","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"1792a287.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.125695S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7976702","isNumber":"7979941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7976702","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7979941","articleId":"7979975","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7979979,"authors":[{"name":"Surat Teerapittayanon","affiliation":["Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Surat","lastName":"Teerapittayanon","id":"37085413073"},{"name":"Bradley McDanel","affiliation":["Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Bradley","lastName":"McDanel","id":"37085758618"},{"name":"H.T.

While being able to accommodate inference of a deep neural network (DNN) in the cloud, a DDNN also allows fast and localized inference using shallow portions of the neural network at the edge and end devices. When supported by a scalable distributed computing hierarchy, a DDNN can scale up in neural network size and scale out in geographical span. Due to its distributed nature, DDNNs enhance sensor fusion, system fault tolerance and data privacy for DNN applications. In implementing a DDNN, we map sections of a DNN onto a distributed computing hierarchy. By jointly training these sections, we minimize communication and resource usage for devices and maximize usefulness of extracted features which are utilized in the cloud. The resulting system has built-in support for automatic sensor fusion and fault tolerance. As a proof of concept, we show a DDNN can exploit geographical diversity of sensors to improve object recognition accuracy and reduce communication cost. In our experiment, compared with the traditional method of offloading raw sensor data to be processed in the cloud, DDNN locally processes most sensor data on end devices while achieving high accuracy and is able to reduce the communication cost by a factor of over 20x.","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS.2017.226","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems

learning (RL), have been applied to (partially) solve the resource allocation problem adaptively in the cloud computing system. However, a complete cloud resource allocation framework exhibits high dimensions in state and action spaces, which prohibit the usefulness of traditional RL techniques. In addition, high power consumption has become one of the critical concerns in design and control of cloud computing systems, which degrades system reliability and increases cooling cost. An effective dynamic power management (DPM) policy should minimize power consumption while maintaining performance degradation within an acceptable level. Thus, a joint virtual machine (VM) resource allocation and power management framework is critical to the overall cloud computing system. Moreover, novel solution framework is necessary to address the even higher dimensions in state and action spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical framework for solving the overall resource allocation and power management problem in cloud computing systems. The proposed hierarchical framework comprises a global tier for VM resource allocation to the servers and a local tier for distributed power management of local servers. The emerging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique, which can deal with complicated control problems with large state space, is adopted to solve the global tier problem. Furthermore, an autoencoder and a novel weight sharing structure are adopted to handle the high-dimensional state space and accelerate the convergence speed. On the other hand, the local tier of distributed server power managements comprises an LSTM based workload predictor and a model-free RL based power manager, operating in a distributed manner. Experiment results using actual Google cluster traces show that our proposed hierarchical framework significantly saves the power consumption and energy usage than the baseline while achieving no severe latency degradation. Meanwhile, the proposed framework can achieve the best trade-off between latency and power/energy consumption in a server cluster.","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS.2017.123","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7976702/7979941/07979983.pdf","startPage":"372","endPage":"382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7979941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2017.123","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hierarchical Framework of Cloud Resource Allocation and Power Management Using Deep Reinforcement Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979983","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Hierarchical Framework of Cloud Resource Allocation and Power Management Using Deep Reinforcement Learning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979983/","publicationDate":"June 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17043661","htmlLink":"/document/7979983/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hierarchical Framework of Cloud Resource Allocation and Power Management Using Deep Reinforcement Learning","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"1792a372.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114506S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7976702","isNumber":"7979941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7976702","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"7979941","articleId":"7979983","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7979986,"authors":[{"name":"Yuxiao Hou","affiliation":["Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Yuxiao","lastName":"Hou","id":"37085415498"},{"name":"Yanwen Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Yanwen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086132864"},{"name":"Yuanqing Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Yuanqing","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37716870000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1792-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1793-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6927"}],"articleNumber":"7979986","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":770},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Radiofrequency identification","Frequency measurement","Biomedical monitoring","Doppler effect","Phase measurement","Backscatter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backscatter","pneumodynamics","protocols","radiofrequency identification","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TagBreathe","commodity RFID systems","chronic diseases","breath monitoring technologies","nasal probes","chest bands","wireless sensing technologies","radio waves","commercial-off-the-shelf","COTS","passive lightweight RFID tags","backscatter radio waves","commodity RFID readers","phase values","periodic body movement","data streams","EPC protocol"]}],"abstract":"Breath monitoring helps assess the general personal health and gives clues to chronic diseases. Yet current breath monitoring technologies are inconvenient and intrusive. For instance, typical breath monitoring devices need to attach nasal probes or chest bands to users. Wireless sensing technologies have been applied to monitor breathing using radio waves without physical contact. Those wireless sensing technologies however require customized radios which are not readily available. More importantly, due to interference, such technologies do not work well with multiple users. With multiple users in presence, the detection accuracy of existing systems decreases dramatically. In this paper, we propose to monitor users' breathing using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) RFID systems. In our system, passive lightweight RFID tags are attached to users' clothes and backscatter radio waves, and commodity RFID readers report low level data (e.g., phase values). We track periodic body movement due to inhaling and exhaling by analyzing the low level data reported by commodity readers. To enhance the measurement robustness, we synthesize data streams from an array of multiple tags to improve the monitoring accuracy. Our design follows the standard EPC protocol which arbitrates collisions in the presence of multiple tags. We implement a prototype the breath monitoring system with commodity RFID systems. The experiment results show that the prototype system can simultaneously monitor breathing with high accuracy even with the presence of multiple users.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TagBreathe: Monitor Breathing with Commodity RFID Systems","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS.2017.76","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7976702/7979941/07979986.pdf","startPage":"404","endPage":"413","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2017.76","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7979941","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7979986","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7979986/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"TagBreathe: Monitor Breathing with Commodity RFID Systems","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7979986/","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17043641","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TagBreathe: Monitor Breathing with Commodity RFID Systems","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"1792a404.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108193S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7976702","isNumber":"7979941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7976702","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"7979941","articleId":"7979986","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"}]
