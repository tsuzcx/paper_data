The discussion of high-fidelity acoustic modeling is posited in the context of general statistical pattern recognition, in which the probabilistic-modeling component that embeds partial, imperfect knowledge is the fundamental building block enabling all other components including recognition error measure, decision rule, and training criterion. Within the session\u2019s theme of acoustic modeling and robust speech recognition, I advance my argument using two concrete examples. First, an acoustic-modeling framework which embeds the knowledge of articulatory-like constraints is shown to be better able to account for the speech variability arising from varying speaking behavior (e.g., speaking rate and style) than without the use of the constraints. This higher-fidelity acoustic model is implemented in a multi-layer dynamic Bayesian network and computer simulation results are presented. Second, the variability in the acoustically distorted speech under adverse environments can be more precisely represented and more effectively handled using the information about phase asynchrony between the un-distorted speech and the mixing noise than without using such information. This high-fidelity, phase-sensitive acoustic distortion model is integrated into the same multi-layer Bayesian network but at separate, causally related layers from those representing the speaking-behavior variability. Related experimental results in the literature are reviewed, providing empirical support to the significant roles that the phase-sensitive model plays in environment-robust speech recognition.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4430075/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 Dec. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4430075/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Roles of high-fidelity acoustic modeling in robust speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Roles of high-fidelity acoustic modeling in robust speech recognition","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01092008-00007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.237346S","chronDate":"9-13 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4430067","isNumber":"4430068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4430067","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4430068","articleId":"4430075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4430079,"authors":[{"name":"Chuan-Wei Ting","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chuan-Wei Ting","id":"37582174100"},{"name":"Jen-Tzung Chien","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jen-Tzung Chien","id":"37269128300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1745-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1746-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4430079","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Cepstral analysis","Speech recognition","Speech analysis","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","Performance analysis","Decoding","Topology","Statistics","Information analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","feature extraction","Gaussian processes","hidden Markov models","speech coding","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["factor analysis","acoustic features","streamed hidden Markov modeling","speech recognition","Markov chains","speech frame","decoding algorithm","multivariate Gaussian mixture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["factor analysis","Markov chain","streamed HMM","speech recognition"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new streamed hidden Markov model (HMM) framework for speech recognition. The factor analysis (FA) is performed to discover the common factors of acoustic features. The streaming regularities are governed by the correlation between features, which is inherent in common factors. Those features corresponding to the same factor are generated by identical HMM state. Accordingly, we use multiple Markov chains to represent the variation trends in cepstral features. We develop a FA streamed HMM (FASHMM) and go beyond the conventional HMM assuming that all features at a speech frame conduct the same state emission. This streamed HMM is more delicate than the factorial HMM where the streaming was empirically determined. We also exploit a new decoding algorithm for FASHMM speech recognition. In this manner, we fulfill the flexible Markov chains for an input sequence of multivariate Gaussian mixture observations. In the experiments, the proposed method can reduce word error rate by 36% at most.","doi":"10.1109/ASRU.2007.4430079","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition & Understanding (ASRU)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition & Understanding (ASRU)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4430067/4430068/04430079.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"35","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.2007.4430079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4430068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Factor analysis of acoustic features for streamed hidden Markov modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4430079","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4430079/","displayDocTitle":"Factor analysis of acoustic features for streamed hidden Markov modeling","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9832783","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4430079/","conferenceDate":"9-13 Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Factor analysis of acoustic features for streamed hidden Markov modeling","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01092008-00011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051976S","chronDate":"9-13 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4430067","isNumber":"4430068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4430067","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4430068","articleId":"4430079","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4430084,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.F.

However, standard model-based compensation techniques do not modify the feature-space in which the diagonal covariance matrix Gaussian mixture models are estimated. One solution to this problem, which yields good performance, is joint uncertainty decoding (JUD) with full transforms. Unfortunately, this results in a high computational cost during decoding. This paper contrasts two approaches to approximating full JUD while lowering the computational cost. Both use predictive linear transforms to modify the feature-space: adaptation-based linear transforms, where the model parameters are restricted to be the same as the original clean system; and precision matrix modelling approaches, in particular semi-tied covariance matrices. These predictive transforms are estimated using statistics derived from the full JUD transforms rather than noisy data. The schemes are evaluated on AURORA 2 and a noise-corrupted resource management task.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4430084/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9821951","htmlLink":"/document/4430084/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Predictive linear transforms for noise robust speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive linear transforms for noise robust speech recognition","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01092008-00016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05005S","chronDate":"9-13 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4430067","isNumber":"4430068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4430067","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4430068","articleId":"4430084","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4430085,"authors":[{"name":"Jinyu Li","affiliation":["Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Jinyu Li","id":"37279856000"},{"name":"Li Deng","affiliation":["Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Li Deng","id":"37271500200"},{"name":"Dong Yu","affiliation":["Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Dong Yu","id":"37419739100"},{"name":"Yifan Gong","affiliation":["Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Yifan Gong","id":"37271888900"},{"name":"Alex Acero","affiliation":["Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Acero","id":"37284200500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1745-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1746-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4430085","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":205},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Taylor series","Hidden Markov models","Nonlinear distortion","Adaptation model","Speech recognition","Working environment noise","Standards development","Parameter estimation","Cepstral analysis","Speech enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distortion","hidden Markov models","linearisation techniques","speech recognition","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-performance HMM adaptation","additive distortion","convolutive distortion","vector Taylor series","model-domain environment-robust adaptation algorithm","Aurora 2 speech recognition task","nonlinear environment distortion model","speech recognizer feedback information","linearization technique","channel parameter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["vector Taylor series","joint compensation","additive and convolutive distortions","robust ASR"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present our recent development of a model-domain environment-robust adaptation algorithm, which demonstrates high performance in the standard Aurora 2 speech recognition task. The algorithm consists of two main steps. First, the noise and channel parameters are estimated using a nonlinear environment distortion model in the cepstral domain, the speech recognizer's \"feedback\" information, and the vector-Taylor-series (VTS) linearization technique collectively. Second, the estimated noise and channel parameters are used to adapt the static and dynamic portions of the HMM means and variances. This two-step algorithm enables joint compensation of both additive and convolutive distortions (JAC). In the experimental evaluation using the standard Aurora 2 task, the proposed JAC/VTS algorithm achieves 91.11% accuracy using the clean-trained simple HMM backend as the baseline system for the model adaptation. This represents high recognition performance on this task without discriminative training of the HMM system. Detailed analysis on the experimental results shows that adaptation of the dynamic portion of the HMM mean and variance parameters is critical to the success of our algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ASRU.2007.4430085","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition & Understanding (ASRU)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Workshop on Automatic

Extended Baum-Welch (EBW) transformations are most commonly used as a discriminative technique for estimating parameters of Gaussian mixtures, though recently they have been used to derive a gradient steepness measurement to evaluate the quality of the model to match the distribution of the data. In this paper, we explore applying the EBW gradient steepness metric in the context of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for recognition of broad phonetic classes and present a detailed analysis and results on the use of this gradient metric on the TIMIT corpus. We find that our gradient metric is able to outperform the baseline likelihood method, and offers improvements in noisy conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ASRU.2007.4430129","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition & Understanding (ASRU)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition & Understanding (ASRU)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4430067/4430068/04430129.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.2007.4430129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4430068","startPage":"306","endPage":"311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broad phonetic class recognition in a Hidden Markov model framework using extended Baum-Welch transformations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4430129","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Broad phonetic class recognition in a Hidden Markov model framework using extended Baum-Welch transformations","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4430129/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9821973","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4430129/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broad phonetic class recognition in a Hidden Markov model framework using extended Baum-Welch transformations","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01092008-00061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061192S","chronDate":"9-13 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4430067","isNumber":"4430068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4430067","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4430068","articleId":"4430129","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4430130,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Yin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, York University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Yan Yin","id":"37577179400"},{"name":"Hui Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, York University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Hui Jiang","id":"37272625700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1745-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1746-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4430130","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Speech recognition","Constraint optimization","Optimization methods","Matrix decomposition","Maximum likelihood estimation","Minimax techniques","Computer science","Acceleration","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","hidden Markov models","learning (artificial intelligence)","mathematical programming","matrix algebra","speech recognition","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semidefinite programming","SDP formulation","large margin estimation","speech recognition","optimization efficiency","smaller-scale SDP problems","SDP-based LME training","independent variable matrices","Gaussian mean vector","feature vector decomposition","Gaussian mixture HMM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic Speech Recognition","Discriminative training","Large Margin Estimation (LME)","Convex Optimization","Semidefinite Programming (SDP)","Convex Relaxation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study a new semidefinite programming (SDP) formulation to improve optimization efficiency for large margin estimation (LME) of HMMs in speech recognition. We re-formulate the same LME problem as smaller-scale SDP problems to speed up the SDP-based LME training, especially for large model sets. In the new formulation, instead of building the SDP problem from a single huge variable matrix, we consider to formulate the SDP problem based on many small independent variable matrices, each of which is built separately from a Gaussian mean vector. Moreover, we propose to further decompose feature vectors and Gaussian mean vectors according to static, delta and accelerate components to build even more compact variable matrices. This method can significantly reduce the total number of free variables and result in much smaller SDP problem even for the same model set. The proposed new LME/SDP methods have been evaluated on a connected digit string recognition task using the TIDIGITS database. Experimental results show that it can significantly improve optimization efficiency (about 30-50 times faster for large model sets) and meanwhile it can provide slightly better optimization accuracy and recognition performance than our previous SDP formulation.","doi":"10.1109/ASRU.2007.4430130","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition & Understanding (ASRU)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition & Understanding (ASRU)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4430067/4430068/04430130.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.2007.4430130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4430068","startPage":"312","endPage":"317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compact semidefinite programming (SDP) formulation for large margin estimation of HMMS in speech recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4430130","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A compact semidefinite programming (SDP) formulation for large margin estimation of HMMS in speech recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4430130/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9821974","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4430130/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compact semidefinite programming (SDP) formulation for large margin estimation of HMMS in speech recognition","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01092008-00062.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08891S","chronDate":"9-13 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4430067","isNumber":"4430068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4430067","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4430068","articleId":"4430130","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4430132,"authors":[{"name":"John R.

The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between two hidden Markov models (HMMs) would be particularly useful in the fields of speech and image recognition. Whereas the KL divergence is tractable for many distributions, including Gaussians, it is not in general tractable for mixture models or HMMs. Recently, variational approximations have been introduced to efficiently compute the KL divergence and Bhattacharyya divergence between two mixture models, by reducing them to the divergences between the mixture components. Here we generalize these techniques to approach the divergence between HMMs using a recursive backward algorithm. Two such methods are introduced, one of which yields an upper bound on the KL divergence, the other of which yields a recursive closed-form solution. The KL and Bhattacharyya divergences, as well as a weighted edit-distance technique, are evaluated for the task of predicting the confusability of pairs of words.","doi":"10.1109/ASRU.2007.4430132","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition & Understanding (ASRU)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition & Understanding (ASRU)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4430067/4430068/04430132.pdf","startPage":"323","endPage":"328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.2007.4430132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4430068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variational Kullback-Leibler divergence for Hidden Markov models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4430132","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4430132/","displayDocTitle":"Variational Kullback-Leibler divergence for Hidden Markov models","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9821976","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4430132/","conferenceDate":"9-13 Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variational Kullback-Leibler divergence for Hidden Markov models","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01092008-00064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063993S","chronDate":"9-13 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4430067","isNumber":"4430068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4430067","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4430068","articleId":"4430132","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4430167,"authors":[{"name":"Jost Schatzmann","affiliation":["Engineering Department, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Jost","lastName":"Schatzmann","id":"37550597700"},{"name":"Blaise Thomson","affiliation":["Engineering Department, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Blaise","lastName":"Thomson","id":"37645892300"},{"name":"Steve Young","affiliation":["Engineering Department, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Young","id":"37265233300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1745-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1746-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4430167","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"abstract":"Human-machine dialogue is heavily influenced by speech recognition and understanding errors and it is hence desirable to train and test statistical dialogue system policies under realistic noise conditions. This paper presents a novel approach to error simulation based on statistical models for word-level utterance generation, ASR confusions, and confidence score generation. While the method explicitly models the context-dependent acoustic confusability of words and allows the system specific language model and semantic decoder to be incorporated, it is computationally inexpensive and thus potentially suitable for running thousands of training simulations. Experimental evaluation results with a POMDP-based dialogue system and the Hidden Agenda User Simulator indicate a close match between the statistical properties of real and synthetic errors.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition & Understanding (ASRU)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4430067/4430068/04430167.pdf","startPage":"526","endPage":"531","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition & Understanding (ASRU)","doi":"10.1109/ASRU.2007.4430167","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.2007.4430167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4430068","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4430167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error simulation for training statistical dialogue systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error analysis","Computational modeling","Context modeling","Management training","Training data","Frequency estimation","Speech recognition","Acoustic noise","Delta modulation","Dictionaries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","human computer interaction","interactive systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","natural languages","speech recognition","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error simulation","statistical dialogue system","human-machine dialogue","speech recognition","word-level utterance generation","confidence score generation","context-dependent acoustic confusability","system specific language model","semantic decoder"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["error simulation","statistical modelling","spoken dialogue systems","POMDP","dialogue policy training"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4430167/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Error simulation for training statistical dialogue systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4430167/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9832818","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","conferenceDate":"9-13 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error simulation for training statistical dialogue systems","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01092008-00099.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087033S","chronDate":"9-13 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4430067","isNumber":"4430068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4430067","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4430068","articleId":"4430167","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4430174,"authors":[{"name":"Sabato Marco Siniscalchi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway"],"firstName":"Sabato Marco","lastName":"Siniscalchi","id":"37267054000"},{"name":"Torbjorn Svendsen","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway"],"firstName":"Torbjorn","lastName":"Svendsen","id":"37378632900"},{"name":"Chin-Hui Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"lastName":"Chin-Hui Lee","id":"37280405600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1745-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1746-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4430174","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Automatic speech recognition","Corporate acquisitions","Hidden Markov models","Event detection","Acoustic signal detection","Error analysis","Speech recognition","Lattices","Telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bottom-up continuous phone recognition","bottom-up ASR systems","automatic speech recognition","articulatory attribute detectors","feed-forward artificial neural networks","evidence verifier","knowledge-rich ASR system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Knowledge based system","Speech recognition","Detectors","Feedforward neural networks"]}],"abstract":"We present a novel approach to designing bottom-up automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. The key component of the proposed approach is a bank of articulatory attribute detectors implemented using a set of feed-forward artificial neural networks (ANNs). Each detector computes a score describing an activation level of the specified speech attributes that the current frame exhibits. These cues are first combined by an event merger that provides some evidence about the presence of a higher level feature which is then verified by an evidence verifier to produce hypotheses at the phone or word level. We evaluate several configurations of our proposed system on a continuous phone recognition task. Experimental results on the TIMIT database show that the system achieves a phone error rate of 25% which is superior to results obtained with either hidden Markov model (HMM) or conditional random field (CRF) based recognizers. We believe the system's inherent flexibility and the ease of adding new detectors may provide further improvements.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards bottom-up continuous phone recognition","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition & Understanding (ASRU)","doi":"10.1109/ASRU.2007.4430174","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition & Understanding (ASRU)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4430067/4430068/04430174.pdf","startPage":"566","endPage":"569","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.2007.4430174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4430068","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4430174","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4430174/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Towards bottom-up continuous phone recognition","conferenceDate":"9-13 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4430174/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9832821","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards bottom-up continuous phone recognition","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01092008-00106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046865S","chronDate":"9-13 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4430067","isNumber":"4430068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4430067","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4430068","articleId":"4430174","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4430218,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

Not only the performance of the imagers was drastically improved, but also their commercial success boomed after the introduction of mobile phones with an onboard camera. Many scientists and marketing specialists predicted 15 years ago that CMOS image sensors were going to completely take over from CCD imagers, in the same way as CCD imagers did mid eighties when they took over the imaging business from tubes [1]. Although CMOS has a strong position in imaging today, it did not rule out the business of CCDs. On the other hand, the CMOS-push drastically increased the overall imaging market due to the fact that CMOS image sensors created new application areas and they boosted the performance of CCD imagers as well.

The A/D converter is designed for an ultra-wideband impulse radio (UWB-IR) receiver that needs to digitize an input signal with a higher frequency than the sampling frequency. With the proposed under-sampling technique, sampling is executed with low-current consumption by separating a sampling capacitor from an operational amplifier and accumulating the offset voltage of the amplifier in another capacitor. In addition, a low-power comparator is proposed, which reduces bias current dynamically corresponding to its input voltage level. The A/D converter is implemented in a 0.18-mum CMOS process technology, which achieves an effective number of bits of 4.9 for input signals with frequencies greater than 1 GHz at 32 M samples/s, and consumes 0.89 mA at a 1.8-V supply.

As we know, nonlinear fast- transient techniques with fixed switching frequency can effectively regulate the unstable output voltage back to steady-state within a short time. However, they suffer from oscillation problem because of large sourcing or sinking recovery current at output of error amplifier by fast transient circuit. Therefore, linear operation provided by AFC technique can dynamically and smoothly adjust the switching frequency, which is proportional to the output voltage variation, to regulate output voltage back to its steady-state value. In other words, AFC technique eliminates system and sub-harmonic oscillation scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate the transient dropout voltage is improved 37.8% when load current changes from 100 mA to 500 mA.","doi":"10.1109/ESSCIRC.2007.4430273","publicationTitle":"ESSCIRC 2007 - 33rd European Solid-State Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"ESSCIRC 2007 - 33rd European Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4430236/4430237/04430273.pdf","startPage":"174","endPage":"177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIRC.2007.4430273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4430237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive frequency control technique for enhancing transient performance of DC-DC converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4430273","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4430273/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive frequency control technique for enhancing transient performance of DC-DC converters","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9835944","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4430273/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive frequency control technique for enhancing transient performance of DC-DC converters","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-01042008-00036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04201S","chronDate":"11-13 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4430236","isNumber":"4430237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4430236","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4430237","articleId":"4430273","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4430278,"authors":[{"name":"S.

By employing 2 PMOS diodes, the LC shows good operation robustness with sub-threshold logic input. The switching delay of the proposed LC can adapt with the input logic voltage which is more suitable for power aware systems. With a simpler circuit structure, the energy consumption of the LC is smaller than that of the existing sub-threshold LC. Simulation results demonstrate the performance improvement and energy reduction of the proposed LC. Test chip was fabricated using 0.18 mum CMOS process. Measurement results show that our proposed LC can operate correctly with an input at as low as 127 mV and an output voltage at 1.8V.","doi":"10.1109/ESSCIRC.2007.4430306","publicationTitle":"ESSCIRC 2007 - 33rd European Solid-State Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"ESSCIRC 2007 - 33rd European Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4430236/4430237/04430306.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIRC.2007.4430306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4430237","startPage":"312","endPage":"315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust, input voltage adaptive and low energy consumption level converter for sub-threshold logic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4430306","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A robust, input voltage adaptive and low energy consumption level converter for sub-threshold logic","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4430306/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9835976","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4430306/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust, input voltage adaptive and low energy consumption level converter for sub-threshold logic","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-01042008-00069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05941S","chronDate":"11-13 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4430236","isNumber":"4430237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4430236","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4430237","articleId":"4430306","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4430308,"authors":[{"name":"Koh Johguchi","affiliation":["Research Center for Nanodevices and Systems, Hiroshima University, Higashihiroshima, Japan"],"lastName":"Koh Johguchi","id":"37281576400"},{"name":"Yuya Mukuda","affiliation":["Research Center for Nanodevices and Systems, Hiroshima University, Higashihiroshima, Japan"],"lastName":"Yuya Mukuda","id":"37828649900"},{"name":"Shinya Izumi","affiliation":["Research Center for Nanodevices and Systems, Hiroshima University, Higashihiroshima, Japan"],"lastName":"Shinya Izumi","id":"37408458200"},{"name":"Hans Jurgen Mattausch","affiliation":["Research Center for Nanodevices and Systems, Hiroshima University, Higashihiroshima, Japan"],"lastName":"Hans Jurgen Mattausch","id":"37269154600"},{"name":"Tetsushi Koide","affiliation":["Research Center for Nanodevices and Systems, Hiroshima University, Higashihiroshima, Japan"],"lastName":"Tetsushi Koide","id":"37269157900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1125-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-8833"}],"articleNumber":"4430308","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":194},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 0.6-Tbps, 16-port SRAM design with 2-stage- pipeline and multi-stage-sensing scheme","displayPublicationTitle":"ESSCIRC 2007 - 33rd European Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4430236/4430237/04430308.pdf","startPage":"320","endPage":"323","publicationTitle":"ESSCIRC 2007 - 33rd European Solid-State Circuits Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIRC.2007.4430308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4430237","doi":"10.1109/ESSCIRC.2007.4430308","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Pipelines","Decoding","CMOS technology","Bandwidth","Power dissipation","Memory architecture","Stability","Frequency","Microprocessors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","integrated circuit design","logic design","multiport networks","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SRAM design","2-stage-pipeline sensing scheme","multistage-sensing scheme","multibank architecture","2-port SRAM cell","CMOS technology","bit rate 0.6 Tbit/s","storage capacity 84 Kbit","word length 32 bit","size 90 nm","frequency 1.2 GHz","power 123 mW"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4430308","abstract":"A 8-read, 8-write port, 64-Kbit, 32-bit word-length SRAM design with multi-bank architecture is reported.

Here, passive materials are of special importance as they maintain their functionality even when scaled down to the nanometer domain. With their regularity and inherent device density so-called nano-scaled crossbars seem to be very interesting for future components beyond the present scope of the ITRS-CMOS roadmap. But, due to their passive behavior they will not be capable of operating on their own without active devices that restore signal levels. This work investigates the limitations resistive hysteretic crossbars face due to their very nature and what performance CMOS read circuits will have to offer to let hybrid circuits result in a functional new technology.","doi":"10.1109/ESSCIRC.2007.4430310","publicationTitle":"ESSCIRC 2007 - 33rd European Solid-State Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"ESSCIRC 2007 - 33rd European Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4430236/4430237/04430310.pdf","startPage":"328","endPage":"331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4430237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIRC.2007.4430310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamental analysis of resistive nano-crossbars for the use in hybrid Nano/CMOS-memory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4430310","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental analysis of resistive nano-crossbars for the use in hybrid Nano/CMOS-memory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4430310/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9835980","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4430310/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Sept. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental analysis of resistive nano-crossbars for the use in hybrid Nano/CMOS-memory","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-01042008-00073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042451S","chronDate":"11-13 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4430236","isNumber":"4430237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4430236","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"4430237","articleId":"4430310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4430311,"authors":[{"name":"Estelle Labonne","affiliation":["TIMA Laboratory, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Estelle","lastName":"Labonne","id":"37681087500"},{"name":"Gilles Sicard","affiliation":["TIMA Laboratory, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Gilles","lastName":"Sicard","id":"37295710300"},{"name":"Marc Renaudin","affiliation":["TIMA Laboratory, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Renaudin","id":"37282559600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1125-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-8833"}],"articleNumber":"4430311","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":315},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dynamic range","Calibration","Photoconductivity","CMOS technology","Semiconductor device measurement","CMOS image sensors","Noise reduction","Diodes","Sampling methods","Threshold voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","CMOS image sensors","compensation","integrated circuit testing","photoemission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensor","fixed pattern noise reduction","high dynamic range","logarithmic architecture pixel","diode photocurrent","calibration source","compensation","lower power consumption","integrated circuit testing","size 0.35 mum","voltage 3.3 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["high dynamic range CMOS image sensor","FPN reduction"]}],"abstract":"A high dynamic range CMOS image sensor implementing a fixed pattern noise (FPN) reduction method is presented. The high dynamic range is reach through a logarithmic architecture pixel. An on-chip calibration method is implemented to reduce the FPN caused by process variations, weakness of this architecture. The basic principle is the calibration of each pixel against an in-pixel reference current in place of the diode photocurrent. Two pixel levels corresponding to the photocurrent and a known reference current become available for every pixel Then a double sampling technique allows removing offsets due to threshold voltage variations. An innovation of this work consists in the implementation of the current calibration source totally inside the pixel, allowing a better precision of the FPN compensation and lower power consumption. This FPN reduction method is performed while keeping only four transistors per pixel. A 128times128 pixels test chip has been designed and fabricated in 0.35 mum, 3.3 V CMOS standard technology.

Techniques for efficient behavior of both the amplitude (AM) and phase (PM) path are introduced. The envelope linearization technique is based on asynchronous pulse-width modulation of a phase-modulated RF signal. The efficiency of the switching amplifier is less dependent of the output power, compared to class B operation. Using a self-oscillating, asynchronous type of pulse-width modulator, the spurs are concentrated in narrow bands well separated from the signal band. These switching spurs are filtered out by the filters already present in the transmitter. The feasibility of this RF-pulse-width-modulation is proven by measurements with UMTS-signals on a prototype in 0.18 mum CMOS, yielding a peak output power of 8.26 dBm and a drain efficiency of 35%. In the phase-modulation path of the polar transmitter, injection locking of an oscillator is used as a single-stage high- gain amplifier. Avoiding multiple stages and related power loss improves the overall power efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/ESSCIRC.2007.4430323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIRC.2007.4430323","startPage":"380","endPage":"383","displayPublicationTitle":"ESSCIRC 2007 - 33rd European Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4430236/4430237/04430323.pdf","publicationTitle":"ESSCIRC 2007 - 33rd European Solid-State Circuits Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4430237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A power amplifier driver using self-oscillating pulse-width modulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A power amplifier driver using self-oscillating pulse-width modulators","conferenceDate":"11-13 Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4430323/","accessionNumber":"9835993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4430323/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A power amplifier driver using self-oscillating pulse-width modulators","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-01042008-00086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032077S","chronDate":"11-13 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4430236","isNumber":"4430237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4430236","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4430237","articleId":"4430323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4430324,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Static memories are dominating factors in the cost, the performance and the energy consumption of such systems. Deep deep submicron scaling beyond 130 nm complicates the design of SRAM circuits that make a good compromise between performance and energy consumption. This is mainly caused by leakage and technological variability. The effect of leakage and variability is amplified by the fact that large area penalties are unacceptable for cost reasons. As a consequence, novel circuit designs are needed to alleviate the additional problems introduced by advanced scaling while keeping classic scaling advantages intact. This paper gives an overview of circuit techniques that have recently been proposed to improve the position of SRAMS in the area-energy-performance design space. This paper starts from the SRAM cell, expands to the local bitline to conclude with the circuit architecture of complete SRAMs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4430324/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Sept. 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4430324/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9835994","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Embedded SRAM design in deep deep submicron technologies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embedded SRAM design in deep deep submicron technologies","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-01042008-00087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060993S","chronDate":"11-13 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4430236","isNumber":"4430237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4430236","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4430237","articleId":"4430324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4430325,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The data retention voltage (DRV) defines the minimum supply voltage for a cell to hold its state. Within-die variation causes a statistical distribution of DRV for individual cells in a memory array, and cells far out the tail (i.e. >6sigma) limit the array DRV for large memories. We present two statistical methods to estimate the tail of the DRV distribution. First, we develop a new statistical model based on the connection between DRV and static noise margin (SNM). Second, we apply our Statistical Blockade tool to obtain fast Monte-Carlo simulation and a generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) model for comparison. Both the new model and the GPD model offer a high accuracy (<2% error) and a huge speed-up (>10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sup>\ntimes for 1 G-b memory) over Monte-Carlo simulation.

This study uses data on web applications from the Tukutuku database.","doi":"10.1109/IIT.2007.4430367","startPage":"576","endPage":"580","publicationTitle":"2007 Innovations in Information Technologies (IIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IIT.2007.4430367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4430362","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Innovations in Information Technologies (IIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4430361/4430362/04430367.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy Radial Basis Function Neural Networks for Web Applications Cost Estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4430367/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy Radial Basis Function Neural Networks for Web Applications Cost Estimation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4430367/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9835771","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","conferenceDate":"18-20 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Nov. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy Radial Basis Function Neural Networks for Web Applications Cost Estimation","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"IIT-00-5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041094S","chronDate":"18-20 Nov. 2007","isNumber":"4430362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4430361","citationCount":"3","articleId":"4430367","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4430368,"authors":[{"name":"Tae-Hwan Kim","affiliation":["School ofInformation and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Tae-Hwan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37656828600"},{"name":"Tae-Jin Lee","affiliation":["School ofInformation and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Tae-Jin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37277273500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1840-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1841-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4430368","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":124},"abstract":"In cognitive radio (CR) networks, a secondary CR network borrows spectrum bands from primary networks for the purpose of improving spectrum efficiency.

The results show that the effects of frequency offset become crucial as system loading increases. The precise error-rate analysis is extended to a system using multichannel reception with maximal ratio combining (MRC). It is demonstrated, through both analysis and numerical evaluation, that the error-rate performance over a frequency selective channel deteriorates by increasing frequency offset. In addition, it is clear from the results that using multichannel reception enhances system performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Performance of A Diversity-based MC-CDMA in the Presence of Frequency Offset and Inter-Carrier Interferences","publicationTitle":"2007 Innovations in Information Technologies (IIT)","doi":"10.1109/IIT.2007.4430417","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Innovations in Information Technologies (IIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4430361/4430362/04430417.pdf","startPage":"272","endPage":"276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IIT.2007.4430417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4430362","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4430417","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4430417/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"The Performance of A Diversity-based MC-CDMA in the Presence of Frequency Offset and Inter-Carrier Interferences","conferenceDate":"18-20 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4430417/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9835821","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Performance of A Diversity-based MC-CDMA in the Presence of Frequency Offset and Inter-Carrier Interferences","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"IIT-00-55.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060561S","chronDate":"18-20 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4430361","isNumber":"4430362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4430361","xplore-issue":"4430362","articleId":"4430417","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4430431,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Reza Feizi Derakhshi","affiliation":["Computer Science faculty, University of Tabriz, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Reza Feizi","lastName":"Derakhshi","id":"37828654700"},{"name":"Mohammad Reza Kangavari","affiliation":["Computer engineering department, University of science and Technology of Iran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Reza","lastName":"Kangavari","id":"37689799100"},{"name":"Elnaz Zafarani Moattar","affiliation":["Islamic Azad University, Science and Research, Iran"],"firstName":"Elnaz Zafarani","lastName":"Moattar","id":"37828654100"},{"name":"Mahdi Aliyari Shorehdeli","affiliation":["K.N.Toosi University of Technology, Iran"],"firstName":"Mahdi Aliyari","lastName":"Shorehdeli","id":"37828643200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1840-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1841-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4430431","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Decoding","Databases","Speech processing","Speech recognition","Vocabulary","Computer science","Computer networks","Infrared detectors","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural nets","recurrent neural nets","word processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["word boundary detection","phoneme sequence","recurrent fuzzy neural networks","postorder model","preorder model","learning algorithm","relevant structure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Word boundary detection","Recurrent fuzzy neural network","Fuzzy neural network","Fuzzy logic","Natural language processing","Speech processing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4430431","abstract":"The word boundary detection has an application in speech processing systems.

The proposed scheme mixes between soft-decision and hard-decision algorithms and provides a good tradeoff between error performance and decoding delay as proved by simulation results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Stage Hybrid decoding for Low-Density Parity-Check codes","publicationTitle":"2007 Innovations in Information Technologies (IIT)","doi":"10.1109/IIT.2007.4430491","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Innovations in Information Technologies (IIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4430361/4430362/04430491.pdf","startPage":"650","endPage":"654","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IIT.2007.4430491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4430362","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4430491","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4430491/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Two-Stage Hybrid decoding for Low-Density Parity-Check codes","conferenceDate":"18-20 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4430491/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9835895","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Stage Hybrid decoding for Low-Density Parity-Check codes","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"IIT-00-129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046601S","chronDate":"18-20 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4430361","isNumber":"4430362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4430361","xplore-issue":"4430362","articleId":"4430491","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4430497,"authors":[{"name":"V.L Lajish","affiliation":["TCS Innovation Lab, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., Mumbai"],"firstName":"V.L","lastName":"Lajish","id":"37085482136"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1840-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1841-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4430497","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4430497","abstract":"This paper present a novel feature extraction method for offline recognition of segmented handwritten characters based on the fuzzy-zoning and normalized vector distance measures.

While some of the existing BFV and BE techniques do have \"proven\" security properties, those proofs make assumptions that may not, in general, be valid for biometric systems. We briefly review some of the other known attacks against BFV and BE techniques.

There are many real networks that follow this model, for example, wildlife tracking sensor networks, military networks, vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), etc. In this context, conventional routing schemes would fail, because they try to establish complete end-to-end paths, before any data is sent. To deal with such networks researchers have suggested to use flooding-based routing schemes. While flooding-based schemes have a high probability of delivery, they waste a lot of energy and suffer from severe contention which can significantly degrade their performance. With this in mind, we look into a number of ldquosingle-copyrdquo routing schemes that use only one copy per message, and hence significantly reduce the resource requirements of flooding-based algorithms. We perform a detailed exploration of the single-copy routing space in order to identify efficient single-copy solutions that (i) can be employed when low resource usage is critical, and (ii) can help improve the design of general routing schemes that use multiple copies. We also propose a theoretical framework that we use to analyze the performance of all single-copy schemes presented, and to derive upper and lower bounds on the delay of any scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Routing in Intermittently Connected Mobile Networks: The Single-Copy Case","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2007.897962","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/4453941/04430783.pdf","startPage":"63","endPage":"76","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2007.897962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4453941","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4430783","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4430783/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Routing in Intermittently Connected Mobile Networks: The Single-Copy Case","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4430783/","dateOfInsertion":"15 February 2008","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9794449","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Routing in Intermittently Connected Mobile Networks: The Single-Copy Case","sourcePdf":"16tnet01-spyropoulos.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117243S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"4453941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"416","xplore-issue":"4453941","articleId":"4430783","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4430786,"authors":[{"name":"Giuseppe Ferri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of L'' Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Giuseppe Ferri (M'95\u2013A'95\u2013M'97\u2013SM'06) received the Laurea degree in electronic engineering from the University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy, in 1988.","Since 1991, he has been a Researcher, and since 2001, he has been an Associate Professor of electronics with the Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of L'Aquila.

The oscillation amplitude of a metallic beam, which is near some resonant frequencies, can be reduced by converting mechanical energy into electrical energy through a piezoelectric transducer that is bonded to the beam. An electric circuit, which is made up of the piezoelectric transducer, a resistance, and an inductance, accomplishes the task of dissipating the energy. To this end, the natural frequency of the circuit should be close to the natural frequency of interest of the mechanical system. The high value that is requested for the inductance (thousands of Henrys) can only be achieved through an inductance-simulator circuit. In the literature, the circuit implementations of the inductance simulators are typically based on operational amplifiers, such as the Antoniou circuit. In this paper, we make use of the CCIIs, which allow us to obtain both grounded and floating equivalent inductances that work within a regulated frequency range from three to four decades. The effectiveness of the traditional inductance simulators and CCII-based simulators is discussed, comparing the responses of an experimental mechanical-electrical system, with different circuit implementations, through experimental results. The use of series-resistance compensation, which is obtained through the use of a suitable topology based on the CCIIs, in the implementation of the equivalent inductance, allows one to obtain the best vibration damping, as confirmed by measurements, for all the natural mechanical frequencies of the realized system.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4479660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2007.913762","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/4479660/04430786.pdf","startPage":"907","endPage":"914","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2007.913762","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vibration Damping Using CCII-Based Inductance Simulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","displayDocTitle":"Vibration Damping Using CCII-Based Inductance Simulators","volume":"57","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4430786/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9920620","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4430786/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vibration Damping Using CCII-Based Inductance Simulators","sourcePdf":"57tim05-ferri.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061169S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"4479660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4479660","articleId":"4430786","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4430792,"authors":[{"name":"Jangheon Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jangheon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37281187400"},{"name":"Young Yun Woo","affiliation":["Telecommunication Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young Yun","lastName":"Woo","id":"37274746900"},{"name":"Junghwan Moon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Junghwan","lastName":"Moon","id":"37290421700"},{"name":"Bumman Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bumman","lastName":"Kim","id":"37276226900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9480"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9670"}],"articleNumber":"4430792","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1210},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4430792","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","Predistortion","Feedback","Digital modulation","Bandwidth","Broadband amplifiers","Power amplifiers","Polynomials","Multiaccess communication","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","distortion","feedback amplifiers","linearisation techniques","modulation","MOSFET","polynomials","radiocommunication","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband digital feedback predistortion technique","digital feedback predistortion linearization technique","memory-effect compensation technique","class-AB amplifier","LDMOSFET","memory polynomial technique","forward-link WCDMA 2FA signal","carrier spacing","conventional DFBPD","computational complexity","power amplifier","wideband code division multiple access","frequency 2.14 GHz","power 90 W"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Memory effects","power amplifier (PA)","predistortion (PD)","wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2007.914362","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4446042/04430792.pdf","startPage":"385","endPage":"392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2007.914362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4446042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Wideband Adaptive Digital Predistortion Technique Employing Feedback Linearization","abstract":"We develop a new wideband digital feedback predistortion (WDFBPD) technique for modulated signals with wide bandwidths by combining digital feedback predistortion (DFBPD) linearization and memory-effect compensation techniques.

temperature-dependence, and saturation of the observed threshold voltage shift have been extensively studied. As soon as the stress is removed, however, relaxation sets in, restoring at least some of the degradation. Although some studies on the relaxation phase have been presented, few authors have acknowledged the importance of the relaxation phase as a means of deepening our understanding of NBTI. We present a detailed analysis of NBTI relaxation, show that even at lower stressing voltages a permanent/slowly relaxing component is present, and demonstrate how this initially less dominant component might eventually determine the device lifetime.","doi":"10.1109/ESSDERC.2007.4430895","displayPublicationTitle":"ESSDERC 2007 - 37th European Solid State Device Research Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4430869/4430870/04430895.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4430870","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSDERC.2007.4430895","publicationTitle":"ESSDERC 2007 - 37th European Solid State Device Research Conference","startPage":"127","endPage":"130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Negative bias temperature instability: Recoverable versus permanent degradation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4430895","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Negative bias temperature instability: Recoverable versus permanent degradation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4430895/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4430895/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9808431","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","conferenceDate":"11-13 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Negative bias temperature instability: Recoverable versus permanent degradation","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-01092008-00025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035207S","chronDate":"11-13 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4430869","isNumber":"4430870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4430869","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4430870","articleId":"4430895","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4430899,"authors":[{"name":"N.

To sustain the development of new and scaled PCM technologies, a comprehensive understanding and modelling of the cell at the material, cell and large-array levels are required. This paper will address the most significant achievements in the electrothermal modelling of PCM single cell. After reviewing the transport modeling in the amorphous and crystalline phases of the chalcogenide material, we focus on the application modeling of the cell, discussing programming current minimization by geometry optimization, trade-off between programming current and readout resistance and the program disturb issue. Scaling of the PCM is extensively addressed, comparing isotropic and non isotropic scaling and the respective impact on cell reliability. The open issues for PCM physical modeling are finally pointed out.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4430870","publicationTitle":"ESSDERC 2007 - 37th European Solid State Device Research Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"ESSDERC 2007 - 37th European Solid State Device Research Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4430869/4430870/04430917.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ESSDERC.2007.4430917","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSDERC.2007.4430917","startPage":"214","endPage":"221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Status and challenges of PCM modeling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4430917/","displayDocTitle":"Status and challenges of PCM modeling","htmlLink":"/document/4430917/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9808441","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Status and challenges of PCM modeling","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-01092008-00047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067761S","chronDate":"11-13 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4430869","isNumber":"4430870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4430869","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4430870","articleId":"4430917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4430918,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The large set of data measured on arrays clearly demonstrates the robustness of our process and integration scheme. Different Si-NC deposition conditions are explored and the array voltage distribution widths are related to Si-NC size/dispersion. Main reliability characteristics, as endurance and data-retention after cycling, are studied. Results obtained on large arrays are correlated to single cell characteristics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4430965/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9832683","htmlLink":"/document/4430965/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Integration of CVD silicon nanocrystals in a 32Mb NOR flash memory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integration of CVD silicon nanocrystals in a 32Mb NOR flash memory","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-01092008-00095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040115S","chronDate":"11-13 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4430869","isNumber":"4430870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4430869","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4430870","articleId":"4430965","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4431170,"authors":[{"name":"Jung-Ho Chung","affiliation":["Research Laboratory of Electronics and Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Jung-Ho Chung","id":"37694130200"},{"name":"Yu Gu","affiliation":["Research Laboratory of Electronics and Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Yu Gu","id":"37533111800"},{"name":"James G.

In over one-third of these cases, the cause is never found. Despite standard invasive examination techniques, much of the GI tract's inner workings remain a mystery. Procedures exist for examining the esophagus and stomach (gastroscopy) and the colon (colonoscopy), delivering some information at a cost of much distress to the patient. However, the small intestine remains inaccessible. Swallowable capsules have been evolving for almost half a century and are now helping uncover GI tract mysteries in diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

Implantable medical devices monitor and treat physiological conditions within the body. These devices - including pacemakers, implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs), drug delivery systems, and neurostimulators - can help manage a broad range of ailments, such as cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes, and Parkinson's disease. IMDs' pervasiveness continues to swell, with upward of 25 million US citizens currently reliant on them for life-critical functions. Growth is spurred by geriatric care of the aging baby-boomer generation, and new therapies continually emerge for chronic conditions ranging from pediatric type 1 diabetes to anorgasmia and other sexual dysfunctions. Moreover, the latest IMDs support delivery of telemetry for remote monitoring over long-range, high-bandwidth wireless links, and emerging devices will communicate with other interoperating IMDs.","doi":"10.1109/MPRV.2008.16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MPRV.2008.16","startPage":"30","endPage":"39","publicationTitle":"IEEE Pervasive Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Pervasive Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7756/4431843/04431854.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4431843","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security and Privacy for Implantable Medical Devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4431854/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","displayDocTitle":"Security and Privacy for Implantable Medical Devices","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9919885","publicationDate":"Jan.-March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4431854/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security and Privacy for Implantable Medical Devices","sourcePdf":"mpc2008010030.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078267S","chronDate":"Jan.-March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7756","isNumber":"4431843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7756","citationCount":"256","xplore-issue":"4431843","articleId":"4431854","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":4431857,"authors":[{"name":"Shyamal Patel","affiliation":["Northeastern University, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Shyamal Patel is a research engineer in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School's Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital and a doctoral candidate at Northeastern University.

Design rules, operating voltages, frequencies, and temperatures are precisely chosen to ensure correct product functional operation over its intended lifetime. Thus, in order to obtain the overall performance and functionality bounded by various design and manufacturing constraints, the integrated circuit reliability must be modeled and analyzed at the very beginning of design stages. This paper reviews some of the most important intrinsic wearout mechanisms of MOSFETs (including hot-carrier injection, time-dependent dielectric breakdown, and negative bias temperature instability) and introduces new accelerated-lifetime and SPICE compact models of these wearout mechanisms. Based on these circuit-aging models, a new SPICE reliability simulation approach is proposed and demonstrated with a simplified SRAM design on a commercial 90-nm technology to help designers understand device-failure behaviors, predict circuit reliability, and improve product robustness.","doi":"10.1109/TDMR.2008.915629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4463806","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDMR.2008.915629","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/7298/4463806/04431867.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact Modeling of MOSFET Wearout Mechanisms for Circuit-Reliability Simulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Compact Modeling of MOSFET Wearout Mechanisms for Circuit-Reliability Simulation","volume":"8","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4431867/","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9918694","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4431867/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact Modeling of MOSFET Wearout Mechanisms for Circuit-Reliability Simulation","sourcePdf":"08tdmr01-li2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.184417S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"4463806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"4463806","articleId":"4431867","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4431875,"authors":[{"name":"Haimin Tao","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Eindhovan University of Technology, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4463842/4431875/4431875-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haimin Tao was born in China in 1976.

The topology comprises a high-frequency three-winding transformer and three half-bridges, one of which is a boost half-bridge interfacing a power port with a wide operating voltage. The three half-bridges are coupled by the transformer, thereby providing galvanic isolation for all the power ports. The converter is controlled by phase shift, which achieves the primary power flow control, in combination with pulsewidth modulation (PWM). Because of the particular structure of the boost half-bridge, voltage variations at the port can be compensated for by operating the boost half-bridge, together with the other two half-bridges, at an appropriate duty cycle to keep a constant voltage across the half-bridge. The resulting waveforms applied to the transformer windings are asymmetrical due to the automatic volt-seconds balancing of the half-bridges. With the PWM control it is possible to reduce the rms loss and to extend the zero-voltage switching operating range to the entire phase shift region. A fuel cell and supercapacitor generation system is presented as an embodiment of the proposed multiport topology. The theoretical considerations are verified by simulation and with experimental results from a 1 kW prototype.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power

major source of disturbances for common stage systems. For the purpose of high precision contouring performance, both contouring control and friction compensation are necessary. Hence, this brief studies the contouring controller design problem of a biaxial stage system subject to friction. Moreover, to cope with the real situation happening in most stage systems, position is assumed to be the only available information for design. By incorporating a friction model into system dynamics and with the help of the task coordinate formulation, an observer-based contouring controller is proposed to solve this problem. Based on the results of state observation, friction forces can be well estimated and compensated. The resulted contouring controller possesses an integrated structure such that the feedforward, feedback, contouring, and friction compensation controls can be synthesized in a systematic manner. Simulation and experimental results are consistent to the theoretical analyses and verify the proposed scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4431878/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2008","accessionNumber":"9799993","htmlLink":"/document/4431878/","displayDocTitle":"Observer-Based Contouring Controller Design of a Biaxial Stage System Subject to Friction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Observer-Based Contouring Controller Design of a Biaxial Stage System Subject to Friction","sourcePdf":"16tcst02-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078377S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"4456726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4456726","articleId":"4431878","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4431881,"authors":[{"name":"Seul Jung","affiliation":["Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seul","lastName":"Jung","id":"37278071900"},{"name":"Sung Su Kim","affiliation":["Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea","Agency for Defence Development, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung Su","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279289800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6536"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0865"},{"format":"CD","value":"2374-0159"}],"articleNumber":"4431881","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":141,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2934},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Intelligent control","Signal processing algorithms","Control systems","Pi control","Proportional control","System testing","Costs","Digital signal processing","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multivariable control systems","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","pendulums","position control","signal processing","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control experiment","wheel-driven mobile inverted pendulum neural network","intelligent control","neural network learning algorithm","digital signal processing","proportional-integral-differential controller","system dynamics uncertainty","gyro sensor","phase lag compensation","pendulum balancing","cart trajectory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile pendulum","neural network control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4431881","abstract":"The mobile inverted pendulum is developed and tested for an intelligent control experiment of control engineers.

With a much lower complexity than the optimal allocation, these algorithms achieve an excellent tradeoff between throughput and proportional fairness, even with the increased signaling overhead.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.060443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.060443","startPage":"22","endPage":"26","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4432233/04432238.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proportional fairness in multi-carrier system with multi-slot frames: upper bound and user multiplexing algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Proportional fairness in multi-carrier system with multi-slot frames: upper bound and user multiplexing algorithms","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4432238/","accessionNumber":"9775741","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4432238/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proportional fairness in multi-carrier system with multi-slot frames: upper bound and user multiplexing algorithms","sourcePdf":"tw-0801-022.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056481S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4432233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4432233","articleId":"4432238","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":4432239,"authors":[{"name":"Changho Suh","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Changho","lastName":"Suh","id":"37275088800"},{"name":"Jeonghoon Mo","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jeonghoon","lastName":"Mo","id":"37290863700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"4432239","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":122,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1280},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Wireless communication","Decoding","Streaming media","OFDM","Downlink","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Fading","Bit rate","Multicast algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","multicast communication","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","multicast services","multicarrier wireless communications","optimal subcarrier","bit allocation method","two step suboptimum algorithm","bit loading","heuristic solutions"]}],"abstract":"We consider a multicast resource allocation problem for the downlink in OFDM-based wireless cellular network systems. In a conventional multicast system, to accommodate users with bad channel conditions, the transmission is based on the worst case user. We show that such a multicast system saturates the capacity when the number of users increases in fading environments. We exploit the multicarrier nature of OFDM and advances in coding techniques such as MDC (multiple description coding), in which arbitrary combinations of layers can be decoded at the receiver. Different MDC layers are carried over different subcarriers and users with good channels receive data from more subcarriers than users with poor channel conditions. We present an optimal subcarrier/bit allocation method requiring full search of possible candidates. To reduce the complexity, we propose a two-step suboptimum algorithm by separating subcarrier allocation and bit loading. Numerical results show that the proposed heuristics significantly outperform the conventional multicast transmission scheme.

We show that contrary to what is often assumed in the literature, the multiuser interference in such systems is fundamentally asynchronous. Intuitively, perfect timing-advance mechanisms can at best only ensure that the desired signal components -but not also the interference components -are perfectly aligned at their intended mobile stations. We develop an accurate mathematical model for the asynchronicity, and show that it leads to a significant performance degradation of existing designs that ignore the asynchronicity of interference. Using three previously proposed linear preceding design methods for BS cooperation, we develop corresponding algorithms that are better at mitigating the impact of the asynchronicity of the interference. Furthermore, we also address timing-advance inaccuracies (jitter), which are inevitable in a practical system. We show that using jitter-statistics-aware precoders can mitigate the impact of these inaccuracies as well. The insights of this paper are critical for the practical implementation of BS cooperation in multiuser MIMO systems, a topic that is typically oversimplified in the literature.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous interference mitigation in cooperative base station systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.060193","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4432233/04432257.pdf","startPage":"155","endPage":"165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.060193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432233","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4432257","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4432257/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous interference mitigation in cooperative base station systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4432257/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9775757","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous interference mitigation in cooperative base station systems","sourcePdf":"tw-0801-155.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092642S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4432233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"4432233","articleId":"4432257","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4432258,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Li","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, Zhejiang University of Science and Technology, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4432233/4432258/4432258-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jing Li received her B.Sc. degree in information engineering from Zhejiang University, China, in 2003.

In case of a channel which is quasi-static over adjacent OFDM symbol durations, we propose a Space-Time-Frequency code that benefits from a reduced maximum likelihood decoding complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.060420","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.060420","startPage":"184","endPage":"192","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4432233/04432260.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quasi-Orthogonal Space-Frequency and Space-Time-Frequency Block Codes for MIMO OFDM Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4432260/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","displayDocTitle":"Quasi-Orthogonal Space-Frequency and Space-Time-Frequency Block Codes for MIMO OFDM Channels","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9775760","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4432260/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quasi-Orthogonal Space-Frequency and Space-Time-Frequency Block Codes for MIMO OFDM Channels","sourcePdf":"tw-0801-184.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067271S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4432233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4432233","articleId":"4432260","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4432265,"authors":[{"name":"Jingxian Wu","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, Sonoma State University, Rohnert Park, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4432233/4432265/4432265-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jingxian Wu (S'02-M'06) received the B.S.

The trellis-based maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) algorithm serves as the optimum SISO equalizer for turbo equalization. However, MAP algorithm is unsuitable for systems with large modulation constellation size and severe inter-symbol interference (ISI) due to its prohibitively high computational complexity. In this paper, an improved SISO block decision feedback equalizer (BDFE) is proposed for low complexity turbo equalization. Unlike other sub-optimum equalizers which perform symbol by symbol detection, the proposed equalizer generates the soft output for each data bit by collecting information from a sequence of samples as in MAP algorithm. The sequence-based equalization is enabled by using not only soft a priori input from channel decoder, but also hard a priori information obtained from BDFE in previous iteration. The combination of soft a priori information and hard a priori information renders better performance with less iterations compared to other sub-optimum algorithms. In addition, the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is on the same order as conventional SISO BDFE algorithm, and is much lower compared to the trellis-based MAP algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4432265/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4432265/","accessionNumber":"9901444","displayDocTitle":"Improved BDFE Using A Priori Information for Turbo Equalization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved BDFE Using A Priori Information for Turbo Equalization","sourcePdf":"tw-0801-233.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068555S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4432233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4432233","articleId":"4432265","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4432266,"authors":[{"name":"Emre Aktas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Hacettepe University, Beytepe Ankara, Turkey","ARC Special Research Centre for Ultra-Broadband Information Networks (CUBIN), Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4432233/4432266/4432266-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Emre Aktas (S'96-M'03) received the B.S. degree from Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, in 1996 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from The Ohio State University, Columbus, in 1998 and 2002, respectively.

Distributed multiuser detection algorithms with local message passing among neighbor base stations are proposed and compared in terms of computational complexity required in the base stations, the amount of serial communications among them, error rate performance, and convergence speed. The algorithms based on the belief propagation algorithm result in complexity and delay per base station which do not grow as the network size increases. In addition, it is observed that these algorithms have near single-user error rate performance for the fading channels considered. Thus it is illustrated that using the belief propagation algorithm, it is possible to have full frequency re-use and achieve near-optimal performance with moderate computational complexity and a limited amount of message passing between base stations of adjacent cells.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.060469","startPage":"241","endPage":"250","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4432233/04432266.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.060469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Decoding in a Cellular Multiple-Access Channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Base stations","Message passing","Computational complexity","Error analysis","Belief propagation","Cellular networks","Multiuser detection","Convergence","Propagation delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","computational complexity","fading channels","message passing","multi-access systems","multiuser channels","multiuser detection","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed decoding","cellular multiple-access channel","base-station cooperation","multiuser detection algorithms","local message passing","computational complexity","serial communications","belief propagation algorithm","single-user error rate performance","fading channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4432266/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Decoding in a Cellular Multiple-Access Channel","volume":"7","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4432266/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9775763","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Decoding in a Cellular Multiple-Access Channel","sourcePdf":"tw-0801-241.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075235S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4432233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"4432233","articleId":"4432266","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4432270,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-wen Chang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4432233/4432270/4432270-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiao-Wen Chang received the B.S. and M.S. de- grees in computational mathematics from Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, in 1986 and 1989, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree (Dean's Honor List) in computer science from McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in 1997.","He is currently an Associate Professor of Computer Science at McGill University.

However, we expose here the following remarkable result for a large network with a standard power control policy. The capacity maximizing joint multicell scheduling problem admits a simple and fully distributed solution. This result is proved analytically for an idealized network. From the constructive proof, we propose a practical algorithm that is shown to achieve near maximum capacity for realistic cases of simulated networks of even small sizes.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.060503","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4432233/04432271.pdf","startPage":"288","endPage":"297","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.060503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal and Distributed Scheduling for Multicell Capacity Maximization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4432271","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4432271/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal and Distributed Scheduling for Multicell Capacity Maximization","volume":"7","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9775765","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4432271/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal and Distributed Scheduling for Multicell Capacity Maximization","sourcePdf":"tw-0801-288.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063494S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4432233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"4432233","articleId":"4432271","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4432273,"authors":[{"name":"Atef Abdrabou","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4432233/4432273/4432273-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Atef Abdrabou received the B.

We show that the number of packets successfully transmitted by any node over a time interval follows a general distribution, which is close to a Poisson distribution with an upper bounded distribution distance. The bound on the distribution distance is almost constant and is mainly affected by some system parameters and very slightly by the number of active nodes in the network. We also show that the service time distribution can be approximated by a geometric distribution. We illustrate that the usage of discrete-time queuing analysis (M/Geo/1) near network saturation greatly simplifies the queuing analysis and leads to sufficiently accurate results for both the first order statistics and the probability distribution of the number of packets in the queuing system. Computer simulation results demonstrate that the M/Geo/1 queuing model is very accurate.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ad hoc networks","Queueing analysis","Delay effects","Resource management","Statistical analysis","Statistical distributions","Call admission control","Performance analysis","Wireless communication","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","discrete time systems","Poisson distribution","queueing theory","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["service time approximation","IEEE 802.11 single-hop ad hoc network","Poisson distribution","discrete-time queuing analysis","probability distribution","queuing system","M/Geo/1 queuing model"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.060530","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4432233/04432273.pdf","startPage":"305","endPage":"313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.060530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Service Time Approximation in IEEE 802.11 Single-Hop Ad Hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4432273","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Service Time Approximation in IEEE 802.11 Single-Hop Ad Hoc Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4432273/","volume":"7","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4432273/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9901448","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Service Time Approximation in IEEE 802.11 Single-Hop Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"tw-0801-305.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105634S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4432233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4432233","articleId":"4432273","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-02"},{"_id":4432274,"authors":[{"name":"Shuang Tan","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4432233/4432274/4432274-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shuang Tan received the B.E. degree and the M.E. degree in the electronic information engineering from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, China, in 1999 and 2002, respectively.

This paper proposes a novel distributed RRS algorithm based on analytic multi-objective optimization. The proposed algorithm relaxes the constraints and jointly optimizes all the required objectives. Infinity set of optimal solutions, called Pareto optimal, is obtained. Each solution in the set is optimal in a specific sense. The decision maker selects the required solution that fulfills the network requirements and conditions. Some of the conventional RRS algorithms are special cases of our multi-objective based algorithm. Detailed mathematical analysis of the proposed algorithm is given. Simulation results show the behavior of the proposed algorithm as well as its advantages over conventional algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.060533","startPage":"343","endPage":"353","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.060533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432233","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4432233/04432277.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applications of Multi-Objective Optimization Techniques in Radio Resource Scheduling of Cellular Communication Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4432277/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Applications of Multi-Objective Optimization Techniques in Radio Resource Scheduling of Cellular Communication Systems","volume":"7","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4432277/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9901450","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications of Multi-Objective Optimization Techniques in Radio Resource Scheduling of Cellular Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"tw-0801-343.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118395S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4432233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4432233","articleId":"4432277","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4432287,"authors":[{"name":"Kyung-Young Jung","affiliation":["ElectroScience Laboratory and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Kyung-Young","lastName":"Jung","id":"37286659200"},{"name":"F.

Power and data are transmitted to the implant wirelessly through a bidirectional inductive link, allowing diagnosis of the stimulating device and its environment after implantation, as well as power delivery optimization. A high level of flexibility is supported in terms of stimulation parameters, but a configurable communication protocol allows the device to be used with maximum efficiency. The core of an external controller implemented in a system on a programmable chip is also presented, performing data conversion and timing management such that phosphene intensity can be modulated by any parameter defining stimulation, either at the pulse level or in the time domain. Measured performances achieved with a prototype using two types of custom ASICs implemented in a 0.18-mum CMOS process and commercial components fulfill the requirements for a complete visual prosthesis for humans.

These structures can be of two types: ldquostep-downrdquo and ldquostep-up.rdquo These blocks are inserted in classical converters: buck, boost, buck-boost, Cuk, Zeta, Sepic. The ldquostep-downrdquo C- or L-switching structures can be combined with the buck, buck-boost, Cuk, Zeta, Sepic converters in order to get a step-down function. When the active switch of the converter is on, the inductors in the L-switching blocks are charged in series or the capacitors in the C-switching blocks are discharged in parallel. When the active switch is off, the inductors in the L-switching blocks are discharged in parallel or the capacitors in the C-switching blocks are charged in series. The ldquostep-uprdquo C- or L-switching structures are combined with the boost, buck-boost, Cuk, Zeta, Sepic converters, to get a step-up function. The steady-state analysis of the new hybrid converters allows for determing their DC line-to-output voltage ratio. The gain formula shows that the hybrid converters are able to reduce/increase the line voltage more times than the original, classical converters. The proposed hybrid converters contain the same number of elements as the quadratic converters. Their performances (DC gain, voltage and current stresses on the active switch and diodes, currents through the inductors) are compared to those of the available quadratic converters. The superiority of the new, hybrid converters is mainly based on less energy in the magnetic field, leading to saving in the size and cost of the inductors, and less current stresses in the switching elements, leading to smaller conduction losses. Experimental results confirm the theoretical analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.916403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.916403","startPage":"687","endPage":"696","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4468672/04432307.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4468672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Switched-Capacitor/Switched-Inductor Structures for Getting Transformerless Hybrid DC\u2013DC PWM Converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4432307/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Switched-Capacitor/Switched-Inductor Structures for Getting Transformerless Hybrid DC\u2013DC PWM Converters","volume":"55","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","accessionNumber":"9918767","publicationDate":"March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4432307/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switched-Capacitor/Switched-Inductor Structures for Getting Transformerless Hybrid DC\u2013DC PWM Converters","sourcePdf":"55tcsi02-axelrod.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09858S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4468672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"813","xplore-issue":"4468672","articleId":"4432307","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":4432310,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Large-frequency and clock errors are induced at initial search due to an inaccuracy of crystal oscillators within handsets and could cause fatal performance degradation. In addition to a primary search algorithm for achieving essential pseudo-noise code acquisitions, an enhanced algorithm combining frequency offset compensation, random sample per frame, and sample point reordering is proposed to achieve fast initial search even while an inaccuracy is up to 12 ppm. After a series of trade-off between performance and complexity, two search bins in the first stage are adopted to mitigate possible errors in each bin and make the enhanced schemes become effective. In final, the complete solution is presented with alternative algorithms: a primary one and an enhanced one. The solution is implemented with the flexibility for switching algorithms in different searches and using low-power methods for the sake of handsets' working time.

The required side information is the same as the conventional PTS applying uniform phase factors.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2008.071514","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/4432312/04432321.pdf","startPage":"20","endPage":"22","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2008.071514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432312","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PTS with Non-Uniform Phase Factors for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4432321","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4432321/","displayDocTitle":"PTS with Non-Uniform Phase Factors for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems","volume":"12","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2008","accessionNumber":"9901468","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4432321/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PTS with Non-Uniform Phase Factors for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"cl_0801_020.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04953S","chronDate":"January  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"4432312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4432312","articleId":"4432321","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4432324,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Li","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Li","id":"38089271400"},{"name":"Xian-da Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xian-da","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279337100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"4432324","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":259},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"In this letter, a two-stage hybrid iterative decoding algorithm which combines two iterative decoding algorithms is proposed to reduce the computational complexity of finite geometry low-density parity-check (FG-LDPC) codes.

The system we propose is named Super Quasi Orthogonal Horizontal Layered Space Time Trellis Code (SQOHLSTTC). It consists in a powerful Space-Time Block Code (STBC) based STTC originally derived for a three transmit antenna system, together with an original block based decoding algorithm.

To implement the system, we propose a low complexity hard decision iterative decoding method.

This bioamplifier achieves reduced-size compared to previous designs by means of active low-frequency suppression. An active integrator located in the feedback path of a low-noise amplifier is employed for placing a highpass cutoff frequency within the transfer function. A very long integrating time constant is achieved using a small integrated capacitor and a MOS-bipolar equivalent resistor. This configuration rejects unwanted low-frequency contents without the need for input RC networks or large feedback capacitors. Therefore, the bioamplifier high-input impedance and small size are preserved. The bioamplifier, implemented in a 0.18-mum CMOS process, has been designed for neural recording of action potentials, and optimised through a transconductance-ef-ficiency design methodology for micropower operation. Measured performance and results obtained from in vivo recordings are presented. The integrated bioamplifier provides a midband gain of 50 dB, and achieves an input-referred noise of 5.6 muVrms.

Optimizing the power efficiency of the wireless link is imperative to minimize the size of the external energy source, heating dissipation in the tissue, and interference with other devices. Previous design methodologies for coils made of 1-D filaments are not comprehensive and accurate enough to consider all geometrical aspects of PSCs with planar 3-D conductors as well as design constraints imposed by implantable device application and fabrication technology. We have outlined the theoretical foundation of optimal power transmission efficiency in an inductive link, and combined it with semi-empirical models to predict parasitic components in PSCs. We have used this foundation to devise an iterative PSC design methodology that starts with a set of realistic design constraints and ends with the optimal PSC pair geometries. We have executed this procedure on two design examples at 1 and 5 MHz achieving power transmission efficiencies of 41.2% and 85.8%, respectively, at 10-mm spacing. All results are verified with simulations using a commercial field solver (HFSS) as well as measurements using PSCs fabricated on printed circuit boards.","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2007.913130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2007.913130","startPage":"193","endPage":"202","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4156126/4432383/04432391.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Optimization of Printed Spiral Coils for Efficient Transcutaneous Inductive Power Transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4432391/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Design and Optimization of Printed Spiral Coils for Efficient Transcutaneous Inductive Power Transmission","volume":"1","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9748144","pubMedId":"23852413","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4432391/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Optimization of Printed Spiral Coils for Efficient Transcutaneous Inductive Power Transmission","sourcePdf":"01tbcas03-jow.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087429S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"4432383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"431","xplore-issue":"4432383","articleId":"4432391","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":4432408,"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7381-5634-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4432408","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7697},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE-SASB Coordinating Committees"}],"abstract":"This guide is intended to facilitate the interoperability of distributed resources (DR) and help DR project stakeholders implement monitoring, information exchange, and control (MIC) to support the technical and business operations of DR and transactions among the stakeholders.

We investigate four instrument classes: bass drums, snare drums, high-pitched toms, and low-pitched toms. We evaluate two similarity models: one is defined in the ISO/IEC MPEG-7 standard, and the other is based on auditory images. For the second model, we study the impact of various parameters. We use data from listening tests, and instrument class labels to evaluate the models. Our results show that the model based on auditory images yields a very high average correlation with human similarity ratings and clearly outperforms the MPEG-7 recommendation. The average correlations range from 0.89-0.96 depending on the instrument class. Furthermore, our results indicate that instrument class data can be used as alternative to data from listening tests to evaluate sound similarity models.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2007.910783","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2007.910783","startPage":"408","endPage":"423","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4432632/04432650.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computational Models of Similarity for Drum Samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Computational Models of Similarity for Drum Samples","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","volume":"16","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4432650/","accessionNumber":"9977910","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4432650/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computational Models of Similarity for Drum Samples","sourcePdf":"16tasl02-pampalk.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096591S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4432632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4432632","articleId":"4432650","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4432652,"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Turnbull","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/4432632/4432652/4432652-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Douglas Turnbull (S'08) received the B.S.E. degree (with honors) from Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, in 2001 and the M.S. degree from the University of California at San Diego (UCSD), La Jolla, in 2005.

We collect a data set of 1700 human-generated annotations that describe 500 Western popular music tracks. For each word in a vocabulary, we use this data to train a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) over an audio feature space. We estimate the parameters of the model using the weighted mixture hierarchies expectation maximization algorithm. This algorithm is more scalable to large data sets and produces better density estimates than standard parameter estimation techniques. The quality of the music annotations produced by our system is comparable with the performance of humans on the same task. Our ldquoquery-by-textrdquo system can retrieve appropriate songs for a large number of musically relevant words.

In this paper, we focus on the challenging issue of recognizing the emotion content of music signals, or music emotion recognition (MER). Specifically, we formulate MER as a regression problem to predict the arousal and valence values (AV values) of each music sample directly. Associated with the AV values, each music sample becomes a point in the arousal-valence plane, so the users can efficiently retrieve the music sample by specifying a desired point in the emotion plane. Because no categorical taxonomy is used, the regression approach is free of the ambiguity inherent to conventional categorical approaches. To improve the performance, we apply principal component analysis to reduce the correlation between arousal and valence, and RReliefF to select important features. An extensive performance study is conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the regression approach for predicting AV values. The best performance evaluated in terms of the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</i>\n \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n statistics reaches 58.3% for arousal and 28.1% for valence by employing support vector machine as the regressor. We also apply the regression approach to detect the emotion variation within a music selection and find the prediction accuracy superior to existing works.

This hybrid approach overcomes the conventional tradeoff between recommendation accuracy and variety of recommended artists. Collaborative filtering, which is used on e-commerce sites, cannot recommend nonbrated pieces and provides a narrow variety of artists. Content-based filtering does not have satisfactory accuracy because it is based on the heuristics that the user's favorite pieces will have similar musical content despite there being exceptions. To attain a higher recommendation accuracy along with a wider variety of artists, we use a probabilistic generative model that unifies the collaborative and content-based data in a principled way. This model can explain the generative mechanism of the observed data in the probability theory. The probability distribution over users, pieces, and features is decomposed into three conditionally independent ones by introducing latent variables. This decomposition enables us to efficiently and incrementally adapt the model for increasing numbers of users and rating scores. We evaluated our system by using audio signals of commercial CDs and their corresponding rating scores obtained from an e-commerce site.

The motion of a rotating shaft is mapped by two displacement sensors with a data acquisition system and personal computer. The first critical speed of each configuration is determined experimentally and verified through frequency analysis.

In contrast to the satellite case, application of such a technique to airborne data is not, today, a well-established task. Several airborne campaigns, involving mainly C/L-band data, have been planned in the last years to exploit the potentialities of these more flexible platforms for deformation monitoring.

We discuss the processing chain applied to the acquired data, which allows achieving a satisfactory compromise between accuracy and efficiency. Eleven repeated passes were carried out in two days; two corner reflectors were located on the ground in a hilly region. One corner reflector was vertically moved between the two days to evaluate the system detection capability.

Algorithms based on the differentiated ECG are computationally efficient and hence ideal for real-time analysis of large datasets. Here, we analyze traditional first-derivative based squaring function (Hamilton-Tompkins) and Hilbert transform-based methods for QRS detection and their modifications with improved detection thresholds. On a standard ECG dataset, the Hamilton-Tompkins algorithm had the highest detection accuracy (99.68% sensitivity, 99.63% positive predictivity) but also the largest time error. The modified Hamilton-Tompkins algorithm as well as the Hilbert transform-based algorithms had comparable, though slightly lower, accuracy; yet these automated algorithms present an advantage for real-time applications by avoiding human intervention in threshold determination. The high accuracy of the Hilbert transform-based method compared to detection with the second derivative of the ECG is ascribable to its inherently uniform magnitude spectrum. For all algorithms, detection errors occurred mainly in beats with decreased signal slope, such as wide arrhythmic beats or attenuated beats. For best performance, a combination of the squaring function and Hilbert transform-based algorithms can be applied such that differences in detection will point to abnormalities in the signal that can be further analyzed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of First-Derivative Based QRS Detection Algorithms","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2007.912658","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4432718/04432721.pdf","startPage":"478","endPage":"484","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2007.912658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432718","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4432721","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4432721/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of First-Derivative Based QRS Detection Algorithms","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4432721/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9748157","pubMedId":"18269982","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of First-Derivative Based QRS Detection Algorithms","sourcePdf":"55tbme02-arzeno-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064462S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4432718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"271","xplore-issue":"4432718","articleId":"4432721","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4432776,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey M.

In this paper, we present a novel rate-distortion-complexity (R-D-C) analysis for state-of-the-art wavelet video coding methods by explicitly modeling several aspects found in operational coders, i.e., embedded quantization, quadtree decompositions of block significance maps and context-adaptive entropy coding of subband blocks. This paper achieves two main goals. First, unlike existing R-D models for wavelet video coders, the proposed derivations reveal for the first time the expected coding behavior of specific coding algorithms (e.g., quadtree decompositions, coefficient significance, and refinement coding) and, therefore, can be used for a variety of coding mechanisms incorporating some or all the coding algorithms discussed. Second, the proposed modeling derives for the first time analytical estimates of the expected number of operations (complexity) of a broad class of wavelet video coding algorithms based on stochastic source models, the coding algorithm characteristics and the system parameters. This enables the formulation of an analytical model characterizing the complexity of various video decoding operations. As a result, this paper complements prior complexity-prediction research that is based on operational measurements. The accuracy of the proposed analytical R-D-C expressions is justified against experimental data obtained with a state-of-the-art motion-compensated temporal filtering based wavelet video coder, and several new insights are revealed on the different tradeoffs between rate-distortion performance and the required decoding complexity. </para>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4432777/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4432777/","accessionNumber":"9748109","displayDocTitle":"Analytical Rate-Distortion-Complexity Modeling of Wavelet-Based Video Coders","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical Rate-Distortion-Complexity Modeling of Wavelet-Based Video Coders","sourcePdf":"56tsp02-foo2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094309S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4432769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4432769","articleId":"4432777","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4432779,"authors":[{"name":"Mariane R.

A convergence analysis of the adaptation algorithm is presented, from which its convergence rate and steady-state mean-square error can be estimated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4432779/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4432779/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9748123","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Nonuniform Subband Adaptive Filtering With Critical Sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonuniform Subband Adaptive Filtering With Critical Sampling","sourcePdf":"56tsp02-petraglia.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082351S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4432769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4432769","articleId":"4432779","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4432780,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Rong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Curtin University of Technology, Perth, WA, Australia","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Riverside, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4432769/4432780/4432780-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yue Rong (S'03\u2013M'06) was born in Jiangsu, China, in 1976.

A readily computable expression for the ergodic sum capacity of the MIMO links is derived. Based on this expression, which is a non-convex function of power allocation vectors, a projected gradient algorithm is developed to optimize the power allocation. For a symmetric set of MIMO links with independent identically distributed channels, it is observed that the space-time optimal power schedule reduces to a uniform isotropic power schedule when nominal interference is low, or to an orthogonal isotropic power schedule when nominal interference is high. Furthermore, the transition region between the latter two schedules is seen to be very sharp in terms of nominal interference-to-noise ratio (INR). For MIMO links with correlated channels, the corresponding space-time optimal power schedule is developed based on the knowledge of the channel correlation matrices. It is shown that the channel correlation has a great impact on the ergodic capacity and the optimality of different power scheduling approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.906777","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4432769/04432780.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.906777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432769","startPage":"686","endPage":"701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space\u2013Time Power Schedule for Distributed MIMO Links Without Instantaneous Channel State Information at the Transmitting Nodes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4432780","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Space\u2013Time Power Schedule for Distributed MIMO Links Without Instantaneous Channel State Information at the Transmitting Nodes","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4432780/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9748124","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4432780/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space\u2013Time Power Schedule for Distributed MIMO Links Without Instantaneous Channel State Information at the Transmitting Nodes","sourcePdf":"56tsp02-rong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120153S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4432769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4432769","articleId":"4432780","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4432781,"authors":[{"name":"Mihailo Stojnic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4432769/4432781/4432781-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mihailo Stojnic received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, in 2003, where he is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests are in mathematics applied in electrical engineering problems."]},"firstName":"Mihailo","lastName":"Stojnic","id":"37395583000"},{"name":"Haris Vikalo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4432769/4432781/4432781-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Haris Vikalo was born in Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina.

On the other hand, it has recently been shown that, over a wide range of dimensions N and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), the sphere decoding algorithm can be used to find the exact ML solution with an expected complexity that is often less than N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n. However, the computational complexity of sphere decoding becomes prohibitive if the SNR is too low and/or if the dimension of the problem is too large. In this paper, we target these two regimes and attempt to find faster algorithms by pruning the search tree beyond what is done in the standard sphere decoding algorithm. The search tree is pruned by computing lower bounds on the optimal value of the objective function as the algorithm proceeds to descend down the search tree. We observe a tradeoff between the computational complexity required to compute a lower bound and the size of the pruned tree: the more effort we spend in computing a tight lower bound, the more branches that can be eliminated in the tree.

We propose two families of algorithms, one that is appropriate for large problem dimensions and binary modulation, and the other that is appropriate for moderate-size dimensions yet high-order constellations.

These detectors are called Chase detectors because they can be interpreted as a translation of the Chase error-control decoding algorithm from time to space. The Chase detector is parameterized by only four parameters; nevertheless, it reduces to a wide range of previously reported MIMO detectors as special cases, including the maximum-likelihood and decision-feedback detectors. The Chase detector defines a simple framework for not only comparing existing MIMO detection algorithms but also proposing new ones. For example, based on the Chase framework, we propose a new detector called B-Chase that performs well on fading channels. Specifically, on a four-input four-output Rayleigh-fading channel with uncoded 16-QAM inputs, one instance of the B-Chase detector falls only 0.4 dB short of the performance of the maximum-likelihood sphere detector while reducing complexity by 68%. Another instance of the B-Chase detector outperforms the BLAST-ordered decision-feedback detector by 4.4 dB while increasing complexity by only 17%.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.907904","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4432769/04432783.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.907904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432769","startPage":"739","endPage":"747","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Chase Family of Detection Algorithms for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4432783","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Chase Family of Detection Algorithms for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4432783/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9748132","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4432783/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Chase Family of Detection Algorithms for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Channels","sourcePdf":"56tsp02-waters.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083391S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4432769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4432769","articleId":"4432783","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4432784,"authors":[{"name":"Keyvan Zarifi","affiliation":["Communication Systems Group, Darmstadt University of Technology, Darmstadt, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4432769/4432784/4432784-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Keyvan Zarifi (S'04\u2013M'08) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees, both in electrical engineering from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 1997 and 2000, respectively.

The proposed linked ramp-metering scheme is simple and utterly reactive, i.e., based on readily available real-time measurements without any need for real-time model calculations or external disturbance prediction. The well-known feedback strategy, known as Asservissement LINeaire d'Entree Autoroutiere (ALINEA), is used at a local level. Simulation results are presented for a hypothetical freeway axis with two successive on-ramps. Some pitfalls and misapplications of the local ramp metering are also illustrated via appropriately designed simulation scenarios. The proposed linked strategy is demonstrated to outperform the uncoordinated local ramp metering and, thus, to increase the achievable control benefit over the no-control case. In fact, the new strategy is shown to reach the efficiency of sophisticated proactive optimal control schemes.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Traffic control","Feedback","Optimal control","Communication system traffic control","Coordinate measuring machines","Intelligent transportation systems","Predictive models","Area measurement","Fluid flow measurement","Production engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal control","road traffic","traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic-responsive linked ramp metering control","consecutive on-ramps","freeway mainstream","real-time model calculation","external disturbance prediction","Asservissement LINeaire d'Entree Autoroutiere","hypothetical freeway axis","successive on-ramps","proactive optimal control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ALINEA","coordinated ramp metering","HEuristic Ramp-metering coOrdination (HERO)","linked control"]},{"kwd":["ALINEA","coordinated ramp metering","HEuristic Ramp-metering coOrdination (HERO)","linked control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TITS.2007.908724","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/4459084/04432798.pdf","startPage":"111","endPage":"121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459084","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2007.908724","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic-Responsive Linked Ramp-Metering Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4432798","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Traffic-Responsive Linked Ramp-Metering Control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4432798/","volume":"9","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4432798/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9918417","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic-Responsive Linked Ramp-Metering Control","sourcePdf":"09tits01-papamichail.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061935S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"4459084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"4459084","articleId":"4432798","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4432800,"authors":[{"name":"Maoyin Chen","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology and the Institute of Process Engineering Control, Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4539047/4432800/4432800-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Maoyin Chen received the B.S. degree in mathematics and the M.S. degree in control theory and control engineering from Qufu Normal University, Shandong, China, in 1997, and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, in 2003.","From 2003 to 2005, he worked as a Post-Doctoral Researcher in the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, Chima.

In many past studies, this was achieved by explicitly deriving the Poincare map that describes the evolution of the state from one clock instant to the next and then locally linearizing the map at the fixed point. However, in many converters, the map cannot be derived in closed form, and therefore this approach cannot directly be applied. Alternatively, the orbital stability can be worked out by studying the evolution of perturbations about a nominal periodic orbit, and some studies along this line have also been reported. In this paper, we show that Filippov's method - which has commonly been applied to mechanical switching systems - can be used fruitfully in power electronic circuits to achieve the same end by describing the behavior of the system during the switchings. By combining this and the Floquet theory, it is possible to describe the stability of power electronic converters. We demonstrate the method using the example of a voltage-mode-controlled buck converter operating in continuous conduction mode. We find that the stability of a converter is strongly dependent upon the so-called saltation matrix - the state transition matrix relating the state just after the switching to that just before. We show that the Filippov approach, especially the structure of the saltation matrix, offers some additional insights on issues related to the stability of the orbit, like the recent observation that coupling with spurious signals coming from the environment causes intermittent subharmonic windows. Based on this approach, we also propose a new controller that can significantly extend the parameter range for nominal period-1 operation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4432801/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","volume":"55","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9966167","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4432801/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Stability Analysis of the Continuous-Conduction-Mode Buck Converter Via Filippov's Method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability Analysis of the Continuous-Conduction-Mode Buck Converter Via Filippov's Method","sourcePdf":"55tcsi04-giaouris.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08329S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4516005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"159","xplore-issue":"4516005","articleId":"4432801","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4432803,"authors":[{"name":"Haibin Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4468672/4432803/4432803-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haibin Zhang (M'05) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China in 1992, 1995, and 2002, respectively.","He joined the Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, in 1996, where he became an Associate Professor in 2002.

An encoder architecture is then designed for LAR-LDPC codes, by making two improvements to the Richardson-Urbanke approach: the forward substitution operation is entirely removed and the dense-matrix-vector multiplication is handled using feedback shift-registers. A partially parallel decoder architecture is also designed for LAR-LDPC codes, where a layered modified min-sum decoding algorithm is used to trade off among complexity, speed, and performance. More importantly, the interconnection network, which is inevitable for partially parallel decoders, has much lower hardware complexity compared with that for general LDPC codes. Both the encoder and decoder architectures are highly flexible in code length and code rate.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.916433","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4468672/04432803.pdf","startPage":"572","endPage":"585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4468672","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.916433","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Layered Approx-Regular LDPC: Code Construction and Encoder/Decoder Design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4432803","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","displayDocTitle":"Layered Approx-Regular LDPC: Code Construction and Encoder/Decoder Design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4432803/","publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9918784","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4432803/","volume":"55","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Layered Approx-Regular LDPC: Code Construction and Encoder/Decoder Design","sourcePdf":"55tcsi02-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.170341S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4468672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4468672","articleId":"4432803","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4432805,"authors":[{"name":"Alfio Zanchi","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4468672/4432805/4432805-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alfio Zanchi (S'94\u2013M'01\u2013SM'05) was born in Alzano Lombardo (Bergamo), Italy, in 1971.

or subaquatic robots manipulation, to the sign language used for communication by the peoples with hearing or speech disabilities. This paper shows an application of the artificial neural networks (ANN) implemented in field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) for the hand static gestures (postures) recognition. The adopted recognition method uses an ANN structured on two levels. The first level, a feedforward ANN trained using supervised Hebbian algorithm, is used for input data preprocessing. The second one, used for data classification is a competitive ANN. Using an ANN for input data preprocessing offers flexibility regarding the implementation of a preprocessing method. This combination of two ANN leads to 100% recognition rate for the training set and two other sets of test.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4432909/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9833058","htmlLink":"/document/4432909/","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Hand Postures Recognition System Using Artificial Neural Networks Implemented in FPGA","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hand Postures Recognition System Using Artificial Neural Networks Implemented in FPGA","confLoc":"Cluj-Napoca, Romania","sourcePdf":"ISSE-00-102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041803S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4432806","isNumber":"4432807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4432806","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4432807","articleId":"4432909","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4432921,"authors":[{"name":"Alin Tisan","affiliation":["Electrotechnical Department, North University of Baia Mare, Baia Mare, Romania"],"firstName":"Alin","lastName":"Tisan","id":"37543201700"},{"name":"A.

For this, we have develop a generic blocks designed in Mathworks' Simulink environment, capable to generate the signals for controlling the neurons from a neural network. The main characteristics of those blocks is its high reconfigurability that's makes it suitable for developing of a generic controlling block capable to manage calculus function of neurons from different layers. The properties of the block are set according to the numbers of total layers, number of the neurons from the layers and the number of layer from whom and in different function block parameters windows. The novelty of the proposed method resides in the possibility to design neural networks with on-chip learning only with predefined block systems created in system generator environment. The major benefit of this design methodology result from the possibility to create a higher level design tools used to implement neural networks in logical circuits.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4432921/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9809005","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4432921/","publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","conferenceDate":"9-13 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Generic Control Block for Feedforward Neural Network with On-Chip Delta Rule Learning Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Generic Control Block for Feedforward Neural Network with On-Chip Delta Rule Learning Algorithm","confLoc":"Cluj-Napoca, Romania","sourcePdf":"ISSE-00-114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038733S","chronDate":"9-13 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4432806","isNumber":"4432807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4432806","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4432807","articleId":"4432921","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4432925,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Bucci","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies Austria AG, Graz, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4509511/4432925/4432925-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marco Bucci received the Laurea degree in electronic engineering from the University of Rome \u201cLa Sapienza,\u201d Italy, in 1986.","He was with the Cryptography Group, Fondazione Ugo Bordoni, Italy, from 1986 to 2000.

The low-impedance is enabled by using high-order modes of resonators consisting of a piezoelectric transduction film on an underlying silicon layer. The impedance of these devices reduces as mode number increases. This is attributed to the increase in transduction area. The lowest measured impedance is 55Omega at 373MHz. Resonators with 373MHz and 640MHz lateral modes and 2.5GHz thickness modes from the same substrate are presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 20th International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4432954/4432955/04433094.pdf","startPage":"791","endPage":"794","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 20th International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS)","doi":"10.1109/MEMSYS.2007.4433094","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEMSYS.2007.4433094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432955","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4433094","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-order composite bulk acoustic resonators","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Zinc oxide","Electrodes","Substrates","Piezoelectric films","Frequency","Gold","Micromechanical devices","Surface acoustic waves","Film bulk acoustic resonators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic resonators","piezoelectric thin films"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic resonators","low-impedance UHF resonators","piezoelectric transduction film","silicon layer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4433094/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Jan. 2007","displayDocTitle":"High-order composite bulk acoustic resonators","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4433094/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9827370","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","conferenceDate":"21-25 Jan. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-order composite bulk acoustic resonators","confLoc":"Hyogo, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122008-00139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0577S","chronDate":"21-25 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4432954","isNumber":"4432955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4432954","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4432955","articleId":"4433094","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4433133,"authors":[{"name":"Park Yun-Kwon","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Yongin si, South Korea"],"firstName":"Park","lastName":"Yun-Kwon","id":"38277731800"},{"name":"Nam Kuang-Woo","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Yongin si, South Korea"],"firstName":"Nam","lastName":"Kuang-Woo","id":"38276125700"},{"name":"Yun Seok-Chool","affiliation":["Samsung Electro Mechanics Company Limited, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yun Seok-Chool","id":"38270751700"},{"name":"Ha Byeoung-Ju","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Yongin si, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ha Byeoung-Ju","id":"38273614500"},{"name":"Hong Seog-Woo","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Yongin si, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hong Seog-Woo","id":"38276126400"},{"name":"Kim Chul-Soo","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Yongin si, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kim Chul-Soo","id":"38276139700"},{"name":"Shin Jea-Shik","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Yongin si, South Korea"],"lastName":"Shin Jea-Shik","id":"38271151900"},{"name":"Song In-Sang","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Yongin si, South Korea"],"lastName":"Song In-Sang","id":"38272058700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0950-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1084-6999"}],"articleNumber":"4433133","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":483},"abstract":"FBAR filters and duplexers have high power handling capability, high Q factors, good thermal stability, a low volume, a low cost and IC compatibility their applications have been gradually increased in RF systems. However, there is no published papers and research about FBAR 1-chip duplexer, which was fabricated with Tx and Rx filters because that is a very challenging task. We report for the first time that a monolithic 1-chip RF filter is achieved with the size of 2.5 mm times 2.5 mm using a suspended membrane thin film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) technology to meet stringent demand for miniaturization and monolithic integration of duplexers in RF communication systems. In this work, a novel 1-chip duplexer is designed by EM(electromagnetic) simulation and RF circuit simulation using HFSS and ADS. The highest insertion losses in the pass-band (1920-1980, 2110-2170 MHz) are measured below 3.5 dB. In the Rx band(2110-2170 MHz) the attenuation is the over 45 and the attenuation in the Rx band is the over 54 dB.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 20th International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4432954/4432955/04433133.pdf","startPage":"803","endPage":"806","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 20th International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS)","doi":"10.1109/MEMSYS.2007.4433133","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEMSYS.2007.4433133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432955","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4433133","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fabrication of monolithic 1-Chip FBAR duplexer for W-CDMA handsets","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fabrication","Film bulk acoustic resonators","Multiaccess communication","Telephone sets","Radio frequency","Resonator filters","Circuit simulation","Attenuation","Q factor","Thermal factors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bulk acoustic wave devices","circuit simulation","code division multiple access","integrated circuit design","monolithic integrated circuits","UHF filters","UHF integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["monolithic 1-chip FBAR duplexer","suspended membrane thin film bulk acoustic resonator","W-CDMA handsets","FBAR filters","RF filter","miniaturization","monolithic integration","RF communication systems","electromagnetic simulation","RF circuit simulation","insertion losses","size 2.5 mm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FBAR","1-chip duplexer","shunt inductor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4433133/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Jan. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Fabrication of monolithic 1-Chip FBAR duplexer for W-CDMA handsets","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4433133/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9827409","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","conferenceDate":"21-25 Jan. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fabrication of monolithic 1-Chip FBAR duplexer for W-CDMA handsets","confLoc":"Hyogo, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122008-00178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046769S","chronDate":"21-25 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4432954","isNumber":"4432955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4432954","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4432955","articleId":"4433133","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4433153,"authors":[{"name":"Yuejun Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Yuejun Zhao","id":"37713964300"},{"name":"Ui-Chong Yi","affiliation":["Core Microsolutions, Inc., Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Ui-Chong Yi","id":"37832060600"},{"name":"Sung Kwon Cho","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Sung Kwon Cho","id":"37407419400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0950-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1084-6999"}],"articleNumber":"4433153","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":204},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microfluidics","Electrodes","Dielectrophoresis","Glass","Transportation","Electrokinetics","Microchannel","Mechanical engineering","Materials science and technology","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrophoresis","microfluidics","wetting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["in-droplet particle concentration","twDEP","EWOD","digital microfluidics","traveling wave dielectrophoresis","electrowetting-on-dielectric actuation"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes highly efficient in-droplet particle concentrations/separations (over 92% efficiency), where target particles are concentrated/separated within a droplet by traveling wave dielectrophoresis (twDEP) and a subsequent EWOD (electrowetting-on-dielectric) actuation physically splits target-rich regions into individual droplets.

The novel system is based on a microfluidic disc fabricated by hot embossing which features 100 protein crystallization chambers enabling up to 100 different crystallization experiments in parallel. The mi- crostructures exhibit minimal feature sizes of 30mum and a maximum aspect ratio of 1. The fluidic design of the disc enables lamination of nanoliter volumes of protein and crystallization solution (precipitant) in a crystallization chamber of minimum volume of 5 nL. The protein sample is loaded to the disc by a non-contact nL-dispenser with a minimal dosage volume of 1 nL and dead volume of only 500 nL. All liquid processing steps on the disc are accomplished by centrifugal forces caused by rotation of the disc. Up to 80mum large crystals of catalase, lysozyme, proteinase K and insulin, have been produced on the disc to demonstrate the proper performance. Subsequently the crystals have been analyzed in situ in an X-ray experiment without removing them from the disc.","doi":"10.1109/MEMSYS.2007.4433159","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 20th International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 20th International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4432954/4432955/04433159.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEMSYS.2007.4433159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432955","startPage":"561","endPage":"564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Miniaturized and highly parallel protein crystallization on a microfluidic disc","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4433159","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Miniaturized and highly parallel protein crystallization on a microfluidic disc","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Jan. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4433159/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 Jan. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9827434","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4433159/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Miniaturized and highly parallel protein crystallization on a microfluidic disc","confLoc":"Hyogo, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122008-00204.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067581S","chronDate":"21-25 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4432954","isNumber":"4432955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4432954","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4432955","articleId":"4433159","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4433168,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Characteristics of a ring-gate 1.4-pitch 50% fill-factor pixel are compared with those of a rectangular-gate 2.2-pitch 46% fill-factor pixel, both being in a 0.13- complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor process. The 1.4-pitch ring-gate pixel has an improved conversion gain and a degraded full well capacity (FWC), as can be roughly predicted according to scaling law.

As the bandwidth of the baseband data increases, carefully designed cascaded digital filters are required in order to attenuate the wide replicas generated during the digital up-sampling process. Though design methodologies for single stage digital filters are very well established, near-optimum design of such multistage filters typically requires selection of several parameters by trial-and-error. This approach is time-consuming and does not assure the optimum solution (i.e. lowest area/power) under various performance constraints. In this paper, a genetic algorithm (GA) based generic automated search methodology for design of such cascaded filters is proposed. The proposed technique is demonstrated for digital WiMAX and WCDMA transmitters, for which near-optimal solutions appear to have been achieved in a relatively short time compared to the traditional manual design techniques.","doi":"10.1109/DCAS.2007.4433199","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 6th IEEE Dallas Circuits and Systems Workshop on System-on-Chip","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433189/4433190/04433199.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 6th IEEE Dallas Circuits and Systems Workshop on System-on-Chip","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DCAS.2007.4433199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4433190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Design of Cascaded Digital Filters in Wideband Wireless Transmitters using Genetic Algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Digital filters","Wideband","Transmitters","Genetic algorithms","Baseband","Design methodology","Radio frequency","Bandwidth","WiMAX"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4433199/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Design of Cascaded Digital Filters in Wideband Wireless Transmitters using Genetic Algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4433199/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","conferenceDate":"15-16 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Design of Cascaded Digital Filters in Wideband Wireless Transmitters using Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"DCAS07-00-9.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088768S","chronDate":"15-16 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4433189","isNumber":"4433190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433189","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4433190","articleId":"4433199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4433206,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Guarisco","affiliation":["Laboratoire dInstrumentation Electronique de Nancy, Nancy University, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Guarisco","id":"37570907800"},{"name":"Xun Zhang","affiliation":["Laboratoire dInstrumentation Electronique de Nancy, Nancy University, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Xun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37834462400"},{"name":"Hassan Rabah","affiliation":["Laboratoire dInstrumentation Electronique de Nancy, Nancy University, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Rabah","id":"37277808200"},{"name":"Serge Weber","affiliation":["Laboratoire dInstrumentation Electronique de Nancy, Nancy University, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Serge","lastName":"Weber","id":"37277804200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1679-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1680-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4433206","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Filters","Hardware","Filtering","Bandwidth","Continuous wavelet transforms","Frequency","Wavelet domain"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents efficient reconfigurable architecture to perform discret wavelet transform.

One of the main candidates for WPAN standardization is the multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MB-OFDM), supported by the Multiband OFDM Alliance (MBOA). In this paper, we propose a new low- complexity resource allocation algorithm applied to a spread spectrum multicarrier multiple-access (SS-MC-MA) waveform, which is new for high data rate UWB applications. The proposed scheme aims at maximizing the system's throughput while taking into consideration the WPAN environment and respecting the OFDM parameters of the MBOA solution. The adaptive allocation algorithm applied to OFDM and SS-MC-MA leads to roughly double the throughput compared to the MBOA solution at low attenuation levels. Furthermore, at high attenuation levels, SS- MC-MA outperforms the adaptive OFDM. Hence, we conclude that the proposed adaptive SS-MC-MA can especially be advantageously exploited for high attenuation UWB applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource allocation for multicarrier CDMA systems in ultra-wideband communications","publicationTitle":"2006 International Telecommunications Symposium","doi":"10.1109/ITS.2006.4433257","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Telecommunications Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433229/4433230/04433257.pdf","startPage":"135","endPage":"140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITS.2006.4433257","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4433230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4433257","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4433257/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Resource allocation for multicarrier CDMA systems in ultra-wideband communications","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4433257/","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9833808","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource allocation for multicarrier CDMA systems in ultra-wideband communications","confLoc":"Fortaleza, Brazil","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122008-00027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080901S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2006","isNumber":"4433230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433229","citationCount":"2","articleId":"4433257","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4433260,"authors":[{"name":"R.D.

The electrical optical (E/O) conversion in such systems introduces relevant nonlinear distortion and, consequently, the overall channel can be viewed as a convolutive post nonlinear (CPNL) mixture. The proposed techniques for system identification exploit the use of orthonormal basis functions to accelerate the convergence of the least mean square (LMS) algorithm and to decouple the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimation in a block-processing scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Telecommunications Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433229/4433230/04433272.pdf","startPage":"213","endPage":"218","publicationTitle":"2006 International Telecommunications Symposium","doi":"10.1109/ITS.2006.4433272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITS.2006.4433272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4433230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4433272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of nonlinear MIMO radio over fiber uplink channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Optical fiber communication","Nonlinear systems","Communication channels","Fiber nonlinear optics","Nonlinear optics","Optical distortion","Nonlinear distortion","System identification","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence of numerical methods","distortion","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","radio-over-fibre","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-input multiple-output nonlinear system","MIMO","radio over fiber uplink communication channel","electrical optical conversion","nonlinear distortion","convolutive post nonlinear mixture","orthonormal basis function","convergence","least mean square algorithm","minimum mean squared error estimation","block processing scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nonlinear systems","MIMO","Radio Over Fiber","Orthonormal Basis Functions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4433272/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Identification of nonlinear MIMO radio over fiber uplink channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4433272/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9833823","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of nonlinear MIMO radio over fiber uplink channels","confLoc":"Fortaleza, Brazil","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122008-00042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071357S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4433229","isNumber":"4433230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433229","xplore-issue":"4433230","articleId":"4433272","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4433275,"authors":[{"name":"Danilo Zanatta Filho","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory for Communications (DSPCom), State University of Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil","Laboratory of Electronics and Communications, Conservatoire National des Arts et M\u00e9tiers, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Danilo","lastName":"Zanatta Filho","id":"37331166300"},{"name":"Luc Fety","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electronics and Communications, Conservatoire National des Arts et M\u00e9tiers, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Luc","lastName":"Fety","id":"37372147300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-85-89748-04-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4433275","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Array signal processing","Bit error rate","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Mobile antennas","Laboratories","Rayleigh channels","Web and internet services","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","radio links","Rayleigh channels","Rician channels","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint transmit diversity","downlink beamforming","minimum BER criterion","optimum precoder","virtual antenna","Rayleigh channel","Rician channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Minimum BER","smart antennas","multiple antennas","MIMO","downlink beamforming","precoder","transmit diversity","channel correlation","antenna correlation","STBC"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4433275","doi":"10.1109/ITS.2006.4433275","publicationTitle":"2006 International Telecommunications Symposium","abstract":"In this work, we propose a novel criterion to find the optimum precoder for joint transmit diversity and downlink beamforming. This precoder is an extension of the purely spatial downlink beamforming and can be seen as a transformation that transforms K real antennas into L virtual antennas, with L les K. The proposed criterion is based on the minimization of the received BER and extends the previous technique [1] (Eigen- Beamforming) to any type of channel distribution, not only Rayleigh. Simulation results show that the proposed technique is equivalent to Eigen-Beamforming for Rayleigh channel, but outperforms the latter for Rician channels, providing substantial improvement. This makes the proposed technique an attractive solution for the general application, where the channel type is not known a priori.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITS.2006.4433275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4433230","startPage":"231","endPage":"236","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Telecommunications Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433229/4433230/04433275.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint transmit diversity and downlink beamforming by using a minimum BER criterion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4433275/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4433275/","displayDocTitle":"Joint transmit diversity and downlink beamforming by using a minimum BER criterion","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9833826","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint transmit diversity and downlink beamforming by using a minimum BER criterion","confLoc":"Fortaleza, Brazil","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122008-00045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046502S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4433229","isNumber":"4433230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433229","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4433230","articleId":"4433275","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4433278,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Jos de Sousa","affiliation":["Departamento de Engenharia Eltrica e de Computao, Universidade Federal do Para, Belem, Para, Brazil"],"firstName":"Marco Jos de","lastName":"Sousa","id":"37087171501"},{"name":"Claudomiro Souza Sales","affiliation":["Departamento de Engenharia Eltrica e de Computao, Universidade Federal do Para, Belem, Para, Brazil"],"firstName":"Claudomiro Souza","lastName":"Sales","id":"37411705000"},{"name":"Joo Chamma C.

After recalling some concepts of the decorrelating detector and the optimum multiuser detector, a parallel group detector which combines the advantages of both structures is introduced. The receiver derived here exploits the signal users' correlation in an uplink synchronous code-division multiple access channel, resulting in a structure whose performance ranges from the decorrelating detector to the optimum multiuser detector, depending on the number of groups and on the number of users assigned to those groups. As in group detection the problem of how to compose groups arises, a grouping strategy that minimizes the bit error probability of the user with worst performance in the entire system is developed. Examples illustrating the performance of the proposed grouping strategy are also provided.","doi":"10.1109/ITS.2006.4433311","publicationTitle":"2006 International Telecommunications Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Telecommunications Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433229/4433230/04433311.pdf","startPage":"426","endPage":"431","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITS.2006.4433311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4433230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A grouping strategy for parallel group detection in synchronous gaussian CDMA channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4433311","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4433311/","displayDocTitle":"A grouping strategy for parallel group detection in synchronous gaussian CDMA channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9833862","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4433311/","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A grouping strategy for parallel group detection in synchronous gaussian CDMA channels","confLoc":"Fortaleza, Brazil","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122008-00081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053407S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4433229","isNumber":"4433230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433229","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4433230","articleId":"4433311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4433314,"authors":[{"name":"Gustavo Correa Lima","affiliation":["Communications Research Group (GPqCom), Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), Florian\u00f3polis, SC, Brazil"],"firstName":"Gustavo","lastName":"Correa Lima","id":"38258557800"},{"name":"Luciano Leonel Mendes","affiliation":["National Institute of Telecommunications, INATEL, Santa Rita do Sapucai, Minas Gerais, Brazil","National Institute of Telecommunications (INATEL), MG, Brazil"],"firstName":"Luciano Leonel","lastName":"Mendes","id":"37299801900"},{"name":"Carlos Aurelio F. da Rocha","affiliation":["Communications Research Group (GPqCom), Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), Florian\u00f3polis, SC, Brazil"],"firstName":"Carlos Aurelio F.","lastName":"da Rocha","id":"37347179400"},{"name":"Renato Baldini Filho","affiliation":["State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil"],"firstName":"Renato","lastName":"Baldini Filho","id":"37286193600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-85-89748-04-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4433314","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Channel estimation","MIMO","OFDM","Digital TV","Proposals","Interpolation","Government","Space technology","Physical layer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","digital television","diversity reception","interpolation","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","channel estimation","MIMO OFDM system","digital TV","space-time diversity","interpolation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadcasting","Digital TV","OFDM","MIMO","Systems"]}],"abstract":"In 2005 the Brazilian government supported researches in order to design a new DTV standard which would employ the most recent technologies.

This paper presents some algorithms where the estimation at pilot subcarriers is obtained through a linear combination of two received symbols, and interpolation is done to provide channel gains at data carriers. As the proposed system has the pilot subcarriers positioned in such manner to allow bi-dimensional interpolation, four possible algorithms are evaluated through computer simulations.

Classical transmit diversity is then applied to these virtual antennas. We propose a design criterion to optimize the precoders in order to find the best trade-off between minimizing the interference generated towards the other users and maximizing the channel diversity for the desired user.

The proposed OLPC algorithm can take full advantage of the HARQ protocol since its operation is not affected by the signaling delay between node B and radio network controller (RNC). However, when the Node B-located OLPC is considered in a soft handover (SHO) situation, the Carrier-to-interference Ratio (CIR)-drift problem that emerges compromises the OLPC performance, and some mechanism to compensate for the CIR-drift problem is required. Both an aggressively tuned anti-windup function and an retransmission sequence number (RSN)-based functionality handle this problem. The proposed Node B-located OLPC is evaluated for 2 ms and 10 ms transmission time intervals (TTIs). It is observed that the Node B-located OLPC provides gains in terms of lower CIR and is more beneficial for 2 ms TTI, since the RNC signaling delay has rather severe impact in a shorter round trip time (RTT).","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Telecommunications Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433229/4433230/04433360.pdf","startPage":"682","endPage":"687","publicationTitle":"2006 International Telecommunications Symposium","doi":"10.1109/ITS.2006.4433360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITS.2006.4433360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4433230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4433360","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outer-loop power control based on hybrid ARQ protocol for WCDMA enhanced uplink","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Automatic repeat request","Protocols","Multiaccess communication","Quality of service","Radio control","Delay effects","Downlink","System performance","Peer to peer computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","broadband networks","code division multiple access","power control","radio networks","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outer-loop power control","hybrid ARQ protocol","WCDMA enhanced uplink","hybrid automatic repeat request transmission attempts","signaling delay","radio network controller","soft handover","carrier-to-interference ratio","retransmission sequence number"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["E-UL","OLPC","RRM","HARQ","SHO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4433360/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Outer-loop power control based on hybrid ARQ protocol for WCDMA enhanced uplink","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4433360/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9833911","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outer-loop power control based on hybrid ARQ protocol for WCDMA enhanced uplink","confLoc":"Fortaleza, Brazil","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122008-00130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103327S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4433229","isNumber":"4433230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433229","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4433230","articleId":"4433360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4433363,"authors":[{"name":"Carmelo J.

In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a genetic algorithm for the enhancement of network performance by optimization of the gain of each amplifier in the network. The gain of each amplifier in the network is coded in a bit string. These strings are optimized through evolutionary processes such as crossover, mutation and selection, which is based on minimum network blocking probabilities. We show that this algorithm is able to improve considerably the overall network performance. Parameters such as the network load, output saturation power of amplifiers, initial population and number of generations used in the genetic algorithm are considered and their effects are analyzed.","doi":"10.1109/ITS.2006.4433363","startPage":"700","endPage":"705","publicationTitle":"2006 International Telecommunications Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITS.2006.4433363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4433230","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Telecommunications Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433229/4433230/04433363.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithm for amplifiers gain optimization in all-optical networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4433363/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm for amplifiers gain optimization in all-optical networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4433363/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9833914","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm for amplifiers gain optimization in all-optical networks","confLoc":"Fortaleza, Brazil","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122008-00133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056557S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4433229","isNumber":"4433230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433229","xplore-issue":"4433230","articleId":"4433363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4433368,"authors":[{"name":"Eduardo Mobilon","affiliation":["CPqD Telecom & IT Solutions, Campinas, SP, Brazil"],"firstName":"Eduardo","lastName":"Mobilon","id":"37541118700"},{"name":"Marcos R.

A tensor decomposition known as PARAFAC is used as the core of a multi- stream space-time-frequency coder that jointly multiplex and spreads several input streams over space (transmit antennas), time (symbol periods) and frequency (subcarriers). We coin the term trilinear STF codes since each input symbol is coded over a space-time-frequency grid by a triple product code: each trilinearly coded symbol is interpreted as an element of a third-order tensor, which can be decomposed using PAFAFAC analysis. Trilinear STF codes are designed for an arbitrary number of transmit and receive antennas. They afford a variable degree of multiplexing-spreading over each one of the three signal dimensions while providing full diversity gain for each multiplexed stream. At the receiver, a direct blind decoding based on a relatively simple linear processing is made possible thanks to the PARAFAC modeling of the received signal. Computer simulation results are provided for performance assessment of the proposed codes in a variety of configurations.","doi":"10.1109/ITS.2006.4433375","publicationTitle":"2006 International Telecommunications Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Telecommunications Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433229/4433230/04433375.pdf","startPage":"764","endPage":"770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITS.2006.4433375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4433230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trilinear Space-Time-Frequency Codes for broadband MIMO-OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4433375","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4433375/","displayDocTitle":"Trilinear Space-Time-Frequency Codes for broadband MIMO-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9833926","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4433375/","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trilinear Space-Time-Frequency Codes for broadband MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Fortaleza, Brazil","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122008-00145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055624S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4433229","isNumber":"4433230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433229","xplore-issue":"4433230","articleId":"4433375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4433378,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Motivated by the multidimensional nature of the wireless signal, the PARAllel FACtor tensor decomposition (PARAFAC) is an interesting approach to mitigate multiuser interferences and to reconstruct the transmitted signal of each user at the base station receiver. Furthermore, the PARAFAC decomposition is a simple and elegant multidimensional decomposition that offers easily interpretable signal models for the considered systems. The two supervised receiver structures differ on the type of spreading code sequence employed at the transmitter, which can be either a conventional Hadamard-Walsh sequence or a truncated Hadamard-Walsh sequence. Performance evaluation of the two proposed receivers is made from the analysis of the bit error rate (BER) and the convergence speed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Telecommunications Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433229/4433230/04433386.pdf","startPage":"829","endPage":"834","publicationTitle":"2006 International Telecommunications Symposium","doi":"10.1109/ITS.2006.4433386","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITS.2006.4433386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4433230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4433386","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of supervised PARAFAC receivers for CDMA systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Multidimensional systems","Error correction","Error correction codes","Bit error rate","Wireless communication","Tensile stress","Interference","Base stations","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","error statistics","Hadamard codes","multiuser detection","radio receivers","signal reconstruction","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","supervised PARAFAC receivers","CDMA systems","wireless communication systems","code division multiple access","wireless signal","parallel factor tensor decomposition","multiuser interferences","singal reconstruction","base station receiver","spreading code sequence","truncated Hadamard-Walsh sequence","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Tensor decomposition","communications systems","array processors","identification","equalization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4433386/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of supervised PARAFAC receivers for CDMA systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4433386/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9871826","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of supervised PARAFAC receivers for CDMA systems","confLoc":"Fortaleza, Brazil","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122008-00156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086431S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4433229","isNumber":"4433230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433229","xplore-issue":"4433230","articleId":"4433386","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4433390,"authors":[{"name":"Joao Luiz Rebelatto","affiliation":["DAELN, UTFPR, Curitiba, PR, Brazil"],"firstName":"Joao Luiz","lastName":"Rebelatto","id":"37546202100"},{"name":"Richard Demo Souza","affiliation":["DAELN, UTFPR, Curitiba, PR, Brazil"],"firstName":"Richard Demo","lastName":"Souza","id":"37275937500"},{"name":"Leonardo Silva Resende","affiliation":["GPQCOM, UFSC, Florian\u00f3polis, SC, Brazil"],"firstName":"Leonardo Silva","lastName":"Resende","id":"37284924700"},{"name":"Maurice G.

For a large number of users, the channel conditions seen by different users vary independently and, consequently, it is likely that at any one time slot the scheduler will find at least one user whose channel is in favorable conditions (large SNR), yielding what is called multiuser diversity. In fading channels, where the fluctuation dynamics of the channel are limited, opportunistic beamforming (OBF) which employs multiple antennas at the BS can be used. By varying the antenna gains (power and phase) in a random manner, to induce faster and larger fluctuations in fading channels, OBF achieves multiuser diversity. In this paper we propose an enhancement of OBF to improve the overall throughput. By saving at the BS the sequence of antenna gains for each user, along with the corresponding SNRs, for as long as the channel time-coherence is significant, the proposed system can adopt for the selected user the most appropriate antenna gain in the memory, rather than the current gain, as in the original OBF approach. Computer simulation results for the Jakes-correlated fading channels indicate a favorable throughput performance. Moreover, the new approach requires only BS updates, facilitating its adoption.","doi":"10.1109/ITS.2006.4433422","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Telecommunications Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433229/4433230/04433422.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4433230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITS.2006.4433422","publicationTitle":"2006 International Telecommunications Symposium","startPage":"1024","endPage":"1029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced opportunistic beamforming for Jakes-correlated fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4433422","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced opportunistic beamforming for Jakes-correlated fading channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4433422/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4433422/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9833970","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced opportunistic beamforming for Jakes-correlated fading channels","confLoc":"Fortaleza, Brazil","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122008-00192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054358S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4433229","isNumber":"4433230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433229","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4433230","articleId":"4433422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4433426,"authors":[{"name":"Jianquan Lu","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, South-East University, Nanjing, China","Department of Mathematics, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4539047/4433426/4433426-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jianquan Lu received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Zhejiang Normal University, Zhejiang, China, in 2003, and the M.S. degree in mathematics from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2006.

Based on the invariant principle of functional differential equations, the strength of the feedback controller is enhanced adaptively to stabilize and synchronize chaotic Lur'e systems. The derivative-constraint that the time-varying delay is required to be differentiable and its derivation is less than one can be removed by using LaSalle-Razumikhin-type theorems. The time-varying delay is allowed to be bounded without any additional constraint or unbounded with derivative-constraint. This method is analytical, rigorous and simple to implement in practice. In addition, it is quite robust against the effect of parameters uncertainty and noise. Two examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The results of the paper demonstrate the fruitfulness of the modern feedback and adaptive control theory application to the stabilization and synchronization problems for delayed chaotic systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4433426/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 June 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10050668","volume":"55","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4433426/","publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Stabilization and Synchronization for Chaotic Lur'e Systems With Time-Varying Delay","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Stabilization and Synchronization for Chaotic Lur'e Systems With Time-Varying Delay","sourcePdf":"55tcsi05-lu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075572S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4539047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"4539047","articleId":"4433426","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4433438,"authors":[{"name":"Khalid Eltahir Mohamed","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Communications Systems, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"lastName":"Khalid Eltahir Mohamed","id":"38227904300"},{"name":"Borhanuddin Mohd.

So in this paper we design a set of short orthogonal sequences and the placement of pilot subcarriers is optimized with the existence of virtual subcarriers. By the proposed pilot design, the interference among transmit antennas could be minimized.

The numerical results show that the performance of the proposed system in terms of spectral efficiency is better than that of the existing systems.","doi":"10.1109/APCC.2007.4433485","publicationTitle":"2007 Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433429/4433430/04433485.pdf","startPage":"531","endPage":"534","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCC.2007.4433485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4433430","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint layer resource allocation for multimedia packet CDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4433485","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4433485/","displayDocTitle":"Joint layer resource allocation for multimedia packet CDMA systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9864052","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4433485/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint layer resource allocation for multimedia packet CDMA systems","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"SPI-01142008-00055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05107S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4433429","isNumber":"4433430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433429","xplore-issue":"4433430","articleId":"4433485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4433501,"authors":[{"name":"Khomkris Mathiang","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Khomkris","lastName":"Mathiang","id":"37832293100"},{"name":"Orachat Chitsobhuk","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Orachat","lastName":"Chitsobhuk","id":"37395874600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1373-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1374-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-0771"}],"articleNumber":"4433501","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":25},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Context modeling","Discrete wavelet transforms","Computer architecture","Transform coding","Materials requirements planning","Design engineering","Field programmable gate arrays","Delay","Multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","field programmable gate arrays","image coding","integrated circuit design","multiplexing equipment","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pass-pipelined VLSI architecture","JPEG2000","FPGA","critical path delay","multiple symbol context","data multiplexer","memory access","frequency 100 MHz"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a design of pass-pipelined architecture for context modeling implemented on FPGA is proposed.

Since pilot signals are usually limited, channel estimation often involves interpolation. How to perform channel interpolation/estimation in high-mobility scenario is then a challenge problem. This is particularly true for an OFDM system operated in long-delay- profile channels. In this paper, we consider the channel estimation problem in IEEE802.16e systems. Using the special structure defined in the system, we propose an effective channel estimation algorithm. The main idea is to perform a two-dimensional interpolation with a cascade of two one-dimensional interpolations, one is linear and the other is nonlinear.

In this paper, a novel joint Spatial and Frequency Proportional Fairness (SFPF) scheduler is proposed to achieve the spatial- frequency multiuser diversity gain for multiuser ZFB based MIMO OFDMA system while guarantees the multiuser fairness. To approach the spatial multiuser diversity gain, three antenna selection algorithms are proposed, optimal, random and suboptimal antenna selection and their performance is evaluated in a single cell scenario. The optimal algorithm can achieve the best performance but has the highest complexity.

TFI- OFDM can multiplex the same impulse responses in twice on the time domain without overlapping to each other. By averaging of these impulse responses, we can obtain the accurate channel impulse response.","doi":"10.1109/APCC.2007.4433520","publicationTitle":"2007 Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433429/4433430/04433520.pdf","startPage":"153","endPage":"156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCC.2007.4433520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4433430","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-frequency interferometry for OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4433520","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4433520/","displayDocTitle":"Time-frequency interferometry for OFDM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9863988","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4433520/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-frequency interferometry for OFDM","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"SPI-01142008-00090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041478S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4433429","isNumber":"4433430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433429","xplore-issue":"4433430","articleId":"4433520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4433521,"authors":[{"name":"Wisam F.

This technique is used in a system based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). OFDM has many orthogonally modulated subcarriers which unexpectedly give a large peak to average power ratio (PAPR) and tends to reduce the power efficiency of a RF amplifier. A sequence of input data is rearranged by PTS for the reduction of PAPR and then fed to APPR process in the proposed system. The APPR method controls the peak level of the modulation signal by an adaptive algorithm. It reduces modulation signals over a predefined range. A proposed reduction method consists of these two methods and realizes both advantages at the same time. In simulation results, the proposed method shows the improvement on PAPR and also the high performance on bit error rate performance of an OFDM system.","doi":"10.1109/APCC.2007.4433523","publicationTitle":"2007 Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433429/4433430/04433523.pdf","startPage":"145","endPage":"148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCC.2007.4433523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4433430","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new PAPR reduction in OFDM-WLAN systems by hybrid algorithm of PTS and APPR methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4433523","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4433523/","displayDocTitle":"A new PAPR reduction in OFDM-WLAN systems by hybrid algorithm of PTS and APPR methods","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9864062","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4433523/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new PAPR reduction in OFDM-WLAN systems by hybrid algorithm of PTS and APPR methods","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"SPI-01142008-00093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041735S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4433429","isNumber":"4433430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433429","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4433430","articleId":"4433523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4433524,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Zhou","affiliation":["YRP R&D Center, Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Liang Zhou","id":"37273734300"},{"name":"Yasuyuki Oishi","affiliation":["YRP R&D Center, Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Yasuyuki Oishi","id":"37276013400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1373-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1374-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-0771"}],"articleNumber":"4433524","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"abstract":"In this paper, we study performance improvement for double space time transmit diversity (D-STTD) with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system. The D-STTD OFDM system can achieve both spatial diversity and multiplexing gains simultaneously in frequency selective MIMO channels. For this system, zero forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) linear receivers are derived by a simple transformation. To improve error rate performance, we propose weighted soft decision Viterbi decoding by using the SINR of the transformed equivalent channel matrix. The proposed scheme can mitigate noise enhancement inherent to ZF and MMSE linear detectors.

this paper we have analyzed the performance of adapting beamforming techniques to the Ad-hoc communication between moving vehicles. For the analysis we measured the wireless channel characteristics while moving in high speeds with two vehicles, a transmitter and a receiver. After analyzing the measurement data we found out that the effect of fading can be reduced significantly (9 dB with 99% reliability). Also, the reliable communication range can be increased from not only the beamforming gain but also the gain obtained by reducing the effects of fading. Additionally, in this paper we have analyzed the effects of beamforming to the RMS delay spread using our collected data. Through our analysis we conclude that with beamforming techniques, the adaptive equalizer can be simplified in moving channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4433531/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9864022","htmlLink":"/document/4433531/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of beamforming techniques in ad-hoc communication between moving vehicles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of beamforming techniques in ad-hoc communication between moving vehicles","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"SPI-01142008-00101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059968S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4433429","isNumber":"4433430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433429","xplore-issue":"4433430","articleId":"4433531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4433546,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Channel estimation in time-domain (TD) as well as frequency-domain (FD) is investigated through exploiting preambles and pilot symbols inserted in TD and FD, respectively. The channel is assumed to be slowly time-varying frequency-selective, constant during one OFDM symbol but changing from symbol to symbol. Simulation results show that the TD EW-RLS estimator has better estimation performance in terms of the mean-squares error (MSE) and bit-error rate (BER), compared to FD EW-RLS estimation approach. The computational complexity is significantly reduced by recursively updating the channel estimates and by applying the matrix inversion lemma.","doi":"10.1109/APCC.2007.4433546","publicationTitle":"2007 Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433429/4433430/04433546.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCC.2007.4433546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4433430","startPage":"547","endPage":"550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO OFDM channel estimation based on RLS algorithm: the time- versus frequency-domain implementations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4433546","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO OFDM channel estimation based on RLS algorithm: the time- versus frequency-domain implementations","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4433546/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9864067","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4433546/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO OFDM channel estimation based on RLS algorithm: the time- versus frequency-domain implementations","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"SPI-01142008-00116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067283S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4433429","isNumber":"4433430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433429","xplore-issue":"4433430","articleId":"4433546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4433547,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Two stages of neural networks (NN) are used for expression classification. The first stage neural network based on Hebbian learning is used for estimating principal components (PC) for dimension reduction. The second stage neural network based on supervised competitive learning is used for classifying expressions as normal, happy or surprised. The performance analysis of the proposed algorithm is validated by tabulating confusion matrices and thereby plotting receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. Classification rates of 100% and 91.67% are achieved respectively for classification and generalization. The effectiveness of the proposed classification algorithm is highlighted by comparing its performance with another algorithm based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA).","doi":"10.1109/MED.2007.4433666","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Mediterranean Conference on Control & Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433643/4433644/04433666.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 Mediterranean Conference on Control & Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MED.2007.4433666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4433644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Facial expression recognition using a two stage neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Neural networks","Linear discriminant analysis","Face detection","User interfaces","Humanoid robots","Humans","Artificial intelligence","Intelligent robots","Hidden Markov models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["facial expression recognition","two stage neural network","facial expression classification","dimension reduction","supervised competitive learning","linear discriminant analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural Network","Normalization","Facial Expression classification","Principal components","ROC curves"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4433666/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Facial expression recognition using a two stage neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4433666/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9871500","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Facial expression recognition using a two stage neural network","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122008-00022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070041S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4433643","isNumber":"4433644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433643","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4433644","articleId":"4433666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4433707,"authors":[{"name":"Kyriakos G.

The sensor package consists of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a laser-based vision system (LVS). The LVS consists of two undewater laser pointers and a single CCD camera mounted on the ROV. The LVS fuses data deriving from the projection of the laser pointers on the image plane while it tracks a target at the same plane using computer vision algorithms. The LVS calculates the position vector of the vehicle at a low frequency, with respect to the center of the tracked object. The IMU measures the accelerations and angular velocities of the vehicle at a high frequency. The fusion of the two sensors is based on a multisensor Kalman filter where the measured acceleration and angular velocity of the IMU is fed directly to the filter. The result is the calculation of the position vector at a high frequency, which can be used for a smooth closed loop steering control of the vehicle. The integration of the system was proved successful through an extensive experimental procedure.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Mediterranean Conference on Control & Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433643/4433644/04433777.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2007 Mediterranean Conference on Control & Automation","doi":"10.1109/MED.2007.4433777","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MED.2007.4433777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4433644","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4433777","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Localization of an underwater vehicle using an IMU and a laser-based vision system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Underwater vehicles","Machine vision","Remotely operated vehicles","Frequency","Target tracking","Velocity measurement","Acceleration","Angular velocity","Underwater tracking","Sensor systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inertial navigation","mobile robots","position control","remotely operated vehicles","robot vision","sensor fusion","steering systems","tracking","underwater vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["localization","underwater vehicle","IMU","laser-based vision system","position tracking system","remotely operated vehicle","sensor package","inertial measurement unit","undewater laser pointers","CCD camera","data fusion","smooth closed loop steering control","vehicle steering control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Laser pointers","underwater vision","IMU","ROV","Multisensor Kalman Filter","guidance and control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4433777/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Localization of an underwater vehicle using an IMU and a laser-based vision system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4433777/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9826025","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Localization of an underwater vehicle using an IMU and a laser-based vision system","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122008-00133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037496S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4433643","isNumber":"4433644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433643","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4433644","articleId":"4433777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4433808,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A classifier induced from an imbalanced data set has, typically, a low error rate for the majority class and an unacceptable error rate for the minority class. This paper firstly provides a systematic study on the various methodologies that have tried to handle this problem. Finally, it presents an experimental study of these methodologies with a proposed local cost sensitive technique and it concludes that such a framework can be a more effective solution to the problem. Our method seems to allow improved identification of difficult small classes in predictive analysis, while keeping the classification ability of the other classes in an acceptable level.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4433808/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9825946","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4433808/","publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Local cost sensitive learning for handling imbalanced data sets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local cost sensitive learning for handling imbalanced data sets","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122008-00164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071429S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4433643","isNumber":"4433644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433643","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4433644","articleId":"4433808","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4433812,"authors":[{"name":"George Economakos","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National and Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Economakos","id":"37373878200"},{"name":"Christoforos Economakos","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Halkis Institute of Technology, Psachna, Greece"],"firstName":"Christoforos","lastName":"Economakos","id":"37298924100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1281-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1282-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4433812","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A run-time reconfigurable fuzzy PID controller based on modern FPGA devices","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Mediterranean Conference on Control & Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433643/4433644/04433812.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2007 Mediterranean Conference on Control & Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MED.2007.4433812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4433644","doi":"10.1109/MED.2007.4433812","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Runtime","Fuzzy control","Three-term control","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Microprocessors","Software maintenance","Software performance","Programmable logic arrays","Logic devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","fuzzy control","reconfigurable architectures","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA device","embedded run-time reconflgurable architecture","fuzzy logic PID controller design"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4433812","abstract":"Recent advances in device densities and the requirement for short time-to-market has made FPGA devices very popular for the implementation of general purpose electronic devices.

Such a feature can be beneficial for modern control applications, that may require the change of coefficients, models and control laws with respect to external conditions.

In this paper, FPGA reconfigurable hardware digital neural network architecture is presented and utilized to replace the Kalman Filter in the integration of MEMS IMU inertial sensors signals and the Magneto resistive sensors.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Micromechanical devices","Sensor systems","Neural networks","Intelligent sensors","Navigation","Intelligent networks","Intelligent vehicles","Neural network hardware","Magnetic separation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["attitude control","field programmable gate arrays","neural nets","reconfigurable architectures","remotely operated vehicles","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heading reference system","autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle","MEMS sensor","attitude estimation","real-time intelligent attitude","intelligent digital neural network software","Kalman filter","multisensor data fusion","FPGA reconfigurable hardware digital neural network architecture","inertial sensors signal","magneto resistive sensor","field programmable gate arrays","microelectromechanical system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4433822","doi":"10.1109/MED.2007.4433822","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Mediterranean Conference on Control & Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433643/4433644/04433822.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MED.2007.4433822","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4433644","publicationTitle":"2007 Mediterranean Conference on Control & Automation","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Attitude and heading refernce system I-AHRS for the EFIGENIA autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles UAV based on MEMS sensor and a neural network strategy for attitude estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Attitude and heading refernce system I-AHRS for the EFIGENIA autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles UAV based on MEMS sensor and a neural network strategy for attitude estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4433822/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2007","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4433822/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9825934","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Attitude and heading refernce system I-AHRS for the EFIGENIA autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles UAV based on MEMS sensor and a neural network strategy for attitude estimation","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122008-00178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051433S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4433643","isNumber":"4433644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433643","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4433644","articleId":"4433822","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4433871,"authors":[{"name":"Marcos E.

The methodology considers two autonomous modules, and assumes the existence of fault indicators (for monitoring purposes) and the availability of real-time measurements. A fault detection and identification (FDI) module uses a hybrid state-space model of the plant, and a particle filtering algorithm to calculate the probability of a crack in one of the blades of the turbine; simultaneously computing the state probability density function (pdf) estimates that will be used as initial conditions in the prognosis module. The failure prognosis module, on the other hand, computes the remaining useful life (RUL) pdf of the faulty subsystem in real-time, using a particle-filtering-based algorithm that consecutively updates the current state estimate for a nonlinear state-space model (with unknown time-varying parameters), and predicts the evolution in time of the probability distribution for the crack length. The outcome of the prognosis module provides information about precision and accuracy of long-term predictions, RUL expectations and 95% confidence intervals for the failure condition under study. Data from a seeded fault test is used to validate the proposed approaches.","doi":"10.1109/MED.2007.4433871","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Mediterranean Conference on Control & Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433643/4433644/04433871.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 Mediterranean Conference on Control & Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MED.2007.4433871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4433644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A particle filtering-based framework for real-time fault diagnosis and failure prognosis in a turbine engine","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Turbines","Engines","Fault detection","State estimation","Condition monitoring","Filtering algorithms","Blades","Probability density function","Distributed computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crack detection","engines","failure analysis","fault diagnosis","nonlinear control systems","particle filtering (numerical methods)","state estimation","state-space methods","statistical distributions","time-varying systems","turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time fault diagnosis","failure prognosis","turbine engine","online particle filtering","fault detection","fault identification","state estimation","nonlinear state-space model","time-varying parameter","probability distribution","crack length"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle filtering","fault detection","failure","prognosis","turbine engine"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4433871/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"A particle filtering-based framework for real-time fault diagnosis and failure prognosis in a turbine engine","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4433871/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9826099","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A particle filtering-based framework for real-time fault diagnosis and failure prognosis in a turbine engine","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"SPI-01122008-00227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054878S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4433643","isNumber":"4433644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433643","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"4433644","articleId":"4433871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4433877,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

In this paper, we propose a stereoscopic video generation method using motion analysis which converts motion into disparity values and considers multi-user conditions and the characteristics of the display device. The field of view and the maximum and minimum disparity values were calculated in the stereoscopic display characterization stage and were then applied to various types of 3D displays. After motion estimation, we used three cues to decide the scale factor of motion-to-disparity conversion. These cues were the magnitude of motion, camera movements and scene complexity. A subjective evaluation showed that the proposed method generated more satisfactory video sequence.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2007.914714","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/4529251/04433977.pdf","startPage":"188","endPage":"197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2007.914714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4529251","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4433977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Stereoscopic Video Generation Method Using Stereoscopic Display Characterization and Motion Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Stereoscopic Video Generation Method Using Stereoscopic Display Characterization and Motion Analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4433977/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","volume":"54","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4433977/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10002864","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Stereoscopic Video Generation Method Using Stereoscopic Display Characterization and Motion Analysis","sourcePdf":"54tbc02-kim2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058188S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"4529251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4529251","articleId":"4433977","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":4433985,"authors":[{"name":"Chul Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chul","lastName":"Lee","id":"37292811000"},{"name":"Sung Hoon Baek","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung Hoon","lastName":"Baek","id":"37651998500"},{"name":"Kyu Ho Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyu Ho","lastName":"Park","id":"37281165700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"4433985","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":1434},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","file organisation","flash memories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid flash file system","NAND flash memory","NOR flash memory","RAM buffer","embedded device","page-aligned fashion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Storage Management","File Systems Management","Real-time systems and embedded systems"]},{"kwd":["Storage Management","File Systems Management","Real-time systems and embedded systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4433985","abstract":"This paper presents a hybrid flash file system (HFFS) based on both NOR flash and NAND flash memory. In a conventional NAND flash-based flash file system, there is a trade-off between life span and durability in the frequent writing of small amounts of data. Because NAND flash supports only a page-level I/O, at least one page is wasted in the synchronous writing of small amounts of data. The wasting of pages reduces the utilization and life span of the NAND flash. To alleviate the utilization problem, some NAND flash-based flash file systems write small amounts of data asynchronously with RAM buffers, though buffering in RAM decreases the durability of the system. Our HFFS eliminates the trade-off between life span and durability. It synchronously stores data as a log in the NOR flash, whenever we append small amounts of data to a file. The merged logs are then flushed to the NAND flash in a page-aligned fashion. The implementation of our HFFS is based on our previous NAND flash-based file system, called CFFS, The experimental results reveal that our HFFS provides a longer life span than a conventional NAND flash-based synchronous flash file system with a similar level of durability.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"1002","endPage":"1008","doi":"10.1109/TC.2008.14","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2008.14","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4531171/04433985.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4531171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Flash File System Based on NOR and NAND Flash Memories for Embedded Devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4433985/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Flash File System Based on NOR and NAND Flash Memories for Embedded Devices","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 May 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10196173","volume":"57","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4433985/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Flash File System Based on NOR and NAND Flash Memories for Embedded Devices","sourcePdf":"ttc2008071002.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03895S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"4531171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4531171","articleId":"4433985","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4433987,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Xiong","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Alcatel-Lucent, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/4531171/4433987/4433987-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ming Xiong received the PhD degree in computer science from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in 2000.

Period and deadline assignment has been the main focus of past studies, such as the More-Less scheme [25], in which update transactions are guaranteed by the Deadline Monotonic scheduling algorithm [16] to complete by their deadlines. In this paper, we propose a deferrable scheduling algorithm for fixed-priority transactions, a novel approach for minimizing update workload while maintaining the temporal validity of real-time data. In contrast to prior work on maintaining data freshness periodically, update transactions follow an aperiodic task model in the deferrable scheduling algorithm. The deferrable scheduling algorithm exploits the semantics of temporal validity constraint of real-time data by judiciously deferring the sampling times of update transaction jobs as late as possible. We present a theoretical estimation of its processor utilization and a sufficient condition for its schedulability. Our experimental results verify the theoretical estimation of the processor utilization. We demonstrate through the experiments that the deferrable scheduling algorithm is an effective approach and it significantly outperforms the More-Less scheme in terms of reducing processor workload.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4531171/04433987.pdf","startPage":"952","endPage":"964","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.2008.16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2008.16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4531171","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4433987","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deferrable Scheduling for Maintaining Real-Time Data Freshness: Algorithms, Analysis, and Results","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real-time systems","Time factors","Scheduling algorithms","Data integrity","Task analysis","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["database management systems","processor scheduling","real-time systems","transaction processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time data freshness","periodic update transaction model","period assignment","deadline assignment","deadline monotonic scheduling algorithm","fixed-priority transactions","aperiodic task model","deferrable scheduling algorithm","temporal validity constraint","processor utilization","sufficient condition","schedulability","More-Less scheme","processor workload"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Real-time systems and embedded systems","Scheduling","Real-time and embedded systems"]},{"kwd":["Real-time systems and embedded systems","Scheduling","Real-time and embedded systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4433987/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Deferrable Scheduling for Maintaining Real-Time Data Freshness: Algorithms, Analysis, and Results","volume":"57","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4433987/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10196169","dateOfInsertion":"28 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deferrable Scheduling for Maintaining Real-Time Data Freshness: Algorithms, Analysis, and Results","sourcePdf":"ttc2008070952.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122799S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"4531171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4531171","articleId":"4433987","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4433990,"authors":[{"name":"Yaniv Frishman","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technion, Israel Institute of Technology-Technion, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2945/4530415/4433990/4433990-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yaniv Frishman received the BSc degree (summa cum laude) in computer engineering and the master's degree from the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel, in 1997 and 2006, respectively.

The method applies the minimum entropy control scheme to decrease the closed loop randomness of the output in an iterative learning control (ILC) basis. Both modeling and control of the plant are performed using dynamic neural networks. For this purpose, the whole control horizon is divided into a certain number of time domain sub-intervals called Batches and a P-type ILC law is employed to train the model and controller parameters so that the closed-loop tracking error is decreased batch-by- batch. The method has the advantage of decreasing the output uncertainty versus the advances of batches along the time horizon. The analysis on the proposed ILC convergence is made and demonstrable simulation results are also provided to show the effectiveness of the obtained control algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2007.4434090","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433999/4434000/04434090.pdf","startPage":"252","endPage":"257","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","publicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2007.4434090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4434000","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ILC-based adaptive minimum entropy control for general stochastic systems using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4434090/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"ILC-based adaptive minimum entropy control for general stochastic systems using neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9885188","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4434090/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ILC-based adaptive minimum entropy control for general stochastic systems using neural networks","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082008-00090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074761S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4433999","isNumber":"4434000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433999","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4434000","articleId":"4434090","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4434114,"authors":[{"name":"Leonid Mirkin","affiliation":["Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Leonid","lastName":"Mirkin","id":"37300879100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1497-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1498-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"4434114","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"abstract":"This paper revises the so-called input delay approach to the control of sampled-data systems with nonuniform sampling, in which the sample-and-hold circuit is embedded into an analog system with a time-varying input delay.

In this paper, a convex noise set is defined in the time domain using decorrelation between the noise and the system input. For infinite data length, we prove that the estimate of the infinity norm converges to its true value. A simulation example shows the behavior for finite data length.

The repetitive part of this controller allows us to target specific periodic disturbances visible in the disturbance spectrum. The adaptive part is intended to cancel the inter-notch stochastic disturbances. The key element in this design is the formulation of an appropriate optimization problem, solvable recursively by the use of some of the available adaptive-filtering algorithms.

The neural network scheme is posed so that the nonlinear disturbance model for a measurable disturbance can be adapted for rejection of the disturbance affecting a closed loop system. The non-linear neural network approach has been particularly developed for 'mobile' applications where the adaptation algorithm has to remain simple. For that reason, the theoretical framework justifies a very simple least-mean-square approach suggested in a mobile hard disk drive context. This approach is generalized to a non-linear adaptive neural network compensation scheme. In addition, usual assumptions are relaxed, so that it is sufficient to model the nonlinear disturbance model as a stable system avoiding strictly positive real assumptions. The output of the estimated disturbance model is assumed to be matched to the compensation signal for effectiveness, although for stability this is not necessary. Simulation examples show different features of the adaptation algorithm also considering a realistic hard disk drive simulation.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2007.4434253","startPage":"5965","endPage":"5972","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433999/4434000/04434253.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2007.4434253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4434000","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Disturbance compensation for servo-control applications using a discrete adaptive neural network feedforward method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servosystems","Adaptive systems","Neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Hard disks","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Engines","Adaptive control","Control systems","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","compensation","disc drives","discrete systems","feedforward","hard discs","least mean squares methods","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","servomotors","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["disturbance compensation","servo-control applications","discrete adaptive neural network feedforward method","closed loop system","nonlinear disturbance model","least-mean-square approach","mobile hard disk drive context","stability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4434253/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Disturbance compensation for servo-control applications using a discrete adaptive neural network feedforward method","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4434253/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9885351","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Disturbance compensation for servo-control applications using a discrete adaptive neural network feedforward method","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082008-00253.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109338S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4433999","isNumber":"4434000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433999","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4434000","articleId":"4434253","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4434263,"authors":[{"name":"Shinkichi Inagaki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan"],"lastName":"Shinkichi Inagaki","id":"37302232800"},{"name":"Tatsuya Suzuki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan"],"lastName":"Tatsuya Suzuki","id":"37276136600"},{"name":"Mitsuo Saito","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan"],"lastName":"Mitsuo Saito","id":"37830545100"},{"name":"Takeshi Aoki","affiliation":["Nagoya Municipal Industrial Research Institute, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan"],"lastName":"Takeshi Aoki","id":"37349982800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1497-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1498-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"4434263","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"abstract":"This paper presents a new local/global fault diagnosis strategy for the event-driven controlled systems such as the programmable logic controller (PLC).

Second, the local diagnoser is developed using the conventional timed Markov model (TMM), and the local diagnosis results are used to specify the conditional probability assigned to each arc in the BN. By exploiting the local/global diagnosis architecture, the computational burden for the diagnosis can be drastically reduced. As the result, large scale diagnosis problems in the practical situation can be solved.

Our technical approach is based on the theory of unknown input observability. First, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the misbehavior to be observable and for the identity of the faulty node to be detectable. Second, we design a distributed unknown input estimator, and we characterize its convergence rate in the \"equal-neighbor\" model and in the general case.

The modified DKF algorithm uses two identical consensus filters for fusion of the sensor data and covariance information and is applicable to sensor networks with different observation matrices. This enables the sensor network to act as a collective observer for the processes occurring in an environment. Then, we introduce a continuous-time distributed Kalman filter that uses local aggregation of the sensor data but attempts to reach a consensus on estimates with other nodes in the network. This peer-to-peer distributed estimation method gives rise to two iterative distributed Kalman filtering algorithms with different consensus strategies on estimates. Communication complexity and packet-loss issues are discussed.

The stage has a low degree of freedom monolithic parallel kinematic mechanism using flexure hinges. It is driven by piezoelectric actuators and its displacement is detected by capacitance gauges. The design has strongly coupled dynamics with each actuator input producing in multi- axis motions. The nano-positioner is modeled as a multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) system, and the MIMO plant model is identified by time-domain identification methods. The design of the nano-positioner relies heavily on the control design to account for the high coupling in the system. The proposed H\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">infin</sub>\n MIMO controller achieves a good performance in terms of resolution, bandwidth and robustness to the modeling uncertainty. In the second part of the paper, we present control design for tasks that require repetitive motion of nano positioning system. These tasks are quite common in micro/nano manipulation and manufacturing. This paper presents a robust control design that gives a significant (over thirty fold) improvement in tracking of repetitive motions on a prespecified frequency band. This design, unlike other schemes, is robust to modeling uncertainties that arise in flexure based mechanisms, and does not require any learning steps during its real time implementation. This design scheme is implemented on a parallel-kinematics XYZ nano positioning stage for repetitive nano-manipulation and nano-manufacturing applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433999/4434000/04434317.pdf","startPage":"4495","endPage":"4500","publicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2007.4434317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2007.4434317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4434000","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4434317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust MIMO control of a parallel kinematics nano-positioner for high resolution high bandwidth tracking and repetitive tasks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","MIMO","Kinematics","Nanopositioning","Bandwidth","Control design","Tracking","Uncertainty","Trajectory","Fasteners"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","Hinfin control","industrial robots","manipulator kinematics","micromanipulators","MIMO systems","motion control","nanopositioning","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hinfin controller","robust MIMO control","parallel kinematics nanopositioner","high resolution high bandwidth tracking repetitive task","robust control design","reference trajectory tracking","repetitive motion","monolithic parallel kinematic mechanism","flexure hinges","piezoelectric actuators","capacitance gauge","multiaxis motion","multiple input multiple output system","time-domain identification","micromanipulation","uncertainty modeling","repetitive nanomanipulation","repetitive nanomanufacturing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4434317/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Robust MIMO control of a parallel kinematics nano-positioner for high resolution high bandwidth tracking and repetitive tasks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4434317/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9885415","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust MIMO control of a parallel kinematics nano-positioner for high resolution high bandwidth tracking and repetitive tasks","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082008-00317.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082832S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4433999","isNumber":"4434000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433999","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4434000","articleId":"4434317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4434334,"authors":[{"name":"Changhee Joo","affiliation":["Ohio State Uinversity, USA"],"lastName":"Changhee Joo","id":"37278532800"},{"name":"Xiaojun Lin","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaojun Lin","id":"37274731700"},{"name":"Ness B.

For simplicity, we focus on the well-established node-exclusive interference model, although many of the stated results can be readily extended to more general interference models. The study of the performance of GMM is intriguing because although a lower bound on its performance is well known, empirical observations suggest that this bound is quite loose, and that the performance of GMM is often close to optimal. In fact, recent results have shown that GMM achieves optimal performance under certain conditions. In this paper, we provide new analytic results that characterize the performance of GMM through the topological properties of the underlying graphs. To that end, we generalize a recently developed topological notion called the local pooling condition to a far weaker condition called the sigma-local pooling. We then define the local-pooling factor on a graph, as the supremum of all sigma such that the graph satisfies sigma-local pooling. We show that for a given graph, the efficiency ratio of GMM (i.e., the worst-case ratio of the throughput of GMM to that of the optimal) is equal to its local-pooling factor. Further, we provide results on how to estimate the local-pooling factor for arbitrary graphs and show that the efficiency ratio of GMM is no smaller than d*/(2d*-1) in a network topology of maximum node-degree d*. We also identify a specific network topology for which the efficiency ratio of GMM is strictly less than 1.","publicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433999/4434000/04434334.pdf","startPage":"1128","endPage":"1133","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2007.4434334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2007.4434334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4434000","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance limits of greedy maximal matching in multi-hop wireless networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4434334/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Performance limits of greedy maximal matching in multi-hop wireless networks","htmlLink":"/document/4434334/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9885432","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance limits of greedy maximal matching in multi-hop wireless networks","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082008-00334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082773S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4433999","isNumber":"4434000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433999","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4434000","articleId":"4434334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4434344,"authors":[{"name":"Josef Hofbauer","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Josef","lastName":"Hofbauer","id":"37827812600"},{"name":"William H.

Stable games subsume many well-known classes of examples, including zero-sum games, games with an interior ESS, wars of attrition, and concave potential games. We prove that the set of Nash equilibria of any stable game is convex.

The longitudinal velocity of the car is a measurable external signal and cannot be influenced by the controller. Using an on-line time-scaling, which is driven by the longitudinal velocity of the car, by a time-scaling output of the tracking controller, and by their time derivatives up to the second order, one can achieve exponential tracking of any sufficiently smooth reference trajectory with non-vanishing velocity, similar to the two-input differentially flat model of the kinematic car. The time derivatives of the longitudinal velocity and the time-scaling output are no longer necessary if one designs the tracking controller for the linearized error dynamics around the reference path.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4434000","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2007.4434463","publicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433999/4434000/04434463.pdf","startPage":"1969","endPage":"1974","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2007.4434463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking control of the orbitally flat kinematic car with a new time-scaling input","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Tracking control of the orbitally flat kinematic car with a new time-scaling input","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4434463/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9885561","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4434463/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking control of the orbitally flat kinematic car with a new time-scaling input","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082008-00463.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076859S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4433999","isNumber":"4434000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433999","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4434000","articleId":"4434463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4434478,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.

The design supports predefined levels of performance robustness in the presence of channel uncertainty and signal interference. A novel stability boundary is introduced based on the use of the Jury array that informs the necessary trade-off between disturbance attenuation and system stability. Extensive simulation results are provided that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust power control for CDMA cellular communication networks using quantitative feedback theory","publicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2007.4434478","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433999/4434000/04434478.pdf","startPage":"5080","endPage":"5085","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2007.4434478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4434000","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4434478","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4434478/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Robust power control for CDMA cellular communication networks using quantitative feedback theory","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4434478/","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9885576","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust power control for CDMA cellular communication networks using quantitative feedback theory","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082008-00478.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092862S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4433999","isNumber":"4434000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433999","xplore-issue":"4434000","articleId":"4434478","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4434535,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The inversion-based feedforward control techniques have been successfully implemented in various applications. Usually the inverse feedforward input is applied by augmenting it with a feedback controller\u2014to account for adverse effects such as dynamics variations and disturbances. However, currently such an integration, of the feedback control to the inversion-based feedforward control, is ad-hoc, and may not lead to an optimal complementation of the feedback control with the inversion-based feedforward control. The contribution of this article is a systematic development of designing the inversion-based feedforward-feedback 2DOF controller. First, a novel robust system-inversion method is proposed which achieves a guaranteed tracking performance of the feedforward control for bounded dynamics uncertainties. Secondly, the bound of the tracking error of the feedforward control is utilized in the H\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u221e</sup>\n robust control framework to design the feedback controller which complements the feedforward control. Based on the concept of Bode\u2019s integral, it is shown that the feedback bandwidth can be improved from that by using feedback alone, with no loss of tracking precision and robustness stability.

In this paper we consider ARQ protocols where the transmitter controls the amount of error correction capability introduced in the information sequence to minimize the expected delay. We formulate this problem as a stochastic control problem and study two cases of interest depending on whether or not the receiver feeds back information about the channel state. Some of the benefits of this formulation are an expression for the optimal packet size and delay as a solution of a fixed point equation and a unified treatment for channels with Markov statistics and for receivers with memory.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Automatic repeat request","Protocols","Transmitters","Decoding","Data communication","Feedback","Error correction","Stochastic processes","Feeds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","data communication","decoding","encoding","error correction","Markov processes","receivers","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay-optimal ARQ protocol","automatic repeat request","data transmission","feedback channel","error correction","stochastic control problem","optimal packet size","Markov statistics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4434547","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2007.4434547","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433999/4434000/04434547.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2007.4434547","startPage":"5204","endPage":"5209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4434000","publicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay-optimal ARQ protocol design for channels with memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Delay-optimal ARQ protocol design for channels with memory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4434547/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4434547/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9885645","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay-optimal ARQ protocol design for channels with memory","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082008-00547.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0753S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4433999","isNumber":"4434000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433999","xplore-issue":"4434000","articleId":"4434547","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4434561,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We propose a technique based on structured adaptability, and some recent sampling techniques, that results in sample complexity that is polynomial in the number of stages. Thus we circumvent a difficulty that has traditionally plagued sample-based approaches for multi-stage formulations. This allows us to provide a hierarchy of adaptability schemes, not only for continuous problems, but also for discrete problems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Uncertainty","Stochastic processes","Uncertain systems","Robustness","USA Councils","Constraint optimization","Polynomials","Design optimization","Information analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling methods","stochastic programming","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic programming","multi-stage optimization formulations","sampling techniques","adaptability schemes","parameter uncertainty"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CDC.2007.4434596","publicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433999/4434000/04434596.pdf","startPage":"4717","endPage":"4722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4434000","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2007.4434596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptability via sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4434596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptability via sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4434596/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4434596/","accessionNumber":"9885694","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptability via sampling","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082008-00596.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052137S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4433999","isNumber":"4434000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433999","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4434000","articleId":"4434596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4434619,"authors":[{"name":"Yassine Ariba","affiliation":["LAAS-CNRS, University of Toulouse III, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Yassine","lastName":"Ariba","id":"37593406600"},{"name":"Frederic Gouaisbaut","affiliation":["LAAS-CNRS, University of Toulouse III, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Frederic","lastName":"Gouaisbaut","id":"37299734300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1497-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1498-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"4434619","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":367},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4434619","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay-dependent stability analysis of linear systems with time-varying delay","abstract":"Stability analysis of linear systems with time- varying delay is investigated.

On the other hand, by setting an a priori positivity constraint to the processing algorithm could be a heavy restriction to its performances. It is worthwhile, then, to look for a state-space realization through combination of positive systems. In this paper a state-space representation for a class of MIMO systems is proposed in the discrete-time framework. The approach followed provides an easy implementation by means of combinations of positive systems, whose total order is fixed regardless of the poles location in the complex plane. The stability of the positive realization of a stable system is also investigated.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433999/4434000/04434623.pdf","startPage":"476","endPage":"481","publicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2007.4434623","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2007.4434623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4434000","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4434623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"State space representation of a class of MIMO Systems via positive systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["State-space methods","MIMO","Signal processing algorithms","Control systems","Process design","Signal design","Stability","Chebyshev approximation","USA Councils","Space technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO systems","state-space methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["state space representation","MIMO systems","positive systems","control law","signal processing","linear systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Positive systems","State-space realization","Linear systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4434623/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"State space representation of a class of MIMO Systems via positive systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4434623/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9885721","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"State space representation of a class of MIMO Systems via positive systems","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082008-00623.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058305S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4433999","isNumber":"4434000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433999","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4434000","articleId":"4434623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4434630,"authors":[{"name":"Minyi Huang","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, Carnegie Mellon University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Minyi Huang","id":"37273546900"},{"name":"Jonathan H.

Each agent constructs a local estimate based on its own measurements and estimates from its neighbors. Estimation is performed via a two stage strategy, the first being a Kalman-like measurement update which does not require communication, and the second being an estimate fusion using a consensus matrix. In particular we study the interaction between the consensus matrix, the number of messages exchanged per sampling time, and the Kalman gain. We prove that optimizing the consensus matrix for fastest convergence and using the centralized optimal gain is not necessarily the optimal strategy if the number of message exchange per sampling time is small. Moreover, we prove that under certain conditions the optimal consensus matrix should be doubly stochastic. We also provide some numerical examples to clarify some of the analytical results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Kalman filtering using consensus strategies","publicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2007.4434667","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433999/4434000/04434667.pdf","startPage":"5486","endPage":"5491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2007.4434667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4434000","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4434667","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4434667/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Kalman filtering using consensus strategies","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4434667/","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9885765","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Kalman filtering using consensus strategies","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082008-00667.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067748S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4433999","isNumber":"4434000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433999","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4434000","articleId":"4434667","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4434674,"authors":[{"name":"Rouzbeh Touri","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Rouzbeh","lastName":"Touri","id":"37827719800"},{"name":"Petros G.

Specifically, the system model consists of a wireless transmitter with data packets arriving to its queue having strict deadline constraints. The transmitter can control the transmission rate over time and the expended power depends on both the chosen rate and the present channel state. The objective is to obtain a rate-control policy that serves the data to meet the deadline constraints while also minimizing the transmission energy expenditure. Using a novel approach based on cumulative curves methodology and continuous-time stochastic control formulation, we obtain the optimal transmission policy under various specific scenarios. Utilizing these results, we then present an energy-efficient policy for the case of arbitrary packet arrivals and deadline constraints, and also give simulation results comparing its performance with a non-adaptive scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum energy transmission over a wireless fading channel with packet deadlines","publicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2007.4434683","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433999/4434000/04434683.pdf","startPage":"1148","endPage":"1155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2007.4434683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4434000","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4434683","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4434683/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Minimum energy transmission over a wireless fading channel with packet deadlines","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4434683/","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9885781","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum energy transmission over a wireless fading channel with packet deadlines","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082008-00683.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043609S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","isNumber":"4434000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433999","citationCount":"15","articleId":"4434683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4434693,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Motivated by [2], simplifying assumptions from previous works on this subject are avoided and a complete stability analysis is provided. Graph theory is used to model the inter-vehicle communication, and the proposed coordination controller respects the topological constraints of the communication network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4434733/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4434733/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9885831","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","displayDocTitle":"Straight line path following for formations of underactuated underwater vehicles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Straight line path following for formations of underactuated underwater vehicles","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082008-00733.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058428S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4433999","isNumber":"4434000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433999","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4434000","articleId":"4434733","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4434786,"authors":[{"name":"Mario Alberto Jordan","affiliation":["The Argentinean Institute of Oceanography Department of Electrical Engineering and Computers, Universidad Nacional del Sur, Bahia Blanca, Argentina"],"firstName":"Mario Alberto","lastName":"Jordan","id":"37343695100"},{"name":"Jorge Luis Bustamante","affiliation":["The Argentinean Institute of Oceanography Department of Electrical Engineering and Computers, Universidad Nacional del Sur, Bahia Blanca, Argentina"],"firstName":"Jorge Luis","lastName":"Bustamante","id":"37296935700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1497-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1498-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"4434786","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4434786","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive control","Remotely operated vehicles","Sampling methods","Underwater cables","Underwater vehicles","Vehicle dynamics","Automatic control","Optimal control","Control systems","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","gradient methods","path planning","remotely operated vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct adaptive control","guide system","3D path tracking","ROV","speed-gradient algorithm","optimal-time path following algorithm","discrete sampling","remotely operated vehicles"]}],"abstract":"An approach to direct adaptive control and a fast guide system design for 3D path tracking for full actuated ROVs is presented. This combines a speed-gradient algorithm with and optimal-time path following algorithm. The work is oriented to applications of systematic sampling missions on the sea bottom. Here, the perturbed case is treated, in where several disturbances like flow, cable tugs and stepwise mass-variation are assumed acting on the vehicle. The algorithm for optimal- time path tracking is based on the generation of a virtual time that works as independent variable in any smooth geometric reference path, which is previously specified. So, the rate of the virtual time is maximized according to a state-dependent law that pushes the set of thrusts to the limits of saturation without crossing them. A suitable tactics for discrete sampling is developed and simulated together with the proposed adaptive approach.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4434000","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2007.4434786","publicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433999/4434000/04434786.pdf","startPage":"1300","endPage":"1305","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2007.4434786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive control system for perturbed ROVs in discrete sampling missions with optimal-time characteristics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive control system for perturbed ROVs in discrete sampling missions with optimal-time characteristics","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4434786/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9885884","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4434786/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive control system for perturbed ROVs in discrete sampling missions with optimal-time characteristics","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082008-00786.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04499S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4433999","isNumber":"4434000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433999","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4434000","articleId":"4434786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":4434811,"authors":[{"name":"Travis Dierks","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Missouri, Rolla, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Travis","lastName":"Dierks","id":"37546896900"},{"name":"S.

However the design and analysis of CSMA schedulers for general networks has been an open problem due to the complexity of the interaction among coupled interference constraints. For networks with primary interference constraints, we introduce a tractable analysis of such CSMA schedulers based on a fixed point approximation.

We establish approach of the solution to an interval around the optimum value. We illustrate the algorithm's performance, in terms of convergence rate and communication cost relative to alternative schemes, through several numerical examples.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple peer-to-peer algorithm for distributed optimization in sensor networks","publicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2007.4434888","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433999/4434000/04434888.pdf","startPage":"4705","endPage":"4710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2007.4434888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4434000","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4434888","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4434888/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A simple peer-to-peer algorithm for distributed optimization in sensor networks","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4434888/","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9885986","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple peer-to-peer algorithm for distributed optimization in sensor networks","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082008-00888.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042062S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4433999","isNumber":"4434000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433999","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4434000","articleId":"4434888","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4434891,"authors":[{"name":"Aaron D.

In analogy to the standard procedure of linearizing a vector field at an equilibrium point to determine its stability, in this paper we study the local behavior of a hybrid system near a Zeno equilibrium point by considering the value of the vector field on each domain at this point, i.e., we consider constant approximations of nonlinear hybrid systems. By means of these constant approximations, we are able to derive conditions that simultaneously imply both the existence of Zeno behavior and the local exponential stability of a Zeno equilibrium point. Moreover, since these conditions are in terms of the value of the vector field on each domain at a point, they are remarkably easy to verify.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2007.4434891","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433999/4434000/04434891.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2007.4434891","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4434000","publicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","startPage":"4033","endPage":"4038","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Sufficient conditions for the existence of zeno behavior in a class of nonlinear hybrid systems via constant approximations","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4434891/","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9885989","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4434891/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sufficient conditions for the existence of zeno behavior in a class of nonlinear hybrid systems via constant approximations","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082008-00891.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069257S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4433999","isNumber":"4434000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433999","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4434000","articleId":"4434891","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4434916,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Wolff","affiliation":["Institute of Automatic Control Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Wolff","id":"37838652500"},{"name":"Carolina Weber","affiliation":["Institute of Automatic Control Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Carolina","lastName":"Weber","id":"37529446500"},{"name":"Martin Buss","affiliation":["Institute of Automatic Control Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Buss","id":"37274070400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1497-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1498-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"4434916","dbTime":"68 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"abstract":"Invariance control addresses the problem of control of nonlinear affine systems in the presence of state constraints. Admissibility is guaranteed by keeping an admissible subset of state space positively invariant by switching of the control on the boundary of the set. A modification of the invariance controller is proposed that replaces the switching between the invariance control modes with a continuous transition. As a result, robustness with respect to parameter perturbations and disturbances increases. The effectiveness of the approach is validated by numerical simulation of an example system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433999/4434000/04434916.pdf","startPage":"542","endPage":"547","publicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2007.4434916","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2007.4434916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4434000","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4434916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous control mode transitions for invariance control of constrained nonlinear systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Nonlinear systems","Optimal control","State-space methods","Numerical simulation","Control system synthesis","Predictive models","Predictive control","State feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["invariance","nonlinear control systems","perturbation techniques","state-space methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constrained nonlinear affine systems","continuous control mode transition","invariance control","state space method","parameter perturbation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4434916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Continuous control mode transitions for invariance control of constrained nonlinear systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4434916/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9886014","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous control mode transitions for invariance control of constrained nonlinear systems","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082008-00916.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042502S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4433999","isNumber":"4434000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433999","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4434000","articleId":"4434916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4434945,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Our inspiration is derived from the observation that many ant species use landmark retinal positions to navigate without having any range information.

We present a provably correct bearing-only navigation controller and a methodology for tracking that lends itself to control of formations.

This result is useful for implementing vehicle formation control because it provides a guideline for the proper intervehicle spacing. In the heterogeneous case, the differing dynamics of the vehicles means the spacing errors do not attenuate or amplify uniformly down the vehicle chain, regardless of whether the formation is string stable or not. Results from heterogeneous string stability analysis are presented and used to construct a controller design procedure that gives string stability and robustness to external disturbances for heterogeneous vehicle strings. The proper intervehicle spacing needed for nominal safety is determined. The resulting controller is simulated to demonstrate its effectiveness. It is shown that string stability can be achieved for heterogeneous vehicle strings of arbitrary length and arbitrary vehicle type ordering.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4435011/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9886109","htmlLink":"/document/4435011/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Controller design for string stable heterogeneous vehicle strings","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Controller design for string stable heterogeneous vehicle strings","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082008-01011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058583S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4433999","isNumber":"4434000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433999","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4434000","articleId":"4435011","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4435012,"authors":[{"name":"H.A.

The proposed FDI scheme employs a neural network-based observer for detecting and identifying the severity of actuator gain faults in the presence of disturbances and uncertainties in the model and sensory measurements. The neural network weights are updated based on a modified dynamic backpropagation scheme. The proposed FDI scheme does not rely on the availability of full state measurements. In most work in the literature, the fault function acts as an additive (bias) term, whereas in our scheme the fault function acts as a multiplicative (gain) term. This representation makes the stability analysis of the overall FDI scheme rather challenging. Stability properties of the proposed fault detection scheme in the presence of unknown actuator gain faults as well as plant and sensor uncertainties are demonstrated by using Lyapunov's direct method with no restrictive assumptions on the system and/or the FDI algorithm. The performance of our proposed FDI approach is evaluated through simulations performed on a reaction wheel type actuator that is commonly employed in the attitude control subsystem (ACS) of a satellite.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2007.4435012","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433999/4434000/04435012.pdf","startPage":"2614","endPage":"2619","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","publicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2007.4435012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4434000","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network-based actuator gain Fault Detection and Isolation strategy for nonlinear systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4435012/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A neural network-based actuator gain Fault Detection and Isolation strategy for nonlinear systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9886110","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4435012/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network-based actuator gain Fault Detection and Isolation strategy for nonlinear systems","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082008-01012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055952S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4433999","isNumber":"4434000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433999","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4434000","articleId":"4435012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4435015,"authors":[{"name":"Lijun Chen","affiliation":["Engineering & Applied Science Division, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Lijun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37292789300"},{"name":"Steven H.

This provides a general analytical framework that is capable of modelling a large class of systemwide quality of service models via the specification of per-node utility functions, in which systemwide fairness or service differentiation can be achieved in a distributed manner as long as each node executes a contention resolution algorithm that is designed to achieve the Nash equilibrium. We thus design medium access method according to distributed strategy update mechanism achieving the Nash equilibrium of random access game. In addition to guiding medium access control design, the random access game model also provides an analytical framework to understand equilibrium and dynamic properties of different medium access protocols and their interactions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4433999/4434000/04435015.pdf","startPage":"3428","endPage":"3434","publicationTitle":"2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2007.4435015","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2007.4435015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4434000","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4435015","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contention control: A game-theoretic approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nash equilibrium","Media Access Protocol","USA Councils","Wireless networks","Distributed algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Quality of service","Design methodology","Heuristic algorithms","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","game theory","quality of service","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["contention control","game-theoretic approach","random access game","wireless nodes","wireless networks","contention-based medium access","Nash equilibria","quality of service","per-node utility functions","service differentiation","contention resolution algorithm","medium access control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4435015/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Contention control: A game-theoretic approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4435015/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9886113","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contention control: A game-theoretic approach","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082008-01015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063234S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4433999","isNumber":"4434000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4433999","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4434000","articleId":"4435015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4435035,"authors":[{"name":"Alfredo Germani","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica e dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi dell'' Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy"],"firstName":"Alfredo","lastName":"Germani","id":"37274965300"},{"name":"Costanzo Manes","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica e dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi dell'' Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy"],"firstName":"Costanzo","lastName":"Manes","id":"37274963500"},{"name":"Pasquale Palumbo","affiliation":["Istituto di Analisi ed Informatica A.

This novel technique can greatly reduce the cost of a phased-array system and will enable the wide-scale deployment of phased arrays in low-end commercial products. In the presented three-element phased array, the center (driven) antenna is fed by an RF source and the two neighboring (passive) antennas are excited through the mutual coupling from the center antenna. The phase shifts between the antenna elements are achieved by changing the reactance of the capacitors loading the two passive antennas. A phased array using this novel technique is designed, fabricated, and measured at 3 GHz with a bandwidth of 1.8%. This phased array is shown to be able to steer the antenna beam from 20 to 20 degrees in an analog fashion. The measured radiation patterns of this phased array closely match the theoretical calculation and full-wave simulation results.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2008.916689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4446029","startPage":"81","endPage":"84","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/4446029/04435062.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low-Cost Patch Antenna Phased Array With Analog Beam Steering Using Mutual Coupling and Reactive Loading","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4435062/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4435062/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Low-Cost Patch Antenna Phased Array With Analog Beam Steering Using Mutual Coupling and Reactive Loading","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2008","accessionNumber":"9921126","dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-Cost Patch Antenna Phased Array With Analog Beam Steering Using Mutual Coupling and Reactive Loading","sourcePdf":"07lawp01-yusuf.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104037S","chronDate":"2008","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"4446029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"4446029","articleId":"4435062","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4435069,"authors":[{"name":"Niksa Tadic","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Measurements and Circuit Design, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4539047/4435069/4435069-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Niks\u02d8a Tadic (A'95\u2013M'01) was born on March 27, 1966.

According to the IEEE 802.15 WPAN low rate alternative PHY Task Group 4a, UWB will play a major role in localization applications, due to the high time resolution of UWB signals which allow accurate indirect measurements of distance between transceivers. Key for the successful implementation of UWB transceivers is the level of integration that will be reached, for which a simulation environment that helps take appropriate design decisions is crucial. Owing to this motivation, in this paper we propose a multiresolution UWB simulation environment based on the VHDL-AMS hardware description language, along with a proper methodology which helps tackle the complexity of designing a mixed-signal UWB system-on-chip. We applied the methodology and used the simulation environment for the specification and design of an UWB transceiver based on the energy detection principle. As a by-product, simulation results show the effectiveness of UWB in the so-called ranging application, that is the accurate evaluation of the distance between a couple of transceivers using the two-way-ranging method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4435073/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2008","accessionNumber":"10050661","htmlLink":"/document/4435073/","displayDocTitle":"A VHDL-AMS Simulation Environment for an UWB Impulse Radio Transceiver","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A VHDL-AMS Simulation Environment for an UWB Impulse Radio Transceiver","sourcePdf":"55tcsi05-casu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091309S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4539047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4539047","articleId":"4435073","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4435074,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Sheng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, Feng Chia University FCU, Taichung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4563499/4435074/4435074-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yi-Sheng Chen received the B.S. and the M.S. degrees, both in electrical engineering from the National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1997 and 1999, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and control engineering from the National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 2006.","He was with the military service from 1999 to 2001, and with the Kaohsiung Rapid Transmit Corporation from 2001 to 2002.

The method uses periodic precoding on the source signal before transmission. The estimation of the channel impulse response matrix consists of two steps: 1) obtain the channel product matrix by solving a lower-triangular linear system; 2) obtain the channel impulse response matrix by computing the positive eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a Hermitian matrix formed from the channel product matrix. The method is applicable to MIMO channels with more transmitters or more receivers. A sufficient condition for identifiability is simply that the channel impulse response matrix is full column rank. The design of the precoding sequence which minimizes the noise effect in covariance matrix estimation is proposed and the effect of the optimal precoding sequence on channel equalization is discussed.

The arriving temporally broad-band-bandpass ST PWs are received by a 1-D uniformly distributed sensor array. The sensor signals are pre-filtered, down-shifted to the intermediate frequency (IF) band, low-pass filtered and synchronously sampled by the real IF tri-stage temporal sampler array, resulting in a real-valued 2-D sampled sequence. The beamforming operation is then carried out on this 2-D sampled sequence using the real-coefficient 2-D FIR double-trapezoidal filter. Arithmetic complexity in the hardware implementation of the 2-D FIR double-trapezoidal filter is significantly reduced by using an array of real-coefficient polyphase 1-D FIR filters.

This work investigates 1) whether it is possible to decode dexterous finger movements using spatially-constrained volumes of neurons as typically recorded from a microelectrode array; and 2) whether decoding accuracy differs due to the configuration or location of the array within the M1 hand area. Single-unit activities were sequentially recorded from task-related neurons in two rhesus monkeys as they performed individuated movements of the fingers and the wrist. Simultaneous neuronal ensembles were simulated by constraining these activities to the recording field dimensions of conventional microelectrode array architectures. Artificial neural network (ANN) based filters were able to decode individuated finger movements with greater than 90% accuracy for the majority of movement types, using as few as 20 neurons from these ensemble activities. Furthermore, for the large majority of cases there were no significant differences (p < 0.01) in decoding accuracy as a function of the location of the recording volume. The results suggest that a brain-machine interface (BMI) for dexterous control of individuated fingers and the wrist can be implemented using microelectrode arrays placed broadly in the M1 hand area.","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2007.916269","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/4451151/04435078.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"23","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2007.916269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4451151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoding Individuated Finger Movements Using Volume-Constrained Neuronal Ensembles in the M1 Hand Area","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4435078","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4435078/","displayDocTitle":"Decoding Individuated Finger Movements Using Volume-Constrained Neuronal Ensembles in the M1 Hand Area","volume":"16","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9784092","pubMedId":"18303801","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4435078/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoding Individuated Finger Movements Using Volume-Constrained Neuronal Ensembles in the M1 Hand Area","sourcePdf":"16tnsre01-acharya.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.169969S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"4451151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"4451151","articleId":"4435078","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4435080,"authors":[{"name":"Cihun-Siyong Alex Gong","affiliation":["Biomedical and Communication SIC Laboratory Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4563499/4435080/4435080-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cihun-Siyong Alex Gong (S'05) was born in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1980.

In this study, a demodulator architecture capable of dealing with most of the previous limitations in an ASK-utilized medical implant, especially in want of being powered through wireless delivering, is proposed. It features the abilities of working on a very small modulation index and being provided without any R/C component(s) inside by means of a self-sampling scheme. The design has been implemented in an 18-mum CMOS process. The demodulator circuit occupies a die size of merely 32.3 times 14.5 mu m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n. Analytic results from both simulated gradation and fabricated chips show that the proposed circuit can operate at a carrier of 2 MHz and achieve a modulation rate of up to 50%. The results also demonstrate that the presented work can still perform a proper demodulation even with a modulation index beneath 5.5%. An average power of approximately 336 muW was confirmed in return for the remarkable advantages.

The principle of operation, theoretical analysis, and experimental results of one prototype rated 40W and operating at 94kHz are provided in this paper to verify the performance of this new family of converters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4435082/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","volume":"55","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9966168","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4435082/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Family of Single-Switch PWM Converters With High Step-Up Conversion Ratio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Family of Single-Switch PWM Converters With High Step-Up Conversion Ratio","sourcePdf":"55tcsi04-ismail.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083633S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4516005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"229","xplore-issue":"4516005","articleId":"4435082","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4435083,"authors":[{"name":"Mika Laiho","affiliation":["Helsinki University of Technology, Finland","Microelectronics Laboratory, University of Turku, Turku, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4509511/4435083/4435083-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mika Laiho (M'04) was born in Parkano, Finland, in 1973.

To circumvent CFO with I/Q mismatch, the proposed P-CFO algorithm rotates three training symbols by adding extra frequency offset into the received sequence to improve CFO estimation. Simulation results indicate that the estimation error of the proposed method is about 0.3 ppm, which is lower than those of two-repeat preamble-based methods.

The goal of this study was to investigate the feasibility of a portable preimpact fall detector in detecting impending falls before the body impacts on the ground. It was hypothesized that a single sensor with the appropriate kinematics measurements and detection algorithms, located near the body center of gravity, would be able to distinguish an in-progress and unrecoverable fall from nonfalling activities. The apparatus was tested in an array of daily nonfall activities of young (n = 10) and elderly (n = 14) subjects, and simulated fall activities of young subjects. A threshold detection method was used with the magnitude of inertial frame vertical velocity as the main variable to separate the nonfall and fall activities. The algorithm was able to detect all fall events at least 70 ms before the impact. With the threshold adapted to each individual subject, all falls were detected successfully, and no false alarms occurred. This portable preimpact fall detection apparatus will lead to the development of a new generation inflatable hip pad for preventing fall-related hip fractures.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/4483552/04435088.pdf","startPage":"178","endPage":"183","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2007.916282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2007.916282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4483552","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4435088","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Portable Preimpact Fall Detector With Inertial Sensors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Hip","Senior citizens","Kinematics","Protection","Detection algorithms","Gravity","Testing","Event detection","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomechanics","biomedical equipment","fracture","geriatrics","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["portable preimpact fall detector","inertial sensors","hip fractures","elderly","threshold detection method","inertial frame vertical velocity","detection algorithm","inflatable hip pad"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Elderly","fall detection","inertial sensor","preimpact"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Acceleration","Accidental Falls","Adult","Aged","Aged, 80 and over","Algorithms","Equipment Design","Equipment Failure Analysis","Feasibility Studies","Female","Hip Fractures","Humans","Male","Monitoring, Ambulatory","Monitoring, Ambulatory","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Protective Clothing","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Transducers"]},{"kwd":["elderly","fall dedetection","inertial sensor","pre-impact"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4435088/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Portable Preimpact Fall Detector With Inertial Sensors","volume":"16","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4435088/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9921045","pubMedId":"18403286","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Portable Preimpact Fall Detector With Inertial Sensors","sourcePdf":"16tnsre02-wu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063776S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"4483552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"141","xplore-issue":"4483552","articleId":"4435088","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4435090,"authors":[{"name":"Qing-Xin Chu","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4446042/4435090/4435090-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qing-Xin Chu (M'99) received the B.S., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 1982, 1987, and 1994, respectively.","He is currently a Full Professor with the College of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China.

In particular, we study the residual phase noise due to laser frequency fluctuations and the detector nonlinearity on microwave signals transmitted on an optical fiber, or generated in the opto-electronic oscillator (OEO). Based on experimental findings, we identify a significant reduction of the relative intensity noise of the laser if the received optical power saturates the photodiode. Furthermore, we suggest the use of a semiconductor optical amplifier in saturation as yet another means to reduce the phase noise induced by laser intensity fluctuations. We also identify the use of multiple photodetectors to reduce the influence of associated 1/f noise, which adds to the phase noise of a transmitted microwave signal, and is the ultimate limitation to the phase noise of the high-performance OEO. Reduction of noise that is due to optical interferences is also addressed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4435092/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2008","volume":"56","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"9748448","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4435092/","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"RF Amplitude and Phase-Noise Reduction of an Optical Link and an Opto-Electronic Oscillator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RF Amplitude and Phase-Noise Reduction of an Optical Link and an Opto-Electronic Oscillator","sourcePdf":"56tmtt02-eliyahu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056338S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4446042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"114","xplore-issue":"4446042","articleId":"4435092","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":4435094,"authors":[{"name":"Ullrich R.

The present work demonstrates the asynchronous decoding (i.e., where cues indicating the onset of movement are not known) of individual and combined finger movements. Single-unit activities were recorded sequentially from a population of neurons in the M1 hand area of trained rhesus monkeys during flexion and extension movements of each finger and the wrist. Nonlinear filters were designed to detect the onset of movement and decode the movement type from randomly selected neuronal ensembles (assembled from individually recorded single-unit activities). Average asynchronous decoding accuracies as high as 99.8%, 96.2%, and 90.5%, were achieved for individuated finger and wrist movements with three monkeys. Average decoding accuracy was still 92.5% when combined movements of two fingers were included. These results demonstrate that it is possible to asynchronously decode dexterous finger movements from a neuronal ensemble with high accuracy. This work takes an important step towards the development of a BMI for direct neural control of a state-of-the-art, multifingered hand prosthesis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous Decoding of Dexterous Finger Movements Using M1 Neurons","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2007.916289","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/4451151/04435096.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"14","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2007.916289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4451151","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4435096","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4435096/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous Decoding of Dexterous Finger Movements Using M1 Neurons","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4435096/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9784093","pubMedId":"18303800","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous Decoding of Dexterous Finger Movements Using M1 Neurons","sourcePdf":"16tnsre01-aggarwal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085778S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"4451151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"4451151","articleId":"4435096","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4435134,"authors":[{"name":"Anke Meyer-Base","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Anke","lastName":"Meyer-Base","id":"38275874400"},{"name":"Vera Thummler","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany"],"firstName":"Vera","lastName":"Thummler","id":"38271314900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"4435134","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability analysis","Neural networks","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Neurons","Very large scale integration","Hardware","Learning systems","Equations","Pattern recognition","Neurofeedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural nets","stability","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local-global stability analysis","unsupervised competitive neural network","pattern recognition","feature extraction","cluster analysis","multitime scale dynamics","continuous-time recurrent system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Competition","lateral inhibition","multitime scale system","nonlinear dynamics"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Humans","Information Storage and Retrieval","Neural Networks (Computer)","Pattern Recognition, Automated"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4435134","abstract":"Unsupervised competitive neural networks (UCNN) are an established technique in pattern recognition for feature extraction and cluster analysis.

The decision issues studied are the stopping criterion and the network retraining before computing the saliency. Experimental results indicate that the increase in the computational cost associated with retraining the network with every feature temporarily removed before computing the saliency is rewarded with a significant performance improvement. Despite being quite intuitive, this idea has been hardly used in practice. A somehow nonintuitive conclusion can be drawn by looking at the stopping criterion, suggesting that forcing overtraining may be as useful as early stopping. A significant improvement in the overall results with respect to learning with the whole set of variables is observed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multilayer perceptrons","Computer networks","Computational efficiency","Laboratories","Performance evaluation","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","learning (artificial intelligence)","multilayer perceptrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wrapper feature selection","multilayer perceptrons","sequential backward selection procedure","network retraining","stopping criterion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Experimental work","feature selection (FS)","multilayer perceptrons","wrapper approach"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Database Management Systems","Humans","Information Storage and Retrieval","Neural Networks (Computer)","Pattern Recognition, Automated"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TNN.2007.909535","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4459100/04435136.pdf","startPage":"431","endPage":"441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2007.909535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performing Feature Selection With Multilayer Perceptrons","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4435136","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performing Feature Selection With Multilayer Perceptrons","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4435136/","volume":"19","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4435136/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9913765","pubMedId":"18334363","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performing Feature Selection With Multilayer Perceptrons","sourcePdf":"19tnn03-romero.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129255S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4459100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"4459100","articleId":"4435136","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-21"},{"_id":4435137,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Shen","affiliation":["Department of Control Science and Engineering and the Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education for Image Processing and Intelligent Control, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Shen","id":"37274461700"},{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280531600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"4435137","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":101,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":521},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"abstract":"This brief paper presents an M-matrix-based algebraic criterion for the global exponential stability of a class of recurrent neural networks with decreasing time-varying delays.

Based on Lyapunov function method and the specific property of Householder transform, some criteria for the global synchronization are obtained. By these criteria, one can verify whether the coupled system with time-varying coupling is globally synchronized, which is important and useful for both understanding and interpreting synchronization phenomena and designing coupling configuration.

Motor current signature analysis (MCSA) techniques are applied to inspect the spectrum amplitudes at the broken rotor bar specific frequencies for abnormality and to decide about broken rotor bar fault detection and diagnosis. In this paper, we have demonstrated with experimental results that the use of a lower sampling rate with a digital notch filter is feasible for MCSA in broken rotor bar detection with discrete-time Fourier transform and autoregressive-based spectrum methods. The use of the lower sampling rate does not affect the performance of the fault detection, while requiring much less computation and low cost in implementation, which would make it easier to implement in embedded systems for motor condition monitoring.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4435192/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4435192/","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9897224","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Use of a Lower Sampling Rate for Broken Rotor Bar Detection With DTFT and AR-Based Spectrum Methods","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Use of a Lower Sampling Rate for Broken Rotor Bar Detection With DTFT and AR-Based Spectrum Methods","sourcePdf":"55tie03-ayhan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082682S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4459824","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"4459824","articleId":"4435192","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4435193,"authors":[{"name":"Tae-Sung Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Tae-Sung","lastName":"Kim","id":"38184384300"},{"name":"Sang-Kyoo Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Kyoo","lastName":"Han","id":"37278479600"},{"name":"Gun-Woo Moon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Gun-Woo","lastName":"Moon","id":"37277729800"},{"name":"Myung-Joong Youn","affiliation":["Kookmin University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Myung-Joong","lastName":"Youn","id":"37270756500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0046"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9948"}],"articleNumber":"4435193","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":732},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://ieee-ies.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4435193","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clamps","Multichip modules","Plasma displays","Zero voltage switching","Scanning probe microscopy","Inductors","Rectifiers","Diodes","Switches","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["driver circuits","modules","plasma displays","rectifying circuits","zero voltage switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active clamp forward converter","power module","plasma display panel","zero voltage switching","rectifier diodes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active clamp forward (ACF)","plasma display panel (PDP)","sustaining power module (SPM)"]},{"kwd":["Active clamp forward","sustaining power module","plasma display panel (PDP)"]}],"abstract":"A new high efficiency active clamp forward converter for the sustaining power module of a plasma display panel is proposed.

Performance measurements for a WMN, deployed using various routing metrics, are presented and corroborate our analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4435897/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"22","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9767672","htmlLink":"/document/4435897/","displayDocTitle":"Routing Metrics and Protocols for Wireless Mesh Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Routing Metrics and Protocols for Wireless Mesh Networks","sourcePdf":"005CAMPISTA.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059567S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"65","isNumber":"4435892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"194","xplore-issue":"4435892","articleId":"4435897","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4435904,"authors":[{"name":"Najah A.

Using detailed, long-term simulation models, this paper confirms that most power systems can absorb the impacts of wind power variations with little difficulty. Yet, since ramps in wind power and system demand could coincide, systems with limited ramping capabilities are at risk. It is shown that extending simulation models to include load dynamics and automatic generation control (AGC) time delays do not alter these conclusions. This paper also discusses wind penetration approaches and control area performance measures, linking the latter to the placement of the wind farms within the interconnection.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4435941/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 January 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9748235","volume":"23","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4435941/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Impacts of Wind Power Minute-to-Minute Variations on Power System Operation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impacts of Wind Power Minute-to-Minute Variations on Power System Operation","sourcePdf":"23tpwrs01-banakar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066708S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4435940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"4435940","articleId":"4435941","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4435946,"authors":[{"name":"Bogdan Enacheanu","affiliation":["Laboratoire d''Electrotechnique de Grenoble, Inventer la Distribution Electrique de lAvenir, Grenoble, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/4435940/4435946/4435946-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bogdan Enacheanu (S'06) was born in Curtea de Arges, Romania, on February 16, 1980.

These concepts are used in order to propose new intelligent and effective GA operators for efficient mutation and crossover well dedicated to the DN reconfiguration problem. All resulting individuals after GA operators are claimed to be feasible (radial) configurations. Moreover, the presented approach is valid for planar or nonplanar DN graph topologies and avoids tedious mesh checks for the topology constraint validation. The proposed method is finally compared to some previous topology coding techniques used by other authors.

It is shown that the Arrhenius extrapolation may overestimate the ten-year lifetime predictions. However, a clear correlation between the activation energy plot and the trap levels in the interpoly dielectric can be established, based on theoretical grounds. It is shown that a single-trap level typically follows an 1/T law, while a roll-off of the activation energy plot suggests the existence of various trap levels in the interpoly dielectrics.

To this aim, several efforts have been dedicated both on cell geometry and on material engineering. This paper addresses programming-current minimization by the optimization of the cell geometry and materials, programming-current scaling, and the tradeoff between programming and readout performances of the cell. A general procedure to find the optimum-cell geometry is proposed and applied to a prototype vertical cell. Then, the evolution of program and read performances through technology nodes is analyzed by numerical simulations with the aid of an analytical model, for both the isotropic- and nonisotropic-scaling approaches. The two scaling approaches are discussed and compared in terms of program and read cell performances. Finally, material optimization is considered for further program-read improvement.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2007.911630","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2007.911630","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/4435989/04436008.pdf","startPage":"506","endPage":"514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4435989","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of Programming and Read Performance in Phase-Change Memories\u2014Part I: Cell Optimization and Scaling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4436008/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 January 2008","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of Programming and Read Performance in Phase-Change Memories\u2014Part I: Cell Optimization and Scaling","volume":"55","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9758438","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4436008/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of Programming and Read Performance in Phase-Change Memories\u2014Part I: Cell Optimization and Scaling","sourcePdf":"55ted02-russo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086948S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"4435989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"4435989","articleId":"4436008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-29"},{"_id":4436009,"authors":[{"name":"Ugo Russo","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione and Italian Universities Nanoelectronics Team, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/4435989/4436009/4436009-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ugo Russo (S'07) was born in Palermo, Italy, in 1981.

While the current scaling has been addressed in a companion paper, we focus here on the thermal crosstalk, namely, the temperature increase in 1 bit in the array while an adjacent cell is being programmed by a high-current reset pulse. This parasitic heating may lead to partial crystallization in the amorphous phase and to a consequent resistance decrease after cycling. Our analysis shows that the thermal crosstalk strongly depends on the scaling approach used, e.g., isotropic or nonisotropic scaling. A new mixed-scaling option for PCM cells is proposed, which provides the maximum decrease of programming current compatible with the reliability requirements deriving from the thermal crosstalk. The effects of this new scaling approach on the programmed volume and data retention are finally addressed.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2007.913573","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/4435989/04436009.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2007.913573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4435989","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","startPage":"515","endPage":"522","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modeling of Programming and Read Performance in Phase-Change Memories\u2014Part II: Program Disturb and Mixed-Scaling Approach","volume":"55","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4436009/","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9758439","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4436009/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of Programming and Read Performance in Phase-Change Memories\u2014Part II: Program Disturb and Mixed-Scaling Approach","sourcePdf":"55ted02-russo2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066067S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"4435989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4435989","articleId":"4436009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4436012,"authors":[{"name":"Huaxiang Yin","affiliation":["SemiconductorDevice Laboratory, Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/4435989/4436012/4436012-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huaxiang Yin (M'06) was born in Hunan, China.

We show that DIF has a lower multiplicative complexity than DIT for similar PAPR reduction. A higher radix based FFT achieves better PAPR reduction per stage with less multiplicative complexity compared with a lower radix FFT. We further reduce the computational complexity by proposing a new technique, called decomposition PTS (D-PTS) subblocking, where subblocks are assigned through different stages of the transform. This new technique reduces the multiplicative complexity, while providing PAPR reduction similar to other techniques such as original PTS (O-PTS).

First, a tight lower bound on the mean-squared error (MSE) of pilot-aided channel estimates is derived, along with necessary and sufficient conditions on the pilot/data pattern that achieves this bound. From these conditions, novel minimum-MSE (MMSE) PAT schemes are proposed and upper/lower bounds on their ergodic achievable rates are derived. A pilot/data power allocation technique is also developed. A high-SNR asymptotic analysis of the ergodic achievable rate of affine MMSE-PAT is then performed which suggests that the channel's spreading parameters should be taken into account when choosing among affine MMSE-PAT schemes. Specifically, we establish that multicarrier MMSE-PAT achieves higher rates than single-carrier MMSE-PAT when the channel's delay-spread dominates its Doppler-spread, and vice versa.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4451275/04436017.pdf","startPage":"1148","endPage":"1160","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.908969","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.908969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4451275","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4436017","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Analysis of MMSE Pilot-Aided Cyclic-Prefixed Block Transmissions for Doubly Selective Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Transmitters","OFDM","Decoding","Acoustic signal processing","Wireless communication","Bandwidth","Channel capacity","Sufficient conditions","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","channel estimation","Doppler effect","mean square error methods","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic-prefixed block transmissions","doubly selective channels","pilot-aided transmission","single antenna","complex-exponential basis expansion model","mean-squared error","minimum-MSE","power allocation","high-SNR asymptotic analysis","Doppler spread","channel estimation","wireless transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Achievable rates","channel estimation","doubly dispersive channels","doubly selective channels","minimum mean-squared error (MMSE)","noncoherent channels","optimal training","pilot-assisted wireless transmissions","pilot symbols"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4436017/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2008","displayDocTitle":"Design and Analysis of MMSE Pilot-Aided Cyclic-Prefixed Block Transmissions for Doubly Selective Channels","volume":"56","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4436017/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9920595","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Analysis of MMSE Pilot-Aided Cyclic-Prefixed Block Transmissions for Doubly Selective Channels","sourcePdf":"56tsp03-kannu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128304S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4451275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"4451275","articleId":"4436017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4436022,"authors":[{"name":"Guanghai Gong","affiliation":[" Power Electronic Systems Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4444586/4436022/4436022-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guanghai Gong (S'03) was born in Zhejiang, China, in 1977.

Therefore, there is a growing interest in increasing the efficiency of LPAs, e.g., for the realization of high power testing voltage sources. In this paper, a high-frequency isolated boost-type tracking power supply (TPS) system is proposed for the conditioning of the input voltage of an LPA. The output voltage of the TPS is varied according to the voltage to be formed by the LPA so that the voltage drop across the power amplifier output transistors is reduced to low values. This results in a significant increase of the total system efficiency. The operating principle of the proposed system is described. A design method for the output filter using the power supply rejection ratio of the LPA is proposed. This method ensures that the amplifier output voltage has minimal switching frequency components. Furthermore, a control system design method is presented that ensures good performance in the control of the constant inductor current of the switch-mode tracking stage.

The current commands are chosen to be optimal so as to minimize power loss not only in the constant-torque region but also in the constant-power region. Our approach aims at the same objective as the previously known flux-weakening control. Furthermore, the motor torque of an IPM motor in magnetic saturation can be made exactly linear with respect to the torque command. Thereby, our systematic approach can provide not only maximal power efficiency but also torque linearity. In doing so, we consider a more general situation than that considered in prior literature. Specifically speaking, the physical constraints in stator currents and voltages, and the effect of stator resistance are all taken into full account. As a result, the optimization problem becomes very complicated. Nonetheless, we have successfully found the approximate optimal solution, which can be readily implemented on a usual high-speed microprocessor. The practical effectiveness of the proposed control method is also demonstrated through various simulation and experimental results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4436023/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2008","accessionNumber":"9897241","htmlLink":"/document/4436023/","displayDocTitle":"Flux-Weakening Control of IPM Motors With Significant Effect of Magnetic Saturation and Stator Resistance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flux-Weakening Control of IPM Motors With Significant Effect of Magnetic Saturation and Stator Resistance","sourcePdf":"55tie03-jo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093072S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4459824","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"4459824","articleId":"4436023","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4436024,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Jae Lee","affiliation":["LCD Business, Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd., Asan, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4444586/4436024/4436024-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jong-Jae Lee was born in Daejeon, Korea, in 1976.

The proposed converter employs an active-clamp technique, while a series-resonant scheme controls the output voltage with the complementary pulsewidth modulation controller. The active-clamp circuit serves to recycle the energy stored in the leakage inductance or the magnetizing inductance and provides zero-voltage turn-on switching. The voltage stresses of the main switch are clamped. Moreover, the proposed dual series-resonant circuit provides two resonant-current paths formed by the leakage inductance and the output resonant capacitors, and a zero-current turn-off switching of diodes is achieved by its dual resonance. In addition, voltage stresses of the output diodes are clamped to the output voltage. Thus, the proposed active-clamp dc-dc converter using a dual series-resonant circuit is analyzed and optimized for high power efficiency. Experimental results for a 400 W dc-dc converter at a constant switching frequency of 100 kHz are obtained to show the performance of the proposed converter.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4444586/04436024.pdf","startPage":"699","endPage":"710","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.911912","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.911912","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4444586","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4436024","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual Series-Resonant Active-Clamp Converter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DC-DC power converters","Magnetic resonance","Inductance","Pulse width modulation converters","Voltage control","Switching circuits","Stress","Switches","Diodes","Switching converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitor switching","DC-DC power convertors","inductance","PWM power convertors","resonant power convertors","switching convertors","zero voltage switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual series-resonant active-clamp converter","DC-DC converter","voltage control","complementary pulsewidth modulation controller","leakage inductance","magnetizing inductance","zero-voltage turn-on switching","resonant capacitor","power 400 W","frequency 100 kHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active-clamp circuit","dual series-resonant circuit","full-wave rectified output current","zero-current switching","zerovoltage switching"]},{"kwd":["Dual series-resonant circuit","active-clamp circuit","zero-voltage switching","zero-current switching","full-wave rectified output current"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4436024/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2008","displayDocTitle":"Dual Series-Resonant Active-Clamp Converter","volume":"55","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4436024/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9748407","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual Series-Resonant Active-Clamp Converter","sourcePdf":"55tie02-lee2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08157S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4444586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"4444586","articleId":"4436024","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4436026,"authors":[{"name":"Chien-Ming Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National I-Lan University, Ilan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4444586/4436026/4436026-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chien-Ming Wang (M\u201904) was born in Miao-Li, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1966.

In this paper, we report a cryptanalysis of this BSS-based encryption scheme and point out that it is not secure against known-/chosen-plaintext attack and chosen-ciphertext attack. In addition, we discuss some other security defects of the schemes: (1) it has a low sensitivity to part of the key and to the plaintext; (2) it is weak against a ciphertext-only differential attack; and (3) a divide-and-conquer (DAC) attack can be used to break part of the key. We finally analyze the role of BSS in this approach towards cryptographically secure ciphers.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.916540","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4516005/04436041.pdf","startPage":"1055","endPage":"1063","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.916540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4516005","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cryptanalyzing an Encryption Scheme Based on Blind Source Separation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4436041","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4436041/","displayDocTitle":"Cryptanalyzing an Encryption Scheme Based on Blind Source Separation","volume":"55","issue":"4","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9966170","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4436041/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cryptanalyzing an Encryption Scheme Based on Blind Source Separation","sourcePdf":"55tcsi04-li3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086143S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4516005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4516005","articleId":"4436041","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4436043,"authors":[{"name":"Kofi M.

The INS technique simplifies the design of both the switched-capacitor (SC) sensing amplifier and its supporting building blocks without jeopardizing its performance. This is done by counteracting the impact of charge injection and clock-feedthrough effects on sensitivity, resolution, and offset. It also decreases the number of opamps, capacitors, and switches being used. This results in reduction of power consumption, potential switching noise, and noise (sampled thermal noise which increases with the number of SC pairs being used) in the ASIC. A two-chip approach has been adopted in the implementation, with sensing element and ASIC. The built-in trimming circuitry and signal-conditioning blocks, which includes a self-test circuit, are implemented internally to eliminate the need for external components. The experimental results have shown that the sensing system IC has achieved a power consumption of 10 mW (2 mA at 5 V), a maximum noise root spectral density of 11.87 equivalent to rms noise root spectral density of 0.187 at 15.63 Hz, a signal-to-noise dynamic range of 77dB for 500-Hz bandwidth and 74 dB for 1-kHz bandwidth based on 50 g, and a maximum clock noise of 1.562 mV. The die size of the ASIC is 2.8 mm 2.3 mm using a standard 0.6- mum CMOS technology.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4436073/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","volume":"55","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","accessionNumber":"9966169","publicationDate":"May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4436073/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Capacitive-Based Accelerometer IC Using Injection-Nulling Switch Technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Capacitive-Based Accelerometer IC Using Injection-Nulling Switch Technique","sourcePdf":"55tcsi04-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076194S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4516005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4516005","articleId":"4436073","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4436075,"authors":[{"name":"Tsz Yin Man","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4539047/4436075/4436075-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tsz Yin Man (S'01) received the B.Eng.

The proposed design results in quasi-cyclic G-LDPC codes for which efficient encoding is feasible through shift-register-based circuits. The structure imposed on the bipartite graphs, together with the choice of simple component codes, leads to a class of codes suitable for fast iterative decoding. A pragmatic approach to the construction of G-LDPC codes is proposed. The approach is based on the substitution of check nodes in the protograph of a low-density parity-check code with stronger nodes based, for instance, on Hamming codes. Such a design approach, which we call LDPC code doping, leads to low-rate quasi-cyclic G-LDPC codes with excellent performance in both the error floor and waterfall regions on the additive white Gaussian noise channel.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.050600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.050600","startPage":"49","endPage":"57","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4436078/04436088.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4436078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quasi-cyclic generalized ldpc codes with low error floors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4436088/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 January 2008","displayDocTitle":"Quasi-cyclic generalized ldpc codes with low error floors","volume":"56","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9836287","publicationDate":"January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4436088/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quasi-cyclic generalized ldpc codes with low error floors","sourcePdf":"tc_0801_049.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118086S","chronDate":"January  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4436078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"4436078","articleId":"4436088","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4436090,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaowei Jin","affiliation":["Motorola, Inc., Schaumburg, IL, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4436078/4436090/4436090-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaowei Jin received the B.S. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1999, the M.S. degree from Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, in 2006, all in Electrical Engineering.","Since Feb. 2006, Dr. Jin has been with the Spectrum Engineering Center (SEC) of the Motorola Wireless Solutions and Research Lab.

These approximators employ a novel self-organizing radial basis function (RBF) network, which varies its structure dynamically to keep the prescribed approximation accuracy. The RBFs can be added or removed online in order to achieve the appropriate network complexity for the real-time approximation of the dynamical systems and to maintain the overall computational efficiency. The performance of this variable structure RBF network approximator with both Gaussian RBF (GRBF) and raised-cosine RBF (RCRBF) is analyzed. The compact support of RCRBF enables faster training and easier output evaluation of the network than that of the network with GRBF. The proposed real-time self-organizing RBF network approximator is then employed to approximate both linear and nonlinear dynamical systems to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approximation scheme, especially for higher order dynamical systems. The uniform ultimate boundedness of the approximation error is proved using the second method of Lyapunov. </para>","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2007.909842","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4459100/04436181.pdf","startPage":"460","endPage":"474","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2007.909842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-Organizing Radial Basis Function Network for Real-Time Approximation of Continuous-Time Dynamical Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4436181/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2008","displayDocTitle":"Self-Organizing Radial Basis Function Network for Real-Time Approximation of Continuous-Time Dynamical Systems","volume":"19","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2008","accessionNumber":"9913762","pubMedId":"18334365","publicationDate":"March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4436181/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Organizing Radial Basis Function Network for Real-Time Approximation of Continuous-Time Dynamical Systems","sourcePdf":"19tnn03-lian.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089894S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4459100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"4459100","articleId":"4436181","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4436183,"authors":[{"name":"Huaguang Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Integrated Automation of Process Industry, Northeastern University, National Education Ministry, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Huaguang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280792300"},{"name":"Yingchun Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Yingchun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407578600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"4436183","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":261,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":696},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4436183","abstract":"In this letter, the global asymptotical stability analysis problem is considered for a class of Markovian jumping stochastic Cohen-Grossberg neural networks (CGNNs) with mixed delays including discrete delays and distributed delays.

The resistance calculations automatically take account of skin and proximity effects and are capable of handling arbitrarily complex multimaterial systems. The simulations also yield a detailed 3-D picture of the magnetic-field diffusion through a complex multimaterial coil in the presence of arbitrary time-dependent current waveforms. Hence, they can provide critical insight into coil performance in real-life systems. We report on the critical issues that must be kept in mind for such simulations and the results of test problems with simple coil geometries.

The mixed-mode sampling technique reduces signal swings in pipelined ADCs while maintaining the signal-to-noise ratio. The reduction of signal swings relaxes the operational amplifier (opamp) gain, slew rate, bandwidth, and capacitor-matching requirements in pipelined ADCs. Due to the mixed-mode S/H technique, the single-stage opamps and small capacitor sizes can be used in this pipelined ADC, leading to a high speed and low-power consumption. Fabricated in a 0.18-mum CMOS process, the 8-bit pipelined ADC consumes 22 mW with 1.8-V supply voltage. When sampling at 200 MSample/s, the prototype ADC achieves 54-dB spurious free dynamic range and 45-dB signal-to-noise and distortion ratio.

The NN-based sensor model automatically linearizes and compensates for the adverse effects arising due to nonlinear response characteristics and nonlinear dependency of the sensor characteristics on the environmental variables. To show the potential of the proposed NN-based technique, we have provided results of a smart capacitive pressure sensor (CPS) operating under a wide range of temperature variation. A multilayer perceptron is utilized to transfer the nonlinear CPS characteristics at any operating temperature to a linearized response characteristics. Through extensive simulated experiments, we have shown that the NN-based CPS model can provide pressure readout with a maximum full-scale error of only 1.5% over a temperature range of 50 to 200 with excellent linearized response for all the three forms of nonlinear dependencies considered. Performance of the proposed technique is compared with a recently proposed computationally efficient NN-based extreme learning machine. The proposed multilayer perceptron based model is tested by using experimentally measured real sensor data, and found to have satisfactory performance.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.916617","startPage":"1316","endPage":"1327","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4539047/04436208.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.916617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4539047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural-Network-Based Robust Linearization and Compensation Technique for Sensors Under Nonlinear Environmental Influences","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Intelligent sensors","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Temperature sensors","Temperature distribution","Multilayer perceptrons","Artificial neural networks","Capacitive sensors","Temperature dependence","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitive sensors","electrical engineering computing","intelligent sensors","multilayer perceptrons","pressure sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural-network-based robust linearization","compensation technique","nonlinear environmental influences","smart sensors","harsh environments","adverse effects","nonlinear response characteristics","nonlinear dependency","smart capacitive pressure sensor","multilayer perceptron","linearized response characteristics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial neural networks (NNs)","auto-compensation","harsh environment","intelligent and smart sensors","linearization","pressure sensor"]},{"kwd":["Intelligent and smart sensors","artificial neural networks","pressure sensor","linearization","auto-compensation","harsh environment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4436208/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 June 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","displayDocTitle":"Neural-Network-Based Robust Linearization and Compensation Technique for Sensors Under Nonlinear Environmental Influences","volume":"55","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4436208/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2008","accessionNumber":"10050673","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural-Network-Based Robust Linearization and Compensation Technique for Sensors Under Nonlinear Environmental Influences","sourcePdf":"55tcsi05-patra.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110175S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4539047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4539047","articleId":"4436208","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4436228,"authors":[{"name":"I.

In the application of spectrum pooling in OFDM-based Cognitive Radio system there will be subcarriers that are deactivated due to the access of Licensed Users. The unloaded subcarriers that are caused by Licensed Users access create problems in performing channel estimation. The unloaded subcarriers restrict putting the pilot symbols in time and frequency lattice. This issue should be considered in the designing pilot symbols grid. In the part I of this paper, new pilot patterns for OFDM-based Cognitive Radio channel estimation are proposed. These new pilot patterns are the modification of rectangular pilot patterns by shifting the pilot subcarricrs into the adjacent subcarriers which are free from the interference of Licensed Users. Using the proposed pilot patterns, the channel estimation based on two cascaded one dimensional (2 times 1-D) Wiener filter is investigated by considering the appearance of narrowband and wideband Licensed Users. Results have shown that the proposed pilot pattern outperforms the regular pilot pattern by around 6.5 dB gain at Mean Square Error value of 2 times 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>\n in the case of narrowband interference.","doi":"10.1109/SCVT.2007.4436228","publicationTitle":"2007 14th IEEE Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology in the Benelux","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 14th IEEE Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology in the Benelux","pdfPath":"/iel5/4436226/4436227/04436228.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCVT.2007.4436228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4436227","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Pilot Pattern for OFDM-based Cognitive Radio Channel Estimation - Part 1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4436228","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Pilot Pattern for OFDM-based Cognitive Radio Channel Estimation - Part 1","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-15 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4436228/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-15 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9774858","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4436228/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Pilot Pattern for OFDM-based Cognitive Radio Channel Estimation - Part 1","confLoc":"Delft, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"SCVT07-00-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045221S","chronDate":"15-15 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4436226","isNumber":"4436227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4436226","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4436227","articleId":"4436228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4436235,"authors":[{"name":"Deepaknath Tandur","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Deepaknath","lastName":"Tandur","id":"37646146900"},{"name":"Marc Moonen","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Moonen","id":"37274397700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1369-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1370-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2373-0854"}],"articleNumber":"4436235","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":227},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Radio transmitters","Frequency domain analysis","Filters","OFDM modulation","Costs","Discrete Fourier transforms","Degradation","Adaptive equalizers","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","equalisers","frequency-domain analysis","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain equalization","RF imperfection compensation technique","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","frequency-selective channel","broadband wireless system","interblock-interference","CFO","carrier frequency offset","frequency selective IQ imbalance"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we propose a generally applicable frequency-domain equalization and radio frequency (RF) imperfection compensation technique for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission over frequency-selective channels.

Due to component imperfections in practical analog electronics such imbalances are unavoidable, resulting in an overall performance degradation of the system. In this paper the joint effect of frequency selective IQ imbalance at both transmitter and receiver end along with CFO is studied for OFDM based transmission.

However, due to its low power, IEEE 802.15.4 is potentially vulnerable to interference by other wireless technologies having much higher power and working in the same industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band such as IEEE 802.11 b/g. The paper therefore focuses on the coexistence impact of IEEE 802.11 b/g on the IEEE 802.15.4. In this paper, we present a coexistence model of IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11 b/g, which exposes the interactive behavior between these two standards and therefore accurately explains their coexistence performance. The model focuses on two aspects, namely power and timing. These two aspects jointly impose different impacts on the performance of IEEE 802.15.4 networks, depending on coexistence situations. To classify the coexistence situations, we introduce a concept of coexistence range, by extending the concept of sensing and interference ranges across different wireless standards. We characterize the coexistence behavior in each coexistence range and identify for each range the underlying coexistence mechanism and protocol interactions. Analytical models are proposed for the case of saturated traffic and simulation results are presented to validate the model.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 14th IEEE Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology in the Benelux","pdfPath":"/iel5/4436226/4436227/04436237.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2007 14th IEEE Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology in the Benelux","doi":"10.1109/SCVT.2007.4436237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCVT.2007.4436237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4436227","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4436237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Coexistence Model of IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11b/g","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Wireless sensor networks","Analytical models","Wireless communication","Timing","Protocols","Traffic control","Power system modeling","Performance evaluation","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["personal area networks","telecommunication traffic","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coexistence model","IEEE 802.15.4","IEEE 802.11 b/g","low-rate wireless communication","wireless technologies","industrial-scientific-medical band","wireless standards","saturated traffic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4436237/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-15 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Coexistence Model of IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11b/g","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4436237/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9774824","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","conferenceDate":"15-15 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Coexistence Model of IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11b/g","confLoc":"Delft, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"SCVT07-00-10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064004S","chronDate":"15-15 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4436226","isNumber":"4436227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4436226","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4436227","articleId":"4436237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4436240,"authors":[{"name":"Felix Brah","affiliation":["Communications and Remote Sensing Laboratory, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Felix","lastName":"Brah","id":"37296963600"},{"name":"Luc Vandendorpe","affiliation":["Communications and Remote Sensing Laboratory, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Luc","lastName":"Vandendorpe","id":"37269898400"},{"name":"Jerome Louveaux","affiliation":["Communications and Remote Sensing Laboratory, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jerome","lastName":"Louveaux","id":"37296869400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1369-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1370-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2373-0854"}],"articleNumber":"4436240","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":221},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Transmitters","Channel estimation","Performance gain","Channel state information","Feedback","Delay estimation","Downlink","Base stations","Constraint optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","channel estimation","frequency division multiple access","multiuser channels","quality of service","radio links","resource allocation","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constrained resource allocation","channel knowledge","adaptive resource allocation","channel state information","transmitter","channel estimation","channel feedback delay","downlink multiuser OFDMA systems","base station","subchannel assignment","power allocation","QoS","non-convex finite dimensional stochastic problem","Lagrange dual decomposition framework","optimal allocation"]}],"abstract":"Adaptive resource allocation has been shown to provide substantial performance gain in OFDMA based wireless systems when perfect channel state information (CSI) is available at the transmitter. However, perfect CSI at the transmitter (CSIT) is rarely possible due to channel estimation errors and channel feedback delay. In this paper, we consider practical resource allocation strategies for downlink multiuser OFDMA systems, where the base station has imperfect CSI. We address the problem of subchannel assignment and power allocation, to maximize the ergodic sum utility under QoS, fairness and total power constraints. This constrained optimization problem is formulated as a non-convex finite dimensional stochastic problem. We use Lagrange dual decomposition framework to derive an algorithm that efficiently finds the optimal allocation. Simulation results show the impact of the channel estimation error on the performance of the system and illustrate the trade-off between maximized utility and the constraints.","doi":"10.1109/SCVT.2007.4436240","publicationTitle":"2007 14th IEEE Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology in the Benelux","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 14th IEEE Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology in the Benelux","pdfPath":"/iel5/4436226/4436227/04436240.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCVT.2007.4436240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4436227","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDMA Constrained Resource Allocation with imperfect Channel Knowledge","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4436240","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"OFDMA Constrained Resource Allocation with imperfect Channel Knowledge","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-15 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4436240/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-15 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9774860","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4436240/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDMA Constrained Resource Allocation with imperfect Channel Knowledge","confLoc":"Delft, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"SCVT07-00-13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040111S","chronDate":"15-15 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4436226","isNumber":"4436227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4436226","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4436227","articleId":"4436240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4436242,"authors":[{"name":"I.

In this paper, we show that by being aware of how this long channel is generated, we can design a more efficient pilot scheme. The core idea consists in assigning orthogonal pilot sequences to the transmitters belonging to the same SFN. This allows the receivers for a separate estimate of each of the propagation channels.

This paper studies the extension of SSD with recursive systematic convolutional (RSC) coded BICM and constellation rotation in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system. Iterative demodulation and decoding (ID) is employed at the receiver. It is shown that for a signal constellation and labeling using SSD on a frequency-selective fading channel, a well considered choice of the rotation angle leads to a significant gain over the conventional BICM-ID OFDM system. Furthermore, the choice of the rotation angle for the system is found to be dependent upon the symbol labeling and the number of iterations performed between the demodulator and the decoder.","doi":"10.1109/SCVT.2007.4436247","publicationTitle":"2007 14th IEEE Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology in the Benelux","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 14th IEEE Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology in the Benelux","pdfPath":"/iel5/4436226/4436227/04436247.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCVT.2007.4436247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4436227","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM with BICM-ID and Rotated MPSK Constellations and Signal Space Diversity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4436247","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"OFDM with BICM-ID and Rotated MPSK Constellations and Signal Space Diversity","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-15 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4436247/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-15 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9774850","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4436247/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM with BICM-ID and Rotated MPSK Constellations and Signal Space Diversity","confLoc":"Delft, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"SCVT07-00-20.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045274S","chronDate":"15-15 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4436226","isNumber":"4436227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4436226","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4436227","articleId":"4436247","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4436249,"authors":[{"name":"G.

However, the performance of linear detection schemes is affected by the residual inter-symbol interference (ISI) and the correlated noise present in decision variables. In order to improve the performance, a decision feedback equalization (DFE) scheme is proposed in this paper. In the feedback stage, an optimal Wiener filter is designed to predict and suppress the residual ISI and the correlated noise caused by the channel equalization and code despreading in the feedforward stage. Simulations show that the proposed DFE scheme significantly outperforms the conventional linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) receiver. By this scheme, a noise penalty between MC-CDMA and ideally coded OFDM is largely reduced.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 14th IEEE Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology in the Benelux","pdfPath":"/iel5/4436226/4436227/04436262.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2007 14th IEEE Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology in the Benelux","doi":"10.1109/SCVT.2007.4436262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCVT.2007.4436262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4436227","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4436262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wiener Feedback Filtering for Suppression of Residual ISI and Correlated Noise in MC-CDMA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wiener filter","Filtering","Intersymbol interference","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Decision feedback equalizers","OFDM","Frequency diversity","Radio communication","Noise reduction","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","decision feedback equalisers","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","OFDM modulation","Wiener filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Wiener feedback filtering","multicarrier CDMA","residual intersymbol interference","decision feedback equalization","DFE scheme","linear minimum mean-square error receiver","MMSE","coded OFDM","residual ISI sppression","correlated noise suppression","MC-CDMA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4436262/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-15 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Wiener Feedback Filtering for Suppression of Residual ISI and Correlated Noise in MC-CDMA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4436262/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9774827","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","conferenceDate":"15-15 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wiener Feedback Filtering for Suppression of Residual ISI and Correlated Noise in MC-CDMA","confLoc":"Delft, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"SCVT07-00-35.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05268S","chronDate":"15-15 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4436226","isNumber":"4436227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4436226","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4436227","articleId":"4436262","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4436331,"authors":[{"name":"Jinyuan Wu","affiliation":["Fenni National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Jinyuan Wu","id":"37279159400"},{"name":"Sten Hansen","affiliation":["Fenni National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Sten Hansen","id":"37273401800"},{"name":"Zonghan Shi","affiliation":["Fenni National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Zonghan Shi","id":"37278372400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0922-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0923-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3654"}],"articleNumber":"4436331","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":975},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Voltage","Pins","Clocks","Nuclear and plasma sciences","Logic","Nuclear electronics","Pulse circuits","Filters","Latches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","field programmable gate arrays","nuclear electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA devices","analog waveform digitizers","ramping-comparing scheme","multichannel ADC","passive RC network","FPGA differential input buffers","time-to-digital-converters","Fermilab MIPP electronics upgrade","digital phase follower"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Front End Electronics","TDC","ADC","Deserializer","FPGA Firmware"]}],"abstract":"Several tests of FPGA devices programmed as analog waveform digitizers are discussed.

The purpose of API method is for the elemental analysis and TDC shows the location of target object. In order to manage high resolution TDC timing, we used the propagation delay on the internal wires of field programmable gate array (FPGA) chips, utilized the place and route (P&R) delay difference. By setting P&R area constraints, we generated two precise ring oscillators with slightly different frequencies. The time difference between two ring oscillators is the time bin resolution of TDC. The multi-channel number of alpha-gamma event depends on the size of FPGA gates and configurable. Experimental results showed that the time interval of two ring oscillators of FPGA is about 100 ps, and varied by the lock detection between the operating frequencies of two ring oscillators that differ within 100 ps. After implementation of TDC counter TOF tagging schemes such as time stamp and control logic were generated and the event rate at each channel was more than 1 MHz. Finally, we investigated that TOF FPGA was useful in the multi-channel analyzer to measure the time interval between alpha-gamma of API system.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2007.4436440","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel5/4436263/4436264/04436440.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2007.4436440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4436264","startPage":"761","endPage":"764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TDC module for time-of-flight","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4436440","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"TDC module for time-of-flight","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 26 2007-Nov. 3 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4436440/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26 Oct.-3 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9906691","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4436440/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TDC module for time-of-flight","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01162008-00176.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047316S","chronDate":"Oct. 26 2007-Nov. 3 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4436263","isNumber":"4436264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4436263","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4436264","articleId":"4436440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4436453,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Xu","affiliation":["Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Hao Xu","id":"37536039400"},{"name":"Zhan'an Liu","affiliation":["Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhan'an Liu","id":"37671585400"},{"name":"Yunpeng Lu","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"lastName":"Yunpeng Lu","id":"37835750100"},{"name":"Lu Li","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"lastName":"Lu Li","id":"37677471100"},{"name":"Dixin Zhao","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"lastName":"Dixin Zhao","id":"37832489700"},{"name":"Ya'nan Guo","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"lastName":"Ya'nan Guo","id":"37833277900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0922-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0923-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3654"}],"articleNumber":"4436453","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"abstract":"The article described a new design of high-speed data transmission, used in BESIII trigger system, with optical fibre that was based on the on-chip serial/deserial transceiver in FPGA.

Most of them consist of ldquomixingrdquo the confidential information being transmitted through an insecure channel, with a chaotic analog or digital sequence. The recovering of the original information usually calls for reproducing, at the receiver side, the same chaotic signal as at the transmitter side. The synchronization mechanism of the two chaotic signals is known as \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">chaos</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">synchronization</i>\n.

After briefly examining the main preamplifier noise sources, residing in the input element, achievable resolution limits in charge measuring systems employing such technologies are discussed under different detector capacitance, processing time and power dissipation constraints. The equivalent noise charge model adopted in this work takes into account the behavior of series 1/f noise as a function of the overdrive voltage in PMOS devices. Moreover, noise in the gate current, whose effects could be neglected in past CMOS technologies featuring larger gate oxide thickness, is shown to play a role in the optimization process, significantly affecting the preamplifier performance at long shaping times. The extent of this contribution, besides depending on the drain current in the input device, is also determined by its drain voltage, which therefore may become a critical parameter in the design of low noise analog blocks.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4436631","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2007.4436661","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel5/4436263/4436631/04436661.pdf","startPage":"2494","endPage":"2502","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2007.4436661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum noise design of charge amplifiers with CMOS processes in the 100 nm feature size range","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 26 2007-Nov. 3 2007","displayDocTitle":"Minimum noise design of charge amplifiers with CMOS processes in the 100 nm feature size range","isConference":true,"volume":"4","conferenceDate":"26 Oct.-3 Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4436661/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9906902","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4436661/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum noise design of charge amplifiers with CMOS processes in the 100 nm feature size range","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01162008-00030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066797S","chronDate":"Oct. 26 2007-Nov. 3 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4436263","isNumber":"4436631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4436263","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4436631","articleId":"4436661","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":4436664,"authors":[{"name":"Sachin S Junnarkar","affiliation":["Brockhaven National Laboratory, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Sachin S","lastName":"Junnarkar","id":"37276664300"},{"name":"Sudeep Mitra","affiliation":["Brockhaven National Laboratory, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Sudeep","lastName":"Mitra","id":"37831636900"},{"name":"Rejean Fontaine","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrook, Sherbrooke, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Rejean","lastName":"Fontaine","id":"37276636700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0922-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0923-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3654"}],"articleNumber":"4436664","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4436664","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Instruments","Neutrons","Spectroscopy","Alpha particles","Soil","Gamma ray detection","Gamma ray detectors","Aerospace electronics","Particle scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["alpha-particle detection","analogue-digital conversion","coincidence techniques","deuteron-nucleus reactions","field programmable gate arrays","gamma-ray detection","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","field deployable instrumentation system","neutron time of flight sub nanosecond coincidence spectroscopy","Associated Particle Technique","3H(d,n)4He","neutron generator","inelastic scattering","gamma-ray emission","alpha particle detection","gamma-ray detection","neutron interaction"]}],"abstract":"In this report, we present a novel FPGA based electronics architecture for sub-nanosecond coincidence spectroscopy in a neutron time-of- flight system employing the Associated Particle Technique (APT).. In the APT [S. MITRA, J.E. WOLFF, et.al,,] the alpha particle associated with a 14 MeV neutron produced by the 3H(d,n)4He reaction in the neutron generator is emitted in nearly the opposite direction. When a neutron collides with the soil matrix, one probable interaction is an inelastic scattering by a C atom producing the characteristic gamma-ray emission. The elapsed time between detection of the alpha particle and detection of the gamma-ray reveals the distance traveled by the neutron and provides the depth of neutron interaction with C in the soil as shown in Fig.l. Since 14 MeV neutrons travel at a speed of 5 cm/ns, it is important to achieve sub nanosecond time resolutions to be able to resolve depth profiles of C layers less than 5 cm thick.","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel5/4436263/4436631/04436664.pdf","startPage":"2513","endPage":"2518","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2007.4436664","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2007.4436664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4436631","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA based field deployable instrumentation system for neutron time of flight sub nanosecond coincidence spectroscopy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA based field deployable instrumentation system for neutron time of flight sub nanosecond coincidence spectroscopy","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4436664/","conferenceDate":"26 Oct.-3 Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4436664/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9927361","isConference":true,"volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 26 2007-Nov. 3 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA based field deployable instrumentation system for neutron time of flight sub nanosecond coincidence spectroscopy","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01162008-00033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113109S","chronDate":"Oct. 26 2007-Nov. 3 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4436263","isNumber":"4436631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4436263","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4436631","articleId":"4436664","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4436680,"authors":[{"name":"Christoph W.

The method of interaction depth measurement is based on analogue computation of the standard deviation with an enhanced charge divider readout. This technique of depth of interaction detection was developed in order to provide fast and determination of this parameter at a reasonable increase of detector cost. The detector consists of an large-sized monolithic scintillator coupled to a position sensitive photomultiplier tube. A special design feature is the flat-topped pyramidal shape of the crystal. This reduces image compression near the edges of the scintillator. We studied the image enhancement qualitatively with a FDG filled hot spot phantom and quantitatively by displacing a single point source along a radial axis. An important uniformity improvement was observed for the reconstructed image of the hot spot phantom when depth of interaction correction was applied. A moderate improvement of the spatial resolution was observed when reconstructing the images of the point source with depth of interaction correction.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Nuclear

to correct system matrix for microPET image reconstruction using artificial neural network","abstract":"The aim of this study was to improve image quality of statistical reconstruction by using the system matrix (SM) which was trained with artificial neural network (ANN). For training the ANN SM, six input and desired output pairs were generated. The inputs, the digital images, were generated by scanning the mini deluxe cold spot phantom at six different orientations using an optical scanner (resolution: 2400 dpi). Furthermore, the desired outputs were generated by acquiring the projection data with the corresponding angles using the microPET R4. The input and output pairs were used for training the ANN SM. In ANN method, the AD ALINE network with a bias vector was used. The SM, which was created by the geometric information, was treated as the initial guess, and the learning rate was set to le-7 to avoid learning error. The moment term (r = 0.95) was included to improve the stability of the optimization. The inputs were sent to the ANN SM which was updated to minimize the mean square error between the outputs and desired outputs. Moreover, a multi-line source phantom was scanned to obtain the spatial resolutions for comparison. A rat FDG microPET image was acquired to compare the difference between the results reconstructed by the original SM and those by the ANN SM. In the experiment of multi-line source phantom, the resolutions of reconstructed image were measured at center, 10 mm, 20 mm and reconstructed FWHMs by the original SM were 1.61,1.82, and 2.32 mm, respectively. The resolutions reconstructed by the ANN SM were 1.27,1.66, and 1.89 mm. The data size of the original SM and the ANN SM were 90.1,180.0 MB, respectively. The time for reconstruction of the original SM was two times faster than that of the ANN SM. The image quality reconstructed by the ANN SM is better than that reconstructed by the original SM. The results suggested that SM can be updated toward ideal SM using ANN for statistical reconstruction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 26 2007-Nov. 3 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4436721/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9891674","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4436721/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","conferenceDate":"26 Oct.-3 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A feasible method to correct system matrix for microPET image reconstruction using artificial neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A feasible method to correct system matrix for microPET image reconstruction using artificial neural network","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI","sourcePdf":"SPI-01162008-00090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087661S","chronDate":"Oct. 26 2007-Nov. 3 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4436263","isNumber":"4436631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4436263","xplore-issue":"4436631","articleId":"4436721","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4436737,"authors":[{"name":"Yuxuan Zhang","affiliation":["University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Yuxuan Zhang","id":"37292447400"},{"name":"Wai-Hoi Wong","affiliation":["University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Wai-Hoi Wong","id":"37279177800"},{"name":"Shitao Liu","affiliation":["University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Shitao Liu","id":"37292595500"},{"name":"Jiguo Liu","affiliation":["University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Jiguo Liu","id":"37292071300"},{"name":"Soonseok Kim","affiliation":["Crystal Photonics, Inc., Sanford, FL, USA","University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Soonseok Kim","id":"37279277200"},{"name":"Hossain Baghaei","affiliation":["University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Hossain Baghaei","id":"37269499700"},{"name":"Hongdi Li","affiliation":["University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Hongdi Li","id":"37281093100"},{"name":"Rocio Ramirez","affiliation":["University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Rocio","lastName":"Ramirez","id":"37269150700"},{"name":"Yu Wang","affiliation":["Schlumberger, Sugar Land, TX, USA","University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Yu Wang","id":"37281431400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0922-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0923-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3654"}],"articleNumber":"4436737","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Positron emission tomography","Image resolution","Image quality","Design optimization","Detectors","Geometry","Cameras","Animals","Imaging phantoms","Sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical equipment","brain","image resolution","image sampling","medical image processing","Monte Carlo methods","optimisation","phantoms","positron emission tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PET resolution","image quality optimization","detector block geometries","DOI designs","point source resolution curves","Derenzo-like hot-rod phantom images","Monte Carlo simulations","human brain PET","animal PET","radial samplings","axial samplings","nonHCO block","high-resolution PET camera design","detector ring diameter","crystal sizes","1-layer geometries","2-layer geometries","half-crystal-offset block","F-18 source","depth-of-interaction effect","size 480 mm","size 160 mm","size 40 mm","size 20 mm","size 10 mm"]}],"abstract":"Detector geometry for PET camera is one of the most important factors that will determine the resolution and image quality of the camera. In this work, the point source resolutions and hot-rod phantom images of the PET systems with different detector geometries are studied using Monte Carlo simulations. The PET systems been studied include a human brain PET and an animal PET with the typical detector ring dimensions but different crystal sizes, number of layers and block geometries. The detector ring diameter is 480 mm for the brain PET and 160 mm for the animal PET. The blocks been studied include 1-layer and 2-layer geometries. Two types of 2- layer blocks are studied, one has a half-crystal-offset (HCO) between the top and bottom layers to double the radial and axial samplings, and the other one is the regular (non-HCO) 2-layer block. The blocks in the brain PET is 40times40times20 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n and with a crystal matrix of 10times10, 13times13 and 15times15; the block in the animal PET is 20times20times10 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n and with a crystal matrix of 10times10, 12times12 and 14times14. Point source resolution curves (radial, tangential and axial) as the function of off-center distance are obtained with an F-18 source. Two Derenzo-like hot-rod phantoms are used for overall image quality test. The results show the significant improvement on the DOI effect with 2-layer block especially in the radial direction. Using the HCO block, the transaxial resolution is a little better than that of non-HCO block in the center region of the FOV but become worse with some distance from the center because of the sampling rates in different radial offset positions are not the same for these two types of blocks. Another important finding is that the axial resolution with HCO block is much better than that from 1- layer or 2-layer non-HCO block. Therefore using HCO block with larger crystal pitch can still achieve better image quality not only in transaxial plane at the outside region of a large FOV compare to the small crystal pitch with 1-layer block, but also better resolution in axial direction without additional cost, which might be a better choice for high-resolution PET camera design.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2007.4436737","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel5/4436263/4436631/04436737.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2007.4436737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4436631","startPage":"2885","endPage":"2888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PET resolution and image quality optimization study for different detector block geometries and DOI designs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4436737","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PET resolution and image quality optimization study for different detector block geometries and DOI designs","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 26 2007-Nov. 3 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4436737/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26 Oct.-3 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9891690","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4436737/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PET resolution and image quality optimization study for different detector block geometries and DOI designs","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01162008-00106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105485S","chronDate":"Oct. 26 2007-Nov. 3 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4436263","isNumber":"4436631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4436263","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4436631","articleId":"4436737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4436755,"authors":[{"name":"Mahua Bhattacharya","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management, Gwalior, India"],"firstName":"Mahua","lastName":"Bhattacharya","id":"37391044500"},{"name":"Arpita Das","affiliation":["Institute of Radio Physics & Electronics, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Arpita","lastName":"Das","id":"38591199000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0922-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0923-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3654"}],"articleNumber":"4436755","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image resolution","Biomedical imaging","Image registration","Mutual information","Genetic algorithms","Medical treatment","Medical diagnostic imaging","Biomedical computing","Computed tomography","Entropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["entropy","genetic algorithms","image registration","image resolution","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical image registration","image resolution","maximization","mutual information","optimization","genetic algorithm","relative entropy","information theory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4436755","abstract":"Biomedical image registration or geometrical alignment of 2-D/2-D image data is increasingly important in diagnosis, treatment planning, computer-guided therapies and in biomedical research. In this paper we present affine registration of same modality images and different (MR & CT) modality images. Automatic registration is achieved by maximization of a similarity metric, which is mutual information (MI) or relative entropy, based on the concept of information theory. Registration based on MI usually requires an optimization technique to achieve correctly aligned images. There exist many optimization schemes, most of which are local and require a starting point. Unfortunately the functions of similarity metric used in the present problem are nonconvex and irregular and therefore global methods are often required. In this paper, we have implemented genetic algorithm as an optimization technique to overcome these problems. Experimental results show our algorithm is a robust and efficient method.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2007.4436755","startPage":"2961","endPage":"2964","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2007.4436755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4436631","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel5/4436263/4436631/04436755.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi resolution medical image registration using maximization of mutual information & optimization by genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4436755/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi resolution medical image registration using maximization of mutual information & optimization by genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4436755/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9891708","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","conferenceDate":"26 Oct.-3 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 26 2007-Nov. 3 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi resolution medical image registration using maximization of mutual information & optimization by genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01162008-00124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067098S","chronDate":"Oct. 26 2007-Nov. 3 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4436263","isNumber":"4436631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4436263","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4436631","articleId":"4436755","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4436798,"authors":[{"name":"Michael D.

This, combined with FPGA's low expense and ease of use, make them an ideal technology for pulse timing and are a central part of our next generation of electronics for our pre-clinical PET scanner systems. To that end, our laboratory has been developing a pulse timing technique that uses pulse fitting to achieve timing resolution well below the sampling period of the analog to digital converter (ADC). While ADCs with sampling rates in excess of 400 MS/s exist, we feel that using ADCs with lowing sampling rates has many advantages for positron emission tomography (PET) scanners. It is with this premise that we have started simulating timing algorithms using MATLAB in order to optimize the parameters before implementing the algorithm in Verilog. MATLAB simulations allow us to quickly investigate filter designs, ADC sampling rates and algorithms with real data before implementation in hardware. We report our results for a least squares fitting algorithm and a new version of a leading edge detector of PMT pulses.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2007.4436798","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Nuclear

Upcoming research protocols ask for low doses, submillimeter resolution, high sensitivity and multimodality. Current scanner technologies are mainly based on analog ASICs having a long design-cycle which hinders rapid scanner improvements and can hardly keep up with the new requirements of biomedical research. With new high-speed processors and configurable electronics, combined with early digitization of the signals from detectors, digital signal processing can flexibly and concurrently deal with many of those requirements. The present paper highlights past, present and foreseen developments in PET/CT signal processing. In particular, different model fits, filtered interpolation and neural networks are compared for timestamping and pulse shape discrimination. Recursive (ARMAX, AR...) and non recursive (Wiener, Fast Fourier transforms, Wavelets...) filtering are compared for crystal identification. Advanced pile-up correction, baseline restoration and energy measurement in photon-counting CT are also discussed. Finally, new techniques dealing with realtime event processing for Compton-scatter LOR computation and alternate random estimation will be briefly introduced.

Sensitivity can be increased by lowering the energy threshold to include more Compton-scattered events, but then computation of the correct annihilation line-of-response (LOR) proves problematic. The complexity of Compton-kinematics analysis, compounded with finite energy resolution and detection position quantization of finite-size detectors, yields unaffordable methods with rather poor success rates. As an alternative, this paper proposes an artificial neural network (ANN) approach, which forfeits all explicit handling of equations at the expense of a priori statistical training, and which has the potential to better handle the previous measurement impairments. The method first consists in a preprocessing step involving geometrical transformations, which simplifies the actual use of the neural network, in the second step. This paper presents the method's proof-of-concept. It focuses on a simple yet prevalent inter-crystal scatter scenario, where a 511-keV annihilation photon is detected coincidently with two inter-crystal-scattered photons whose energy sum accounts for the whole 511 keV annihilation energy. It shows, in preliminary simulations, a promising correct LOR computation rate in the range from 90 to 94%. Finally, it discusses the steps and requirements for the eventual implementation of the method, including further validation, hardware requirements, system- level issues and possible other applications.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2007.4436902","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel5/4436263/4436808/04436902.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2007.4436902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4436808","startPage":"3594","endPage":"3600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensitivity in PET: Neural networks as an alternative to compton photons LOR analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4436902","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity in PET: Neural networks as an alternative to compton photons LOR analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 26 2007-Nov. 3 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4436902/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26 Oct.-3 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9891839","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4436902/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity in PET: Neural networks as an alternative to compton photons LOR analysis","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01162008-00094.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118915S","chronDate":"Oct. 26 2007-Nov. 3 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4436263","isNumber":"4436808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4436263","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4436808","articleId":"4436902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4437030,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher C.

Current clinical systems based on LYSO have timing resolutions near 600 ps (FWHM), but considerably better resolution is possible with faster scintillators. Bench top measurements have indicated that the LaBr3 modules used in a proto-type TOF PET scanner should allow for a resolution of 315-330 ps. To achieve the best system timing resolution a new \"local\" triggering scheme has been developed, in which the seven PMTs used for energy and positioning determination are also used to produce a trigger. The electronics use fast components, and have been found to introduce a timing jitter of less than 50 ps. The local triggering design reduces the effects of pulse pileup and dark current noise, greatly reducing the degradation of the timing resolution at higher rates. With these new electronics we have achieved a system time resolution of 420 ps with little degradation at the rates expected for clinical FDG studies. The combination of the continuous design of our scanner and the local triggering scheme makes this design concept scalable to any configuration of PMTs in a full PET scanner.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2007.4437030","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel5/4436263/4437000/04437030.pdf","startPage":"4123","endPage":"4128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2007.4437030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4437000","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4437030","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Timing measurements from a TOF-PET scanner using local PMT triggering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Timing measurements from a TOF-PET scanner using local PMT triggering","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4437030/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 26 2007-Nov. 3 2007","isConference":true,"volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4437030/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9891951","conferenceDate":"26 Oct.-3 Nov. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Timing measurements from a TOF-PET scanner using local PMT triggering","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01152008-00030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0469S","chronDate":"Oct. 26 2007-Nov. 3 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4436263","isNumber":"4437000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4436263","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4437000","articleId":"4437030","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-21"},{"_id":4437031,"authors":[{"name":"Kathleen Vunckx","affiliation":["Department of Nuclear Medicine, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Kathleen","lastName":"Vunckx","id":"37295698400"},{"name":"Lin Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Nuclear Medicine, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"lastName":"Lin Zhou","id":"37087810173"},{"name":"Samuel Matej","affiliation":["Department of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Samuel","lastName":"Matej","id":"37268307100"},{"name":"Michel Defrise","affiliation":["Department of Nuclear Medicine, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"Defrise","id":"37268069600"},{"name":"Johan Nuyts","affiliation":["Department of Nuclear Medicine, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Johan","lastName":"Nuyts","id":"37268333300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0922-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0923-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3654"}],"articleNumber":"4437031","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image quality","Positron emission tomography","Image reconstruction","Image analysis","Information analysis","Image resolution","Pixel","Imaging phantoms","Kernel","Software quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","maximum likelihood estimation","medical image processing","phantoms","positron emission tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fisher information","image quality","time-of-flight PET","image reconstruction","post-filtered maximum likelihood expectation maximization","phantoms","contrast-to-noise ratio"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4437031","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2007.4437031","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2007.4437031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4437000","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel5/4436263/4437000/04437031.pdf","startPage":"4129","endPage":"4136","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fisher information-based evaluation of image quality for time-of-flight PET","abstract":"The use of time-of-flight (TOF) information during reconstruction is generally considered to improve the image quality. In this work we quantified this improvement using two existing methods: (1) a very simple analytical expression only valid for a central point in a large uniform disk source, and (2) efficient analytical approximations for post-filtered maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) reconstruction with a fixed target resolution, predicting the image quality in a pixel or in a small region based on the Fisher information matrix. The image quality was investigated at different locations in various software phantoms. Simplified as well as realistic phantoms, measured both with TOF positron emission tomography (PET) systems and with a conventional PET system, were simulated. Since the time resolution of the system is not always accurately known, the effect on the image quality of using an inaccurate kernel during reconstruction was also examined with the Fisher information-based method. First, we confirmed with this method that the variance improvement in the center of a large uniform disk source is proportional to the disk diameter and inversely proportional to the time resolution. Next, image quality improvement was observed in all pixels, but in eccentric and high-count regions the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) increased slower than in central and low- or medium-count regions. Finally, the CNR was seen to decrease when the time resolution was inaccurately modeled (too narrow or too wide) during reconstruction. Although the optimum is rather flat, using an inaccurate TOF kernel might introduce artifacts in the reconstructed image.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4437031/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 26 2007-Nov. 3 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26 Oct.-3 Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4437031/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9891952","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fisher information-based evaluation of image quality for time-of-flight PET","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fisher information-based evaluation of image quality for time-of-flight PET","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01152008-00031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060249S","chronDate":"Oct. 26 2007-Nov. 3 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4436263","isNumber":"4437000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4436263","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4437000","articleId":"4437031","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4437034,"authors":[{"name":"Johan Nuyts","affiliation":["Nuclear Medicine, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Johan","lastName":"Nuyts","id":"37268333300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0922-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0923-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3654"}],"articleNumber":"4437034","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":468},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4437034","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mutual information","Joints","Entropy","Histograms","Whole-body PET","Image reconstruction","Clustering algorithms","Brain modeling","Computed tomography","Image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain","entropy","image reconstruction","maximum likelihood estimation","medical image processing","positron emission tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mutual information","joint entropy","emission tomography","maximum-a-posteriori reconstruction","whole body PET-CT scan","PET brain scan","MRI-scan","off-line registration","anatomical priors","gradient ascent algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2007.4437034","pdfPath":"/iel5/4436263/4437000/04437034.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","startPage":"4149","endPage":"4154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4437000","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2007.4437034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The use of mutual information and joint entropy for anatomical priors in emission tomography","abstract":"This paper studies the use of mutual information and joint entropy to define anatomical priors for maximum-a- posteriori (MAP) reconstruction in emission tomography.

The card's main purpose is to condition, digitize and process incoming analog pulses from PMT or APD based PET or SPECT detectors. Analog pulses from a detector are digitized using a 100 MHz continuous sampling ADC and read into a Xilinx Virtex II Pro FPGA for processing. The FPGA performs digital integration, baseline offset correction and pileup rejection. Because these functions are done in the digital domain, different algorithms can be quickly re-implemented and tested. The EPM has the ability to capture raw event ADC samples, allowing for the quick development and comparison of new algorithms in software on actual event samples. The Inveontrade small animal PET scanner uses a larger LSO block detector and new analog front end than previous generation scanners which increases the likelihood of pileup events. The digital pulse processing methods presented here have been evaluated to obtain the best energy and positioning performance from the high pixel count Inveontrade detectors while maintaining high stability across countrates.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4437000","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2007.4437058","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel5/4436263/4437000/04437058.pdf","startPage":"4262","endPage":"4265","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2007.4437058","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuously sampled digital pulse processing for inveon small animal PET scanner","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 26 2007-Nov. 3 2007","displayDocTitle":"Continuously sampled digital pulse processing for inveon small animal PET scanner","isConference":true,"volume":"6","conferenceDate":"26 Oct.-3 Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4437058/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9891979","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4437058/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuously sampled digital pulse processing for inveon small animal PET scanner","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01152008-00058.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042842S","chronDate":"Oct. 26 2007-Nov. 3 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4436263","isNumber":"4437000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4436263","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4437000","articleId":"4437058","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4437060,"authors":[{"name":"Qingguo Xie","affiliation":["Department of Radiology, University of Chicago, IL, USA","Biomedical Engineering Department, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Qingguo","lastName":"Xie","id":"37272284800"},{"name":"Chien-Min Kao","affiliation":["Department of Radiology, University of Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Chien-Min","lastName":"Kao","id":"37275757000"},{"name":"Xi Wang","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Department, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407494300"},{"name":"Ning Guo","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Department, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Guo","id":"37671014300"},{"name":"Caigang Zhu","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Department, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Caigang","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37830906400"},{"name":"Henry Frisch","affiliation":["Enrico Fermi Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Henry","lastName":"Frisch","id":"37296063100"},{"name":"William W.

A novel cost function is defined to facilitate the control strategy over both the time-domain and the frequency-domain specifications.

Simulation results using 3.3 V supply voltage, 128 code length and 50 MHz operating speed reveals that using the proposed circuit, the receiver in CDMA bus interface works well with wide input range and good linearity.","doi":"10.1109/IDT.2007.4437458","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd International Design and Test Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd International Design and Test Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4437402/4437403/04437458.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IDT.2007.4437458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4437403","startPage":"193","endPage":"197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An auto-Sensitivity Control Circuit Using Analog Topology for Wired CDMA Bus Interface","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4437458","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An auto-Sensitivity Control Circuit Using Analog Topology for Wired CDMA Bus Interface","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4437458/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9765907","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4437458/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An auto-Sensitivity Control Circuit Using Analog Topology for Wired CDMA Bus Interface","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"IDT-00-55.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031536S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4437402","isNumber":"4437403","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4437402","xplore-issue":"4437403","articleId":"4437458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4437459,"authors":[{"name":"Mostafa Aly Refay Eltokhy","affiliation":["Electronics Technology Department, Industrial Education College, Helwan University, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Mostafa Aly Refay","lastName":"Eltokhy","id":"37284088500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1824-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1825-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-0601"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-061X"}],"articleNumber":"4437459","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switching circuits","Correlators","Charge pumps","Multiaccess communication","Voltage","Switches","Capacitors","Capacitance","Bandwidth","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","field buses","power supply circuits","switched capacitor networks","telecommunication power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switched-capacitor analog correlator","balanced charge pump circuit","CDMA bus interface","code division multiple access bus interface","charge injection","frequency 100 MHz","voltage 3.3 V"]}],"abstract":"A switched-capacitor analog correlator using balanced charge pump circuit, capable of pumping same amount of charge in positive and negative direction is proposed for code division multiple access (CDMA) bus interface.

Today's preferred technical solution is optical time-of-flight (TOF) range imaging, due to its simplicity, its distance resolution, its large and adaptable measurement range, as well as the absence of shadowing problems. In order significantly to extend the application areas of TOF 3-D cameras, in particular for outdoor use, we show how their performance can be improved in all relevant respects: background light suppression is improved by an order of magnitude by the minimum charge transfer method. Multicamera operation is achieved by a binary pseudo-noise modulation/demodulation technique. This method also avoids all practical ambiguity problems typically encountered with harmonic modulation. Higher temporal demodulation resolution becomes possible with a pixel structure employing lateral electric fields. We have realized such pixels with a commercially available CCD/CMOS process, and our measurement results confirm that gigahertz demodulation imaging is possible. The practicality of all theoretical concepts is demonstrated with a miniaturized TOF 3-D camera platform whose LED array light source is modulated at a typical rate of 20 MHz. Our work contributes, therefore, to opening up new application domains of the soaring optical TOF range imaging techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4437478/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4437478/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10117082","volume":"55","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust Optical Time-of-Flight Range Imaging Based on Smart Pixel Structures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Optical Time-of-Flight Range Imaging Based on Smart Pixel Structures","sourcePdf":"55tcsi06-buttgen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098816S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4563499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"4563499","articleId":"4437478","onlineDate":"02 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4437479,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Rong Lee","affiliation":["Western Australian Centre of Excellence in Industrial Optimisation, Department of Mathematics andStatistics, Curtin University of Technology, Perth, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4539047/4437479/4437479-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Rong Lee received the Ph.D. degree in applied mathematics from Curtin University of Technology, Perth, WA, Australia, in 1999.","From 1999 to 2001, he worked as a Research Associate in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Curtin University of Technology.

The constrained optimization problem thus formulated is converted to an unconstrained least-squares (LS) optimization problem which is highly nonlinear. However, it can be approximated by a linear LS optimization problem which in turn simply requires the solution of a linear system. The proposed method can efficiently minimize the total error energy of the fractional group delay while maintaining constraints on the level of the error energy of the phase response. To make the error distribution as flat as possible, a weighted LS (WLS) design method is also developed. An error weighting function is obtained according to the solution of the previous constrained LS design. The maximum peak error is then further reduced by an iterative updating of the error weighting function. Numerical examples are included in order to compare the performance of the filters designed using the proposed methods with those designed by several existing methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4437479/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 June 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","volume":"55","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2008","accessionNumber":"10050666","publicationDate":"June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4437479/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal Design of All-Pass Variable Fractional-Delay Digital Filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Design of All-Pass Variable Fractional-Delay Digital Filters","sourcePdf":"55tcsi05-lee3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095556S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4539047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4539047","articleId":"4437479","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4437480,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Kun Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, HsinChu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Kun","lastName":"Lin","id":"37292134900"},{"name":"Chia-Chun Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, HsinChu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Chun","lastName":"Lin","id":"37291399000"},{"name":"Tzu-Yun Kuo","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, HsinChu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tzu-Yun","lastName":"Kuo","id":"37290475700"},{"name":"Tian-Sheuan Chang","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, HsinChu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tian-Sheuan","lastName":"Chang","id":"37292028800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-8328"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0806"}],"articleNumber":"4437480","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":698},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic voltage control","High definition video","Bandwidth","HDTV","Video coding","Costs","TV","Motion estimation","Hardware","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital integrated circuits","integrated circuit design","motion estimation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["H.264/AVC video coding","motion estimation","fractional-pel ME","integer-pel ME","high-definition video","serial multiresolution search","cycle count reduction","integrated circuit design","frequency 128.8 MHz","size 0.13 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital circuits","high-definition television (HDTV)","H.264","motion estimation (ME)","video coding","video signal processing"]},{"kwd":["H.264","motion estimation","HDTV","digital circuits","video coding","video signal processing"]}],"abstract":"Motion estimation (ME) in high-definition H.264 video coding presents a significant design challenge for memory bandwidth, latency, and cost because of its large search range and various modes. To conquer this problem, this paper presents a low-latency and hardware-efficient ME design with three design techniques. The first technique on integer-pel ME (IME) adopts parallel instead of serial multiresolution search so that we can process 1080 p @ 60 fps videos with plusmn128 search range within just 256 cycles, 5.95-KB buffers, and 213.7 K gates. The second technique on fractional-pel ME (FME) uses a single-iteration six-point search to reduce the cycle count by half with similar gate count and negligible quality loss. The third technique applies a mode-filtering approach to further reduce the bandwidth and cycles and share the buffer of IME and FME. The final ME implementation with 0.13-mum process can support processing of 1080 p @ 60 fps with just 128.8 MHz, 282.6 K gates, and 8.54-KB buffer, which saves 60% gate count, and 68.9% SRAM buffers when compared with the previous design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hardware-Efficient H.264/AVC Motion-Estimation Design for High-Definition Video","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.916681","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4563499/04437480.pdf","startPage":"1526","endPage":"1535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.916681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4563499","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4437480","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4437480/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Hardware-Efficient H.264/AVC Motion-Estimation Design for High-Definition Video","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10117083","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hardware-Efficient H.264/AVC Motion-Estimation Design for High-Definition Video","sourcePdf":"55tcsi06-lin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060442S","chronDate":"July  2008","isNumber":"4563499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"45","articleId":"4437480","onlineDate":"02 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4437481,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Maffezzoni","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4539047/4437481/4437481-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Paolo Maffezzoni (M'08) received the Laurea degree (with highest honors) in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electronic instrumentation from Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, in 1991, and 1996, respectively","In 1998, he joined the Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, as an Assistant Professor.

Using our analysis, all of the circuit currents and voltages and, hence, the power dissipation in each component is calculated as a function of a key design parameter, denoted by \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">x</i>\n. This parameter is the ratio of the resonance frequency of the shunt inductor and shunt capacitor to the operating frequency. We have shown that there is a limited continues range for this parameter, in which class E operation with realizable circuit is achieved. Three conventional design methods, namely infinite dc feed, parallel circuit, and even harmonic design methods are the special cases, corresponding to a certain value of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">x</i>\n. Our analysis explains the power efficiency, the power capability, and other characteristics of the class E power amplifier circuit as a function of the parameter \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">x</i>\n. We have developed new design formulas that give the values of the circuit components for each value of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">x</i>\n. These equations enable the designer to analytically optimize the circuit for a desired performance measure, such as power efficiency or power capability. To obtain the optimum design, the shunt inductor quality factor and the switch on-state resistance must be given. Then, one can find the value of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">x</i>\n corresponding to the optimum value of the given performance measure. The analysis results show that the power efficiency is better a optimization measure than power capability. To assess the analysis results and to compare the new design method with the conventional methods, we have used the foundry design kit for STMicroelectronics 90-nm global-purpose CMOS process. For this purpose, we have designed four identical class E power amplifiers, one using the parallel-circuit method, another with the even-harmonic method, and two others with the proposed design method. One of the latter has been optimized for maximum power capability and the other for maximum power efficiency. The designed power amplifiers have been simulated in the foundry design kit and the simulation results prove the accuracy of the analysis and reveal the usefulness of our design method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4437506/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4437506/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10117073","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Optimum Design of a Class E RF Power Amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Optimum Design of a Class E RF Power Amplifier","sourcePdf":"55tcsi06-hasani.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077166S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4563499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4563499","articleId":"4437506","onlineDate":"02 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4437511,"authors":[{"name":"Joshua D.

A full account of SRAM cell stability requires dynamic noise margin models that take into account the temporal behavior of noise injection mechanism. One critical component of dynamic noise margin analysis is the determination of stability boundary, or the separatrix. Different from the unrealistic assumption made in prior work, we show that the separatrix is subject to significant perturbation due to device mismatch and hence must be carefully accounted for in noise margin analysis. More importantly, by applying a rigorous nonlinear system theory, we present an efficient separatrix tracing technique that can accurately determine the separatrix via fast transistor-level transient simulation. The presented technique is shown to be up to thousands times faster than a brute-force approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4437516/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4437516/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9777009","conferenceDate":"20-21 Sept. 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Tracing SRAM separatrix for dynamic noise margin analysis under device mismatch","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracing SRAM separatrix for dynamic noise margin analysis under device mismatch","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01172008-00003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06538S","chronDate":"20-21 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4437512","isNumber":"4437513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4437512","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4437513","articleId":"4437516","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4437523,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Joeres","affiliation":["Integrated Analog Circuits, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Joeres","id":"37564991300"},{"name":"Hans-Werner Groh","affiliation":["Atmel Germany GmbH, Heilbronn, Germany"],"firstName":"Hans-Werner","lastName":"Groh","id":"37679569000"},{"name":"Stefan Heinen","affiliation":["Integrated Analog Circuits, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Heinen","id":"37269356200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1567-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-3804"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-3812"}],"articleNumber":"4437523","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":394},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Event driven analog modeling of RF frontends","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","RF signals","Hardware design languages","Digital simulation","Bluetooth","Transceivers","Sampling methods","Analog-digital conversion","Passband","Baseband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue integrated circuits","Bluetooth","circuit simulation","hardware description languages","integrated circuit modelling","integrated circuit testing","radiofrequency integrated circuits","sampling methods","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["event driven analog modeling","RF frontends","VerilogAMS modeling language","digital simulation domain","LO signal flow path","Bluetooth transceiver system","nonuniform oversampling","integrated circuit verification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Modeling","VerilogAMS","wreal","nonuniform sampling"]}],"abstract":"The modeling language VerilogAMS supports a new double precision datatype (wreal) that enables analog accuracy in the digital simulation domain. It is therefore possible to separate high frequency signal paths, like those in RF frontends, from the rest of the chip, which comes in very handy for fast verification purposes. After an introduction to analog and digital modeling, a strategy to model the RF and LO signal flow path for a bluetooth transceiver system is presented. Especially the nonuniform oversampling, which is introduced through wreal to electrical and vice versa conversion, is analyzed and compared to traditional uniform sampling ratios. The proposed approach is demonstrated for an industrial available RF frontend, including biasing and analog to digital conversion. Simulation comparisons for different complexities of the frontend and different modeling approaches like passband, baseband and transistor level conclude the paper.","doi":"10.1109/BMAS.2007.4437523","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Behavioral Modeling and Simulation Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Behavioral Modeling and Simulation Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4437512/4437513/04437523.pdf","startPage":"46","endPage":"51","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4437513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMAS.2007.4437523","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4437523","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4437523/","displayDocTitle":"Event driven analog modeling of RF frontends","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9777016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4437523/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","conferenceDate":"20-21 Sept. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event driven analog modeling of RF frontends","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01172008-00010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040465S","chronDate":"20-21 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4437512","isNumber":"4437513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4437512","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4437513","articleId":"4437523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":4437531,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey Fan","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Fan","id":"37287543100"},{"name":"Guofen Yu","affiliation":["Department of Physics, University of Findlay, Findlay, OH, USA"],"lastName":"Guofen Yu","id":"37087297309"},{"name":"Jichang Tan","affiliation":["Department of CS and IE, Saint John''s University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jichang Tan","id":"37087297390"},{"name":"Sheldon X.-D.

The motivation is based on the known characteristics of biological cells. By applying an electric pulse with a fixed duration, we may calculate the voltage across the cytoplasmic membrane, also called a cell membrane or plasma membrane, and the nuclear membrane within biological cells. The induced voltage across the membranes may function like a capacitor does in a DRAM storage element. The electron charge accumulated on a membrane is also leaky, similar to the traditional DRAM. The electron charge and discharge time constants for cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes can be fine-tuned through careful selection of different sizes and types of biological cells. Experimental results by simulation show that about 75 percents (75%) of the applied voltage is distributed across the cytoplasmic membrane. Hence, cytoplasmic membrane is more suitable in the application of DRAM implementation. This means that when applying 0.9 V - 1 V of voltage across a biological cell, roughly 0.7 V - 0.75 V of the voltage is induced across the cytoplasmic membrane. The electron charge and discharge time can be achieved within 100 ns for certain size and type of biological cells. The required DRAM refresh frequency is therefore approximately 10 MHz for such biological cells.","doi":"10.1109/BMAS.2007.4437531","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Behavioral Modeling and Simulation Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Behavioral Modeling and Simulation Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4437512/4437513/04437531.pdf","startPage":"90","endPage":"93","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMAS.2007.4437531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4437513","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4437531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and analysis of biological cells in DRAM implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4437531/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and analysis of biological cells in DRAM implementation","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4437531/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","conferenceDate":"20-21 Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9777024","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and analysis of biological cells in DRAM implementation","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01172008-00018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103487S","chronDate":"20-21 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4437512","isNumber":"4437513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4437512","xplore-issue":"4437513","articleId":"4437531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4437544,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Bo Liao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National I-Lan University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yi-Bo Liao","id":"37532910100"},{"name":"Yan-Kai Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National I-Lan University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yan-Kai Chen","id":"37836231400"},{"name":"Meng-Hsueh Chiang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National I-Lan University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Meng-Hsueh Chiang","id":"37532657000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1567-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-3804"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-3812"}],"articleNumber":"4437544","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":549},"abstract":"In this paper, we successfully develop a compact phase change memory (PCM) model using Verilog-A.

As any kind of memories, embedded Flash (eFlash) can be subjected to complex functional faults that are related to their particular technological process and to their integration density. In this paper, we address a major issue during eFlash testing, namely the test of Address decoder Faults (AFs), which is generally very time consuming with ad-hoc solutions presently used in industry. In the first part of the paper, we show the impact of AFs on the functional behavior of an eFlash. Next, we use an analogy with RAM memory testing to classify AFs with respect to their functional behavior. We then obtain AFs acting either as stuck-at faults or as state coupling faults. In the fourth part of the paper, we propose a concurrent approach for testing AFs acting on either the word line decoder or the bit line decoder. The proposed approach allows using a minimal number of programming operations during test application. Finally, we propose a compaction procedure to further reduce the test time of AFs. As a result, huge reductions in test time can be achieved; experiments on a 4 Mbits eFlash have shown that a test time reduction factor of 34x can be obtained when compared to the global eFlash test flow presently used in industry. An additional important feature of the proposed strategy is that it allows testing 100% of other critical faults in eFlashs (stuck-at, transition and state coupling faults) beside full coverage of AFs.","doi":"10.1109/TEST.2007.4437567","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Test Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Test Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4437545/4437546/04437567.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.2007.4437567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4437546","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4437567","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A concurrent approach for testing address decoder faults in eFlash memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-26 Oct. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4437567/","displayDocTitle":"A concurrent approach for testing address decoder faults in eFlash memories","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4437567/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","conferenceDate":"21-26 Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"10062164","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A concurrent approach for testing address decoder faults in eFlash memories","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01142008-00021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063643S","chronDate":"21-26 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4437545","isNumber":"4437546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4437545","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4437546","articleId":"4437567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4437568,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Lung Su","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chin-Lung Su","id":"37281255100"},{"name":"Chih-Wea Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chih-Wea Tsai","id":"37833234400"},{"name":"Cheng-Wen Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Cheng-Wen Wu","id":"37276423200"},{"name":"Ji-Jan Chen","affiliation":["SOC Technology Center, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ji-Jan Chen","id":"37351180500"},{"name":"Wen-Ching Wu","affiliation":["SOC Technology Center, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wen-Ching Wu","id":"37280430300"},{"name":"Chien-Chung Hung","affiliation":["Electronics Research and Service Org, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chien-Chung Hung","id":"37289819400"},{"name":"Ming-Jer Kao","affiliation":["Electronics Research and Service Org, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ming-Jer Kao","id":"37285787200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1127-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1128-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-3539"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-2250"}],"articleNumber":"4437568","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4437568","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Circuit testing","Built-in self-test","Circuit faults","Logic testing","CMOS technology","Random access memory","Automatic testing","Circuit stability","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self test","CMOS memory circuits","integrated circuit testing","magnetic semiconductors","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic random access memory","MRAM write disturbance fault","adaptive diagnosis algorithm","built-in self-test","linear time complexity","logical test","CMOS technology","memory size 1 MByte","size 0.15 mum"]}],"abstract":"To help improve quality and yield of magnetic random access memory (MRAM), we propose an adaptive diagnosis algorithm (ADA) that can efficiently identify the write disturbance fault (WDF) for MRAM. The proposed test algorithm is a March-based one, i.e., it has linear time complexity and can easily be implemented with built-in self-test (BIST). However, the proposed test method can evaluate the process stability and uniformity using logical test method. We also develop a BIST circuit that supports the proposed WDF diagnosis test method. We propose the BIST scheme based on the decision write mechanism of the toggle MRAM to reduce total test time. A 1 Mb toggle MRAM prototype chip with the proposed BIST circuit has been designed and fabricated using a special 0.15 mum CMOS technology. The BIST circuit overhead is only about 0.04% with respect to the 1 Mb MRAM. The test time is reduced by about 30% as compared with the test method without using the decision write mechanism.","doi":"10.1109/TEST.2007.4437568","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Test Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Test Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4437545/4437546/04437568.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.2007.4437568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4437546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diagnosis for MRAM write disturbance fault","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-26 Oct. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4437568/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-26 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Diagnosis for MRAM write disturbance fault","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4437568/","accessionNumber":"10062165","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diagnosis for MRAM write disturbance fault","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01142008-00022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.125684S","chronDate":"21-26 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4437545","isNumber":"4437546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4437545","xplore-issue":"4437546","articleId":"4437568","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4437584,"authors":[{"name":"Samy Makar","affiliation":["Azul Systems, Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Samy","lastName":"Makar","id":"37330304900"},{"name":"Tony Altinis","affiliation":["Azul Systems, Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Tony","lastName":"Altinis","id":"37831067200"},{"name":"Niteen Patkar","affiliation":["Azul Systems, Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Niteen","lastName":"Patkar","id":"37349811200"},{"name":"Janet Wu","affiliation":["Azul Systems, Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Janet","lastName":"Wu","id":"37834251800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1127-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1128-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-3539"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-2250"}],"articleNumber":"4437584","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":192},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic testing","EPROM","Built-in self-test","Costs","System testing","Automatic test pattern generation","Packaging","Java","Home appliances","Sun"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic test pattern generation","electronic engineering computing","logic testing","microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Vega2 testing","chip multiprocessor","memory macros","spare processor cores","column redundancy","defective processors","ATPG patterns"]}],"abstract":"Vega2 is a CMP (chip multi-processor) with 48 processor cores, and several spare cores to improve yield.

To increase the debug observation window, we propose a novel architecture for embedded logic analysis based on lossless compression. The proposed architecture is particularly useful for in-field debugging of custom circuits that have sources of nondeterministic behavior such as asynchronous interfaces. In order to measure the tradeoff between the area overhead and the increase in the observation window, we also introduce a new compression ratio metric. We use this metric to quantify the performance gain of three lossless compression algorithms suitable for embedded logic analysis.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Test Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4437545/4437546/04437613.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Test Conference","doi":"10.1109/TEST.2007.4437613","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.2007.4437613","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4437546","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4437613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On using lossless compression of debug data in embedded logic analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic","Computer bugs","Silicon","Circuit testing","Compression algorithms","Debugging","Algorithm design and analysis","Manufacturing","Voltage","Performance gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","integrated circuit testing","logic design","semiconductor device manufacture","semiconductor device testing","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lossless compression","debug data","embedded logic analysis","on-chip trace buffer","debug observation window","compression ratio metric"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4437613/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-26 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"On using lossless compression of debug data in embedded logic analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4437613/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"10062114","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","conferenceDate":"21-26 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On using lossless compression of debug data in embedded logic analysis","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01142008-00067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081172S","chronDate":"21-26 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4437545","isNumber":"4437546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4437545","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"4437546","articleId":"4437613","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4437614,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"lastName":"Tao Xu","id":"37411446600"},{"name":"Krishnendu Chakrabarty","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Krishnendu","lastName":"Chakrabarty","id":"37273459000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1127-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1128-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-3539"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-2250"}],"articleNumber":"4437614","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":326},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4437614","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microfluidics","Electrodes","Food manufacturing","Transportation","Proteins","Circuit testing","Application software","Computerized monitoring","Degradation","Biological system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomolecular electronics","microfluidics","testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["functional testing","digital microfluidic biochips","dependability","safety-critical application","point-of-care health assessment","air-quality monitoring","food-safety testing","droplet dispensing","droplet transportation","mixing","splitting","capacitive sensing"]}],"abstract":"Dependability is an important attribute for microfluidic biochips that are used for safety-critical applications such as point-of-care health assessment, air-quality monitoring, and food-safety testing. Therefore, these devices must be adequately tested after manufacture and during bioassay operations. Known techniques for biochip testing are all function-oblivious, i.e., while they can detect and locate defect sites on a microfluidic array, they cannot be used to ensure correct operation of functional units. In this paper, we introduce the concept of functional testing of microfluidic biochips. We address fundamental biochip operations such as droplet dispensing, droplet transportation, mixing, splitting, and capacitive sensing. Long electrode actuation times are avoided to ensure that there is no electrode degradation during testing. We evaluate the proposed test methods using simulations as well as experiments for a fabricated biochip.","doi":"10.1109/TEST.2007.4437614","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Test Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Test Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4437545/4437546/04437614.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.2007.4437614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4437546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Functional testing of digital microfluidic biochips","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4437614/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-26 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Functional testing of digital microfluidic biochips","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"10062115","htmlLink":"/document/4437614/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","conferenceDate":"21-26 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Functional testing of digital microfluidic biochips","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01142008-00068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068178S","chronDate":"21-26 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4437545","isNumber":"4437546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4437545","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4437546","articleId":"4437614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4437621,"authors":[{"name":"Dean L.

Recent research thrusts in 3D-integrated microprocessor design have demonstrated significant improvements in both power consumption and performance. However, this technology is currently being held back due to the lack of test technology. Because processor functionality is partitioned across different silicon die layers, only partial circuitry exists on each layer pre-bond. In current 3D manufacturing, layers in the die stack are simply bonded together to form the complete processor; no testing is performed at the pre-bond stage. Such a strategy leads to an exponential decay in the yield of the final product and places an economic limit on the number of die that can be stacked. To overcome this limit, pre-bond test is a necessity. In this paper, we present a technique to enable pre-bond test in each layer. Further, we address several issues with integrating this new test hardware into the final design. Finally, we use a sample 3D floorplan based on the Alpha 21264 to show that our technique can be implemented at a minimal cost (0.2% area overhead). Our design for pre-bond testability enables the structural test necessary to continue 3D integration for microprocessors beyond a few layers.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Test Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4437545/4437546/04437621.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Test Conference","doi":"10.1109/TEST.2007.4437621","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.2007.4437621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4437546","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4437621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A scanisland based design enabling prebond testability in die-stacked microprocessors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microprocessors","Circuit testing","Stacking","Energy consumption","Silicon","Manufacturing processes","Bonding","Performance evaluation","Power generation economics","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design for testability","integrated circuit yield","microassembling","microprocessor chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scan-island design","prebond testability","die-stacked microprocessors","3D-integrated microprocessor design","processor functionality","3D manufacturing","exponential decay","integrated citcuit yield"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design-For-Testability","Die Stacking","3D integration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4437621/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-26 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A scanisland based design enabling prebond testability in die-stacked microprocessors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4437621/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"10062125","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","conferenceDate":"21-26 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A scanisland based design enabling prebond testability in die-stacked microprocessors","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01142008-00075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082764S","chronDate":"21-26 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4437545","isNumber":"4437546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4437545","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4437546","articleId":"4437621","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4437638,"authors":[{"name":"Shideh Shahidi","affiliation":["Department of EE Systems, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shideh","lastName":"Shahidi","id":"37831140000"},{"name":"Sandeep K.

Error rate, defined as the percentage of clock cycles for which the value at a circuit's outputs deviates from the corresponding error-free value, has been identified as a key measure of error severity. In error-rate testing, every fault that causes error rate greater than a threshold specified by the application is called an unacceptable fault; all other faults are called acceptable. The objective of error-rate testing is to detect every unacceptable fault while detecting none, or a minimum number, of the acceptable faults. In this paper we present a test generator for combinational circuits with the objective of detecting every unacceptable fault while minimizing the number of acceptable faults detected. Our test generator embodies new algorithms and cost functions that capture the properties of acceptable and unacceptable faults. Via experiments on several benchmarks we show that our approach can provide coverage of all unacceptable faults (high test quality) while significantly reducing the number of acceptable faults detected (high acceptance rate). In this manner, our approach helps improve yield via error-rate testing.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4437546","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Test Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Test Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4437545/4437546/04437638.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TEST.2007.4437638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.2007.4437638","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ERTG: A test generator for error-rate testing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-26 Oct. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4437638/","displayDocTitle":"ERTG: A test generator for error-rate testing","htmlLink":"/document/4437638/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-26 Oct. 2007","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10062142","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ERTG: A test generator for error-rate testing","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01142008-00092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068531S","chronDate":"21-26 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4437545","isNumber":"4437546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4437545","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4437546","articleId":"4437638","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4437641,"authors":[{"name":"Erkan Acar","affiliation":["Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Erkan","lastName":"Acar","id":"37298264800"},{"name":"Sule Ozev","affiliation":["Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Sule","lastName":"Ozev","id":"37275335200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1127-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1128-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-3539"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-2250"}],"articleNumber":"4437641","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":327},"abstract":"As radio frequency (RF) devices become more complex and the integration levels increase, their testing becomes more challenging. In order to guarantee successful operation and compliance to certain specifications, measurement of a large number performance parameters under the prescribed operation conditions is needed. Such detailed characterization typically necessitates long test times and expensive instrumentation, increasing the test cost. In this paper, we present a low cost test methodology that determines the RF device's vital performance parameters, such as path gain, IIP\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sub>\n, quadrature imbalances, noise, bit error rate (BER), and error vector magnitude (EVM) through a single test setup. The proposed test methodology is applicable for both single carrier systems and multi-carrier systems. Simulation and measurement results indicate that these performance parameters can be calculated and estimated accurately through a single test set-up and using a shorter test sequence than required by traditional techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Test Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4437545/4437546/04437641.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Test Conference","doi":"10.1109/TEST.2007.4437641","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.2007.4437641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4437546","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4437641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low cost characterization of RF transceivers through IQ data analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","Radio frequency","Transceivers","Data analysis","Circuit testing","Bit error rate","Instruments","System testing","RF signals","Performance gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conformance testing","integrated circuit testing","radiofrequency integrated circuits","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF transceivers","IQ data analysis","low cost test methodology","performance parameters","single carrier systems","multi-carrier systems","single test set-up","test sequence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4437641/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-26 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Low cost characterization of RF transceivers through IQ data analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4437641/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"10062145","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","conferenceDate":"21-26 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low cost characterization of RF transceivers through IQ data analysis","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01142008-00095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066396S","chronDate":"21-26 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4437545","isNumber":"4437546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4437545","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4437546","articleId":"4437641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4437642,"authors":[{"name":"Koji Asami","affiliation":["Advantest Corporation"],"lastName":"Koji Asami","id":"37340102800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1127-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1128-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-3539"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-2250"}],"articleNumber":"4437642","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":215},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","Testing","Gain measurement","Phase measurement","Demodulation","RF signals","Wireless communication","Performance evaluation","Arm","Displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","circuit testing","UHF mixers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband quadrature mixers","wideband wireless communications","carrier phase offset","gain mismatch","IQ skew","high volume production testing","quadrature mixer gain imbalance"]}],"abstract":"As wide-band wireless communications become increasingly prevalent, evaluation of balance among quadrature mixer ports, in terms of carrier phase offset, gain mismatch, and IQ skew, becomes essential.

For this reason, test is often performed using a composite value, without separation of error factors.

In all of them, the main change consists of adding a fourth leg, which is based on the flying-capacitor converter structure. The aim of this additional leg is to provide the converter with fault tolerance. Furthermore, during normal operation mode, this leg is able to provide a stiff neutral voltage. Consequently, the low-frequency voltage oscillations that appear at the neutral point of the standard three-level topology in some operating conditions no longer exist. As a result, the modulation strategy of the three main legs of the converter does not have to take care of voltage balance, and it can be designed to either achieve optimal output voltage spectra or improve the efficiency of the converter. Simulation and experimental results are presented to show the viability of this approach both under normal operation mode and in the event of faults.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.917072","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4459824/04437733.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.917072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459824","startPage":"982","endPage":"995","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-Level Converter Topologies With Switch Breakdown Fault-Tolerance Capability","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4437733","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Three-Level Converter Topologies With Switch Breakdown Fault-Tolerance Capability","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4437733/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 March 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9897225","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4437733/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-Level Converter Topologies With Switch Breakdown Fault-Tolerance Capability","sourcePdf":"55tie03-ceballos.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103485S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4459824","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"4459824","articleId":"4437733","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4437734,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Wei Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4459824/4437734/4437734-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yun Wei Li (S'04\u2013M'06) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 2002 and the Ph.D. degree from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2006.","In 2005, he was a Visiting Scholar with the Institute of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.

To provide a synchronized PWM and achieve the best harmonic performance, different space vector sequences suitable for a current-source converter are investigated in this paper. Details on how to achieve the waveform symmetries with a minimum switching frequency for each sequence are discussed. A thorough comparison of the harmonic performance of different space vector sequences is carried out. An optimum space vector modulation method by switching between two best sequences is proposed to achieve the best line-current total harmonic distortion with reduced switching losses. In addition, two synchronization methods, namely a PWM frame regulation method and a direct digital phase-locked loop synchronization method, are proposed. Both methods are equally effective in providing tight synchronization of the PWM waveform with the rectifier input frequency. The work has been verified in simulation and experiment.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.917073","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4459824/04437734.pdf","startPage":"1022","endPage":"1034","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.917073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459824","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space Vector Sequence Investigation and Synchronization Methods for Active Front-End Rectifiers in High-Power Current-Source Drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4437734","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4437734/","displayDocTitle":"Space Vector Sequence Investigation and Synchronization Methods for Active Front-End Rectifiers in High-Power Current-Source Drives","volume":"55","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9897248","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4437734/","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space Vector Sequence Investigation and Synchronization Methods for Active Front-End Rectifiers in High-Power Current-Source Drives","sourcePdf":"55tie03-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073178S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4459824","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"4459824","articleId":"4437734","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":4437763,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Wu","affiliation":["Ansys Fluent, Inc., Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6040/4447317/4437763/4437763-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xin Wu (M'03) received the B.E. degree from Tsinghua University, in 1996, the M.S. degree from Chinese Academy of Sciences, in 1999, the M.C.E. degree from Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree from University of Maryland, College Park, in 2004.","He is currently a Product Manager at Ansys Inc.

When surface finishes are applied to prevent traces from oxidation, the electrical properties of traces are affected. In this work, experimental study and finite element method (FEM) based full wave simulation are used to investigate the effects of hot air solder leveling (HASL) and its alternatives on signal integrity. Classical interconnect structures, microstrip line, and differential mode coupled microstrip lines subjected to different finishes are investigated. Our work reveals that the net conductor loss that results from surface finishes is the dominant factor in signal degradation when the clock frequency is within the microwave frequency region. For microstrip line, the influence of surface finishes on signal distortion is negligible; for differential mode coupled microstrip lines, however, the surface finish effects, especially those with high resistivity, can lead to significant signal distortions. These findings are expected to have strong implications when designing high-speed circuits that meet strict timing requirements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4437763/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4437763/","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2008","accessionNumber":"9794249","volume":"31","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Surface Finish Effects on High-Speed Signal Degradation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Surface Finish Effects on High-Speed Signal Degradation","sourcePdf":"31tadvp01-wu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108169S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"6040","isNumber":"4447317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6040","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4447317","articleId":"4437763","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4437768,"authors":[{"name":"Pablo Lezana","affiliation":["Departamento de Electricidad, Universidad T\u00e8cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valparaiso, Chile"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4459824/4437768/4437768-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pablo Lezana (S'06\u2013M'07) was born in Temuco, Chile, in 1977.

This parameter, as well as other mechanical variables of the drive system (load side speed, torsional and load torques), are estimated with the use of the developed nonlinear extended Kalman filter (NEKF). The initial values of the Kalman filter covariance matrices are set using the genetic algorithm. Then, to ensure the smallest state and parameter estimation errors, the on-line adaptation law for the chosen element of the state covariance matrix of the NEKF is proposed. The described control strategy is tested in an open and a closed-loop control structure.

In handover, however, key management (i.e., key derivation and key transfer) and mutual authentication form a significant source of latency. Together with the seamlessness requirement 3GPP also requires the reuse of universal subscriber identity module (USIM) and the existing authentication and key management procedure or Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA). In this paper we consider UMTS-AKA and extensible authentication protocol-AKA (EAP-AKA) as the two USIM- based authentication and key management protocols. We propose an architecture that can be used in SAE/LTE for efficient inter-working between UMTS-AKA and EAP-AKA during handover. Efficient inter-working here translates to avoiding signaling with the home domain during handover. Our focus is on the top-level key management aspect and we do not address derivation of child keys. Our solution speeds up handover signaling by one round trip time (RTT) to the home domain. We investigate also the relevance of key hierarchy solutions proposed in IETF for speeding up re-authentications.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOMW.2007.4437814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4437775","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","pdfPath":"/iel5/4437774/4437775/04437814.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Globecom Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Globecom Workshops","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOMW.2007.4437814","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UMTS-AKA and EAP-AKA Inter-working for Fast Handovers in All-IP Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Authentication","Wireless networks","3G mobile communication","Delay","Mobile communication","Access protocols","Long Term Evolution","Wireless application protocol","Identity management systems","Europe"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","IP networks","mobility management (mobile radio)","telecommunication services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UMTS-AKA","EAP-AKA","interworking","all-IP networks","3GPP service architecture evolution","long term evolution","key management","mutual authentication","universal subscriber identity module","Authentication and Key Agreement","Round Trip Time","handover signaling","IETF"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["key management","seamless handovers","security","wireless networks","IP"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"UMTS-AKA and EAP-AKA Inter-working for Fast Handovers in All-IP Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4437814/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4437814/","accessionNumber":"10076222","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UMTS-AKA and EAP-AKA Inter-working for Fast Handovers in All-IP Networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"GLOCOMW-00-39.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071267S","chronDate":"26-30 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4437774","isNumber":"4437775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4437774","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4437775","articleId":"4437814","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4437829,"authors":[{"name":"William E.

Waveguides with small bends may be formed allowing compact integrated photonic circuits to be formed. Full three-dimensional (3D) photonic simulations are required in order to realize very low loss, integrated photonic crystal circuits. Needless to say, the design and fabrication of such fully 3D structures is challenging, and thus efficient simulation tools are necessary to identify the optimum structures for different applications. Researchers at the Department of Defense (DoD) and Arizona State University (ASU) have independently developed parallel Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) codes, with the goal of scaling up each simulator for complicated structures such as 3D optical integrated circuits (OIC). As the name implies, FDTD is a popular time-domain method for solving Maxwell's equations for the electric and magnetic fields. These two curl equations are solved explicitly in time over half-step intervals, where the values of one set of field values (e.g., electric fields) are used at the successive interval to solve for the other field (e.g., magnetic field) in a time marching fashion. The goal of our current work is to realize a fully parallel FDTD code scalable to 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">8</sup>\n FDTD grid points in order to have sufficient resolution to model even a relatively limited number of periods of a given waveguide structure. This requires both a scalable parallel FDTD code, as well as one with the proper boundary conditions and more efficient algorithms to reduce run. The work and results discussed herein address both the scalability and the efficiency of the time-domain algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/HPCMP-UGC.2007.59","publicationTitle":"2007 DoD High Performance Computing Modernization Program Users Group Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 DoD High Performance Computing Modernization Program Users Group Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4437948/4437949/04437986.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCMP-UGC.2007.59","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4437949","startPage":"205","endPage":"210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel 3D FDTD Simulator for Photonic Crystals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4437986","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Parallel 3D FDTD Simulator for Photonic Crystals","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4437986/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9912522","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4437986/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel 3D FDTD Simulator for Photonic Crystals","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"30880205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077022S","chronDate":"18-21 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4437948","isNumber":"4437949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4437948","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4437949","articleId":"4437986","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4437998,"authors":[{"name":"D.

FDTD simulations can be very computationally expensive and require thousands of CPU hours to solve on traditional general purpose processors. Modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) found in desktop computers are programmable and are capable of much higher vector floating-point performance than general purpose CPUs. This paper shows how GPUs can be used to greatly speedup FDTD simulations. The main objective is to leverage GPU processing power for FDTD update calculations and complete computationally expensive simulations in reasonable time. This allows researchers to simulate much longer pulse lengths and larger models than was possible in the past. A new FDTD code was developed to leverage graphics processors using Linux, C, OpenGL, Cg, and commodity GeForce 7 series GPUs. The graphics hardware was accessed through standard OpenGL. The FDTD model space was then transferred to the GPU device memory through OpenGL textures and host readable via frame buffer objects exposed by the OpenGL 2.0 application programming interface (API). GPU fragment processors were utilized for the FDTD update computations via Cg fragment programs. For models that were sufficiently large, greater than (140)\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n cells, the GPU performed FDTD update calculations at least 12 times faster than the execution of the same simulation on a contemporary multicore CPU from Intel or AMD. The use of GPUs shows great promise for high performance computing applications like FDTD that have high arithmetic intensity and limited or no data dependencies in computation streams. Until recently, to use GPUs as a co-processor, the normalCPU-based code needed to be rewritten extensively using special graphics programming language Cg and OpenGL APIs, which is difficult for non-graphics programmers. However, newer GPUs, such as NVIDIA's G80, provide unified shaders models for programming GPU processing elements and APIs that allow compiler tools to allow direct programming of graphics hardware without extra intermediate graphics programming with OpenGL and Cg. Currently, a message passing interface-based parallel GPU FDTD code is being developed and benchmarked on a cluster of G80 GPUs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) Simulations Using Graphics Processors","publicationTitle":"2007 DoD High Performance Computing Modernization Program Users Group Conference","doi":"10.1109/HPCMP-UGC.2007.34","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 DoD High Performance Computing Modernization Program Users Group Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4437948/4437949/04438007.pdf","startPage":"334","endPage":"338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCMP-UGC.2007.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4437949","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4438007","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4438007/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) Simulations Using Graphics Processors","conferenceDate":"18-21 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4438007/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9912534","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) Simulations Using Graphics Processors","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"30880334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087071S","chronDate":"18-21 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4437948","isNumber":"4437949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4437948","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4437949","articleId":"4438007","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4438011,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Because the rays are independent of one another, ray tracing can benefit greatly from parallel processing, especially when there are billions of rays to be traced. The efficiency of using 839 AMD Opteron processors for this application has been shown to be 97.9 %. This means that adding additional processors is a highly effective strategy for increasing the rate of ray tracing, thus reducing the time of simulation. Using field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) is an effective strategy for further increasing the rate of ray tracing. In this paper we describe key aspects of implementing deeply pipelined processors within an FPGA to perform scientific computations, using them to supplement the ray tracing provided by the sequential Opteron processors in the Cray XD-1. The discussion includes how to schedule the use of the FPGA's internal resources, synchronize the interaction between the FPGA and the Opterons, and assess the fraction of time that each major computational resource within the FPGA is in use. We discuss a method that guarantees 100 % efficiency of the critical resource, the resource needed most often for a specific computation. We also consider how to increase the efficiency of the non-critical computational resources within the FPGA and what the side effects of such changes can be.","doi":"10.1109/HPCMP-UGC.2007.79","publicationTitle":"2007 DoD High Performance Computing Modernization Program Users Group Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 DoD High Performance Computing Modernization Program Users Group Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4437948/4437949/04438011.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCMP-UGC.2007.79","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4437949","startPage":"359","endPage":"363","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using FPGAs to Supplement Ray-Tracing Computations on the Cray XD-1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4438011","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Using FPGAs to Supplement Ray-Tracing Computations on the Cray XD-1","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4438011/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9904894","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4438011/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using FPGAs to Supplement Ray-Tracing Computations on the Cray XD-1","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"30880359.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039817S","chronDate":"18-21 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4437948","isNumber":"4437949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4437948","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4437949","articleId":"4438011","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4438028,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Disk Tree is built from a collection of storage nodes, small storage appliances containing commodity disks, CPU, RAM and interconnection interfaces. Each node provides moderate levels of reliability, availability, and performance. We examine four possible configurations: striping, mirroring, logging and caching Disk Tree. We have implemented a three-tier and seven-node Disk Tree prototype and carried out extensive performance evaluations using popular benchmark for these four configurations. Depending on different I/O workloads, these four configurations perform quite differently. In general, mirroring and striping disk tree performs well on read-intensive applications while logging and caching disk tree performs well on write-intensive applications.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SNAPI.2007.9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4438033","publicationTitle":"Fourth International Workshop on Storage Network Architecture and Parallel I/Os (SNAPI 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"Fourth International Workshop on Storage Network Architecture and Parallel I/Os (SNAPI 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4438032/4438033/04438047.pdf","endPage":"54","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Disk Tree: A Fat-Tree Based Heterogeneous Multi-tier Storage Architecture","doi":"10.1109/SNAPI.2007.9","startPage":"47","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4438047","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-24 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Disk Tree: A Fat-Tree Based Heterogeneous Multi-tier Storage Architecture","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4438047/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9912624","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4438047/","conferenceDate":"24-24 Sept. 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Disk Tree: A Fat-Tree Based Heterogeneous Multi-tier Storage Architecture","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"30970047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063533S","chronDate":"24-24 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4438032","isNumber":"4438033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4438032","xplore-issue":"4438033","articleId":"4438047","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4438098,"authors":[{"name":"Raluca Lefticaru","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Mathematics, University of Pitesti, Pitesti, Romania"],"firstName":"Raluca","lastName":"Lefticaru","id":"37681121900"},{"name":"Florentin Ipate","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Mathematics, University of Pitesti, Pitesti, Romania"],"firstName":"Florentin","lastName":"Ipate","id":"37297277100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-8739-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4438098","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":408},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic testing","Genetic algorithms","Software testing","Automata","Unified modeling language","Fault detection","System testing","Books","Scientific computing","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","program testing","software engineering","Unified Modeling Language"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic state-based test generation","genetic algorithms","functional specification","test data generation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4438098","abstract":"Although a lot of research has been done in the field of state-based testing, the automatic generation of test cases from a functional specification in the form of a state machine is not straightforward.

Upon closer examination, however, MDA mainly shifts the focus of iterative development to a higher level of abstraction. The traditional waterfall software development process (and its variations) dictates that the system development be driven by low-level design and coding. This can introduce many productivity, maintenance and documentation issues into the process. Using the MDA pushes development to a higher level, where platform-independent analysis and detailed platform-specific design modeling make it easier to trace back to the requirements, thereby introducing a more stringent governance over the project. Also, it introduces a technology and platform independent standardized development process, system interoperability internally as well as the ability to provide communication bridges with external systems. The systems can be portable, which allows for what the creators of the MDA, the object management group (OMG), refer to as \"future proofing\" of software systems. This is the ability to have long-lived models that can be applied to any new implementation technologies that will ultimately be created and introduced to the software development world. This paper seeks to introduce and demystify MDA concepts and features, and show how their application can be used to develop highly interoperable and robust medical device software systems. In particular, if medical devices are designed using the MDA approach, they can quickly be adapted to utilize any interoperability (or \"plug and play\") standard that evolves in the future.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4438180/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4438180/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9904856","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Designing and Developing Medical Device Software Systems Using the Model Driven Architecture (MDA)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing and Developing Medical Device Software Systems Using the Model Driven Architecture (MDA)","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"30810156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065207S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4438151","isNumber":"4438152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4438151","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4438152","articleId":"4438180","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4438251,"authors":[{"name":"Kanchan Devarakonda","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Kanchan","lastName":"Devarakonda","id":"38275055000"},{"name":"Sotirios G.

A multitude of options are available to perform this task. This report details our hardware implementation of three such schemes on FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays). The first scheme calculates the packet loss and one-way network delay using RTF over UDP; the second one uses the concept of TOPPs (Train of Packet Pairs) to measure the available bandwidth, and the third one is a partial implementation of TCP, which can be developed further to measure various parameters. Our analysis shows that these implementations can carry out efficient parameter measurements at reasonable hardware cost. In addition, experiments are used to compare three hashing schemes for storing TCP tuple information; real benchmarks are used.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4438251/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9825755","htmlLink":"/document/4438251/","conferenceDate":"19-25 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Measuring Network Parameters with Hardware Support","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measuring Network Parameters with Hardware Support","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"25580002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060044S","chronDate":"19-25 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4438242","isNumber":"4438243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4438242","xplore-issue":"4438243","articleId":"4438251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4438299,"authors":[{"name":"V.

These devices contain large cache memories, whose power consumption can reach about 50% of the total spent energy, from which leakage energy is the predominant fraction in current technologies. This paper proposes a technique to reduce leakage energy consumption in data caches on embedded systems, which is based on the fact that most stored bits take a logical value of zero. The proposed technique has been evaluated on a model of a contemporary high-end embedded microprocessor, namely the ARM Cortex A8 processor, executing a set of standard embedded benchmarks.

This paradigm has evolved into task based computing where the application composition relies on explicit user task descriptions. The composition of applications has to be performed at run-time as the environment is dynamic and heterogeneous due to e.g., mobility of the user. An algorithm that decides on a component set and allocates it onto hosts accordingly to user task preferences and the platform constraints plays a central role in the application composition process. In this paper we will describe an algorithm for task-based application allocation. The algorithm uses micro-genetic approach and is characterized by a very low computational load and good convergence properties. We will compare the performance and the scalability of our algorithm with a straightforward evolutionary algorithm.

Even though acoustic signals are often corrupted in the high noise level environment, speech recognition systems such as the widely-used HTK do not deal with signal distortion problems. We propose an architecture that effectively combines adaptive beamforming (ABF) and blind source separation (BSS) algorithms in the spatial domain. To avoid permutation ambiguity and heavy computational complexity in the BSS system, the adaptive generalized sidelobe canceller is employed in front of the BSS system. We slightly modified the conventional convolutive mixture model of the BSS for fast processing in hardware implementations. Unlike the conventional BSS, this does not suffer from permutation ambiguity since the target angle of the front-line beamformer is fixed so it always provides enhanced and reference noise signals to the predefined two inputs of the BSS. The proposed system also reduces heavy computations in the BSS when the BSS have more than two inputs. The proposed time domain approach can be easily implemented into hardware in real-time. We evaluated the structure and assessed its performance with a DSP module. The experimental results of speech recognition test show that the proposed combined system guarantees high speech recognition rate in the noisy environment and better performance than the ABF and BSS system.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2007 International Conference on Intelligent Pervasive Computing (IPC 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4438370/4438371/04438427.pdf","startPage":"214","endPage":"219","publicationTitle":"The 2007 International Conference on Intelligent Pervasive Computing (IPC 2007)","doi":"10.1109/IPC.2007.72","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPC.2007.72","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4438371","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4438427","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined Architecture of Adaptive Beamforming and Blind Source Separation for Speech Recognition of Intelligent Service Robots","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Blind source separation","Speech recognition","Intelligent robots","Service robots","Source separation","Working environment noise","Hardware","Acoustic noise","Noise level"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","blind source separation","intelligent robots","service robots","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive beamforming algorithm","blind source separation algorithm","speech recognition system","intelligent service robots","permutation ambiguity","computational complexity","adaptive generalized sidelobe canceller","BSS system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4438427/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Combined Architecture of Adaptive Beamforming and Blind Source Separation for Speech Recognition of Intelligent Service Robots","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4438427/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9881259","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined Architecture of Adaptive Beamforming and Blind Source Separation for Speech Recognition of Intelligent Service Robots","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"30060214.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054712S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4438370","isNumber":"4438371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4438370","xplore-issue":"4438371","articleId":"4438427","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4438455,"authors":[{"name":"Ze-Guang Jin","affiliation":["Division of Computer Eng., Mokwon University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ze-Guang","lastName":"Jin","id":"37655171300"},{"name":"Heau-Jo Kang","affiliation":["Division of Computer Eng., Mokwon University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Heau-Jo","lastName":"Kang","id":"37655006500"},{"name":"Yoon-Ho Kim","affiliation":["Division of Computer Eng., Mokwon University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yoon-Ho","lastName":"Kim","id":"37657141200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3006-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4438455","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":31},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error probability","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Fading","Information filtering","Information filters","Intserv networks","Mobile ad hoc networks","Routing protocols","Broadcasting","Proposals"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new scheme for efficient integrated service and route discovery in mobile ad hoc networks. We propose a Bloom filter based (BF) scheme. We extend the Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP) in order to encapsulate service information in its routing messages. Thus, a node requesting a service in addition to discovering that service, it is simultaneously informed of the route to the service provider. The service information piggybacked to the routing message is represented as a bit vector called Bloom Filter which represents a decentralized space-efficient discovery method. Instead of broadcasting full information about the type and location of service information, nodes send Bloom filters in the NDP messages of the ZRP protocol which contain service type information for all the reachable nodes up to a certain number of hops away. Our proposal not only saves both the restrictive resources of the wireless devices such as computational power and energy but also improves the overall protocol performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Improvement of Block Error Probabilities of FS MC-CDMA System Using BCH Coding Scheme in Slow Multi-path Fading Channels","publicationTitle":"The 2007 International Conference on Intelligent Pervasive Computing (IPC 2007)","doi":"10.1109/IPC.2007.70","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2007 International Conference on Intelligent Pervasive Computing (IPC 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4438370/4438371/04438455.pdf","startPage":"360","endPage":"363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPC.2007.70","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4438371","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4438455","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4438455/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Performance Improvement of Block Error Probabilities of FS MC-CDMA System Using BCH Coding Scheme in Slow Multi-path Fading Channels","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4438455/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9881254","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Improvement of Block Error Probabilities of FS MC-CDMA System Using BCH Coding Scheme in Slow Multi-path Fading Channels","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"30060360.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052134S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4438370","isNumber":"4438371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4438370","xplore-issue":"4438371","articleId":"4438455","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4438536,"authors":[{"name":"Keqiu Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Keqiu","lastName":"Li","id":"37277619000"},{"name":"Takashi Nanya","affiliation":["Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, University of Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Nanya","id":"37273869800"},{"name":"Wenyu Qu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Dalian Maritime University, China"],"firstName":"Wenyu","lastName":"Qu","id":"37266701400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3007-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3007-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4438536","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Mobile computing","Energy consumption","Streaming media","Network interfaces","Operating systems","Personal digital assistants","Grid computing","Computer science","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","mobile computing","operating systems (computers)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficient methods","mobile computing","network interface","network protocols","operating systems","application design"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a survey of energy efficient methods and techniques for in the environment of mobile computing.

In addition, sample rendering times for a typical power system display, along with comments on the relative advantages and disadvantages of using the CPU and GPU to perform contouring, are provided.","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.2008.102","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 41st Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 41st Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4438695/4438696/04438871.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"168","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.2008.102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4438696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contouring for Power Systems Using Graphical Processing Units","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4438871","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Jan. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4438871/","displayDocTitle":"Contouring for Power Systems Using Graphical Processing Units","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9904561","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4438871/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Jan. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contouring for Power Systems Using Graphical Processing Units","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"30750168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084096S","chronDate":"7-10 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4438695","isNumber":"4438696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4438695","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4438696","articleId":"4438871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-29"},{"_id":4438874,"authors":[{"name":"Gerard Stenbakken","affiliation":["National Institute for Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Gerard","lastName":"Stenbakken","id":"37299004100"},{"name":"Tom Nelson","affiliation":["National Institute for Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Nelson","id":"37291249200"},{"name":"Ming Zhou","affiliation":["Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38182763200"},{"name":"Virgilio Centeno","affiliation":["Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Virgilio","lastName":"Centeno","id":"37281640400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3075-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1605"}],"articleNumber":"4438874","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":217},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Phasor measurement units","Power measurement","Electric variables measurement","Phase measurement","Measurement units","Measurement standards","Monitoring","Frequency","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","phase measurement","power system measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic calibration","electric power phaser measurement units","IEEE synchrophasor standard C37.118-2005","dynamic power signal monitoring","sampled dynamic signals aliasing","interharmonic signal"]}],"abstract":"This paper discusses measurements of the dynamic performance of electric power phaser measurement units, PMUs, and their relation to the requirements of the IEEE synchrophasor standard C37.118-2005. In particular, it proposes a new method for monitoring the dynamic power signals that change in amplitude and frequency during the testing of PMUs. The new method estimates the reference values for dynamic power signals so they can be compared with the PMU values to determine the PMU's errors. This requires estimating the \"true\" timestamped values of dynamic power signals with low uncertainty. The paper also discusses the issue of aliasing of sampled dynamic signals, and the relationship between the requirement in the standard to reject an out of band or interharmonic signal and dynamic signal performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reference Values for Dynamic Calibration of PMUs","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 41st Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS 2008)","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.2008.370","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 41st Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4438695/4438696/04438874.pdf","startPage":"171","endPage":"171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.2008.370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4438696","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4438874","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4438874/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Jan. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Reference Values for Dynamic Calibration of PMUs","conferenceDate":"7-10 Jan. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4438874/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9912430","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reference Values for Dynamic Calibration of PMUs","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"30750171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060364S","chronDate":"7-10 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4438695","isNumber":"4438696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4438695","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4438696","articleId":"4438874","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4438878,"authors":[{"name":"Michael LeMay","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"LeMay","id":"37663247500"},{"name":"Rajesh Nelli","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Rajesh","lastName":"Nelli","id":"37828590800"},{"name":"George Gross","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Gross","id":"37268076300"},{"name":"Carl A.

The implementation of such programs may reduce energy costs and increase reliability. To fully harness such benefits, existing load controllers and appliances need around-the-clock price information. Advances in the development and deployment of advanced meter infrastructures (AMIs), building automation systems (BASs), and various dedicated embedded control systems provide the capability to effectively address this requirement. In this paper we introduce a meter gateway architecture (MGA) to serve as a foundation for integrated control of loads by energy aggregators, facility hubs, and intelligent appliances. We discuss the requirements that motivate the architecture, describe its design, and illustrate its application to a small system with an intelligent appliance and a legacy appliance using a prototype implementation of an intelligent hub for the MGA and ZigBee wireless communications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load management","Communication system control","Home appliances","Automatic control","Costs","Ambient intelligence","Buildings","Automation","Control systems","Centralized control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["building management systems","load regulation","power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demand response communications","electricity structure","load controllers","building automation systems","meter gateway architecture","energy aggregators"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4438696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.2008.60","startPage":"174","endPage":"174","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 41st Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 41st Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4438695/4438696/04438878.pdf","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.2008.60","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Integrated Architecture for Demand Response Communications and Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Integrated Architecture for Demand Response Communications and Control","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9904566","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Jan. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4438878/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4438878/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Jan. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Integrated Architecture for Demand Response Communications and Control","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"30750174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045074S","chronDate":"7-10 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4438695","isNumber":"4438696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4438695","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"4438696","articleId":"4438878","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4438889,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Hines","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Seth Blumsack (M '06) is an Assistant Professor in the Dept. of Energy and Mineral Engineering at Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA.

In order to facilitate tasks such as the creation and sharing of knowledge in teams, we propose a collaborative dimensions framework as a tool for understanding how visual artefacts can facilitate collaboration in circumstances that involve distributed knowledge. The framework is based on the widespread Cognitive Dimensions of Notation framework and is enriched with criteria from the boundary object paradigm discussed in organization science.

In the proposed match-line architecture, the match line in each TCAM word is partitioned into four segments and is selectively pre-charged to reduce the match-line power consumption. The partially charged match lines are evaluated to determine the final comparison result by sharing the charges deposited in various parts of the partitioned segments. This arrangement reduces the match-line power consumption by reducing effective capacitor loading and voltage swing at match lines. The segmented architecture also enhances operational speed by evaluating multiple segments in parallel and by overlapping the pre-charging and evaluation stages. 512 times 72 TCAM is designed using 0.18-mum CMOS technology. The extracted \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RC</i>\n values are used to show the power reduction benefits. The sample design demonstrated that the match-line power consumption using a segmented match line was conservatively 44% of that produced by traditional parallel TCAM. The power savings by segmenting match lines can be up to 41% over a low-voltage swing technique due to the independent discharge capability in segmented match-line architecture.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.916624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4563499","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.916624","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4563499/04439202.pdf","startPage":"1485","endPage":"1494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Power Ternary Content-Addressable Memory Design Using a Segmented Match Line","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2008","displayDocTitle":"Low-Power Ternary Content-Addressable Memory Design Using a Segmented Match Line","volume":"55","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4439202/","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10117078","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4439202/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Power Ternary Content-Addressable Memory Design Using a Segmented Match Line","sourcePdf":"55tcsi06-baeg.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146083S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4563499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"4563499","articleId":"4439202","onlineDate":"02 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4439204,"authors":[{"name":"Rosa A.

In particular, in this paper, their application for single-phase photovoltaic systems is considered. The effects of nonlinear inductance on the performance of current controllers designed to track periodic signals and/or to compensate periodic disturbances are investigated. When the inductance has a nonlinear behavior, a distorted current waveform is produced. Two different nonlinearities have been considered: saturation for high currents and a light nonlinearity, which occurs in the first portion of the magnetization curve, for low currents. A current-dependent model of the nonlinear inductance has been developed. It is mathematically based on the Volterra-series expansion, and it allows us to prove how the harmonic compensation provided by resonant and repetitive controllers can also mitigate the effects of the inductance saturation. This result is the main contribution of this paper, and it is also substantiated with experimental evidence. Moreover, the repetitive controller is able to comply with the harmonic limits reported in IEEE 1547 and IEC 61727, even in very hard saturation conditions.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.917117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4505400","startPage":"2043","endPage":"2052","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4505400/04439204.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of the Effects of Inductor Nonlinear Behavior on the Performance of Current Controllers for Single-Phase PV Grid Converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4439204/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4439204/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Study of the Effects of Inductor Nonlinear Behavior on the Performance of Current Controllers for Single-Phase PV Grid Converters","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9960760","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of the Effects of Inductor Nonlinear Behavior on the Performance of Current Controllers for Single-Phase PV Grid Converters","sourcePdf":"55tie05-mastromauro.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074641S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4505400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"4505400","articleId":"4439204","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4439205,"authors":[{"name":"Yasser Abdel-Rady Ibrahim Mohamed","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4505400/4439205/4439205-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yasser Abdel-Rady Ibrahim Mohamed was born in Cairo, Egypt, on November 25, 1977.

To ensure perfect regulation of the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC) and provide means for rejecting fast and dynamic voltage disturbances, the frequency modes of the disturbances to be eliminated should be included in the stable closed-loop system. Toward this, a hybrid voltage controller combining a linear with variable-structure control element is proposed for an inverter-based distributed-generation interface to regulate the voltage at the PCC. The proposed voltage controller can embed a wide band of frequency modes through an equivalent internal model. Subsequently, a wide range of voltage perturbations, including capacitor-switching disturbances, can be rejected. To account for unbalanced voltage disturbances, a dual-sequence voltage controller is proposed. To provide accurate and robust tracking of the generated active and reactive current trajectories, a newly designed deadbeat current control algorithm is proposed. The controller is designed under the practical considerations of inherent plant delays, which are associated with the digital implementation of the control algorithm, and the uncertain nature of the current dynamics. Theoretical analysis and comparative evaluation tests are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4505400","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4505400/04439205.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.917057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.917057","startPage":"2072","endPage":"2084","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Control Scheme for PWM Voltage-Source Distributed-Generation Inverters for Fast Load-Voltage Regulation and Effective Mitigation of Unbalanced Voltage Disturbances","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4439205/","displayDocTitle":"A Control Scheme for PWM Voltage-Source Distributed-Generation Inverters for Fast Load-Voltage Regulation and Effective Mitigation of Unbalanced Voltage Disturbances","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4439205/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"9944371","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Control Scheme for PWM Voltage-Source Distributed-Generation Inverters for Fast Load-Voltage Regulation and Effective Mitigation of Unbalanced Voltage Disturbances","sourcePdf":"55tie05-mohamed.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095738S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4505400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"4505400","articleId":"4439205","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4439206,"authors":[{"name":"Hiren Patel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sarvajanik College of Engineering and Technology, Surat, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4481189/4439206/4439206-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hiren Patel received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from South Gujarat University, Surat, India, in 1996, and the M.Tech. degree in energy systems in 2003 from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IITB), Mumbai, India, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","He is an Assistant Professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Sarvajanik College of Engineering and Technology, Surat.

This makes the tracking of the actual maximum power point (MPP) [global peak (GP)] a difficult task. In addition, most of the existing schemes are unable to extract maximum power from the PV array under these conditions. This paper proposes a novel algorithm to track the global power peak under partially shaded conditions. The formulation of the algorithm is based on several critical observations made out of an extensive study of the PV characteristics and the behavior of the global and local peaks under partially shaded conditions. The proposed algorithm works in conjunction with a DC-DC converter to track the GP. In order to accelerate the tracking speed, a feedforward control scheme for operating the DC-DC converter is also proposed, which uses the reference voltage information from the tracking algorithm to shift the operation toward the MPP. The tracking time with this controller is about one-tenth as compared to a conventional controller. All the observations and conclusions, including simulation and experimental results, are presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4481189/04439206.pdf","startPage":"1689","endPage":"1698","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.917118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.917118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4481189","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4439206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum Power Point Tracking Scheme for PV Systems Operating Under Partially Shaded Conditions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solar power generation","Costs","Photovoltaic systems","Solar energy","Energy conversion","Testing","Acceleration","Voltage control","Pollution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","feedforward","photovoltaic power systems","solar cell arrays","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum power point tracking","PV systems","photovoltaic arrays","partially shaded condition","current-voltage characteristics","power-voltage characteristics","DC-DC converter","feedforward control scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Global peak (GP)","maximum power point tracking (MPPT)","partial shading","power\u2013voltage ($P$\u2013  $V$) characteristics"]},{"kwd":["P-V Characteristics","Partial Shading","Maximum Power Point Tracking","Global Peak"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4439206/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Maximum Power Point Tracking Scheme for PV Systems Operating Under Partially Shaded Conditions","volume":"55","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4439206/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920937","dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum Power Point Tracking Scheme for PV Systems Operating Under Partially Shaded Conditions","sourcePdf":"55tie04-patel.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054891S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4481189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"691","xplore-issue":"4481189","articleId":"4439206","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4439209,"authors":[{"name":"Sergio Vazquez","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering Escuela Superior de Ingenieros, University of Seville, Seville, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4481189/4439209/4439209-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sergio Vazquez (S'04) was born in Seville, Spain, in 1974.

A controller design process, a stability study of the system, and experimental results for a synchronous three-phase power rectifier prototype are presented to validate the proposed controller.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Model-Based Direct Power Control for Three-Phase Power Converters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.917113","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4481189/04439209.pdf","startPage":"1647","endPage":"1657","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.917113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4481189","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4439209","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4439209/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Model-Based Direct Power Control for Three-Phase Power Converters","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4439209/","dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920945","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Model-Based Direct Power Control for Three-Phase Power Converters","sourcePdf":"55tie04-vazquez.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093889S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4481189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"4481189","articleId":"4439209","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4439211,"authors":[{"name":"Choongchae Woo","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Choongchae","lastName":"Woo","id":"37338793600"},{"name":"Eunsung Oh","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Eunsung","lastName":"Oh","id":"37580176700"},{"name":"Daesik Hong","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Daesik","lastName":"Hong","id":"37274629700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4439211","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"The focus of this paper is a proposal for a computationally efficient dynamic subcarrier allocation (DSA) algorithm for orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) systems.

The flexibility of the on-chip clock generation capability found in modern FPGAs is employed to step through a range of frequencies until timing failure in the combinatorial circuit is detected. In this way, the delay of any combinatorial circuit can be determined with a timing resolution of 1 ps or lower. A parallel implementation of the method for self-characterization of the delay of all the LUTs on an FPGA is also proposed. The method was applied to an Altera Cyclone-II FPGA (EP2C35). A complete self-characterization was achieved in 3 seconds, utilizing only 13 kbit of block RAM to store the results. This self-characterization method paves the way for matching timing requirements in designs to FPGAs as a means of combating the problem of process variations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-characterization of Combinatorial Circuit Delays in FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2007.4439227","startPage":"17","endPage":"23","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPT.2007.4439227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4439214","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4439213/4439214/04439227.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4439227","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4439227/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Self-characterization of Combinatorial Circuit Delays in FPGAs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4439227/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9832857","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-characterization of Combinatorial Circuit Delays in FPGAs","confLoc":"Kitakyusyu, Japan","sourcePdf":"FPT07-00-13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080066S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4439213","isNumber":"4439214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4439213","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4439214","articleId":"4439227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4439228,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Although primarily employed in network intrusion detection systems, feature extraction is also used to determine various other aspects of a network's behavior such as total traffic and average connection size.

In this paper, we propose an FPGA-based reconfigurable architecture for feature extraction of large high-speed networks. Our design makes use of parallel rows of hash functions and sketch tables in order to process network packets at a very high throughput. We present a detailed description of our architecture and its implementation on a Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGA board, and provide cycle-accurate timing results for feature extraction of input networking benchmark data.

This paper presents Contessa, a pure-functional continuation-based language for describing path-based Monte-Carlo simulations, and a completely automated method for turning platform-independent Contessa programs into high-performance hardware implementations. Our approach exploits the large degree of thread-based parallelism available in Monte-Carlo simulations, allowing data-dependent control-flow and loop-carried dependencies to be expressed, while retaining high-performance. The Contessa toolchain is evaluated using five different simulation kernels, in comparison to both software and manually described hardware. When compared to an existing FPGA implementation, Contessa requires a quarter of the Handel-C source-code length, and doubles the clock rate to over 300MHz while requiring a similar number of resources, and also provides a 35 times speedup over a C++ implementation using an Opteron 2.2GHz.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4439237/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4439237/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9832848","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Domain Specific Language for Reconfigurable Path-based Monte Carlo Simulations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Domain Specific Language for Reconfigurable Path-based Monte Carlo Simulations","confLoc":"Kitakyusyu, Japan","sourcePdf":"FPT07-00-23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037953S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4439213","isNumber":"4439214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4439213","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4439214","articleId":"4439237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4439238,"authors":[{"name":"Alastair M.

These components provide speed and density advantages due to the specialised logic and fixed interconnect. In this paper, a methodology is presented to automatically propose and explore the benefits of different types of fused arithmetic units for configurable devices. The methods are based on common subgraph extraction techniques, meaning that it is possible to explore different subcircuits that occur frequently across a set of benchmarks. A quantitative analysis is performed of the various fused-arithmetic circuits identified by our tool, which are then automatically synthesised to an ASIC process, providing a study of the speed and area benefits of the components. We report improvements of up to 3.3times in speed and 19.7times in area for the average improvement of particular silicon cores identified by our approach when compared to implementation of the same sub-circuits implemented in a commercial mixed-granularity FPGA in a comparable 90nm technology. The average improvements across all embedded cores identified by our approach are 1.67times and 5.55times when designing the ASIC cores for fastest speed performance.","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2007.4439238","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4439213/4439214/04439238.pdf","startPage":"105","endPage":"112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPT.2007.4439238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4439214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fused-Arithmetic Unit Generation for Reconfigurable Devices using Common Subgraph Extraction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4439238","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4439238/","displayDocTitle":"Fused-Arithmetic Unit Generation for Reconfigurable Devices using Common Subgraph Extraction","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9832849","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4439238/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fused-Arithmetic Unit Generation for Reconfigurable Devices using Common Subgraph Extraction","confLoc":"Kitakyusyu, Japan","sourcePdf":"FPT07-00-24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05296S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4439213","isNumber":"4439214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4439213","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4439214","articleId":"4439238","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4439239,"authors":[{"name":"Jacob A.

The integration of MRAM in FPGA allows the logic circuit to rapidly configure the algorithm, the routing and logic functions, easily realize the dynamical reconfiguration and multi-context configuration. However, the conventional MRAM technology based on field induced magnetic switching (FIMS) writing approach consumes very high power and large circuit surface, and produces high disturbance between memory cells. These drawbacks prevent FIMS-MRAM's further development in memory and logic circuit. Thermally assisted switching (TAS) based MRAM is then evaluated to address these issues and some design techniques for FPGA logic circuits based on TAS-MRAM technology are presented. By using STMicroelectronics CMOS 90 nm technology, some chip characteristic results have been calculated to demonstrate the expected performance of TAS-MRAM based FPGA logic circuits.","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2007.4439244","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4439213/4439214/04439244.pdf","startPage":"153","endPage":"160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPT.2007.4439244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4439214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TAS-MRAM based Non-volatile FPGA logic circuit","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"TAS-MRAM based Non-volatile FPGA logic circuit","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9832833","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4439244/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4439244/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TAS-MRAM based Non-volatile FPGA logic circuit","confLoc":"Kitakyusyu, Japan","sourcePdf":"FPT07-00-30.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054909S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4439213","isNumber":"4439214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4439213","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4439214","articleId":"4439244","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4439245,"authors":[{"name":"Dirk Koch","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science 12, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Koch","id":"38268904500"},{"name":"Christian Beckhoff","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science 12, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Beckhoff","id":"37695019800"},{"name":"Jurgen Teich","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science 12, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Jurgen","lastName":"Teich","id":"37069706300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1471-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1472-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4439245","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":248},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bitstream Decompression for High Speed FPGA Configuration from Slow Memories","abstract":"In this paper, we present hardware decompression accelerators for bridging the gap between high speed FPGA configuration interfaces and slow configuration memories.

However, this opens up the threat of theft of Intellectual Property (IP) since the system configuration is stored in easy-to-access Flash memory. To prevent this, high-end FPGAs have already been extended with symmetric-key decryption engines used to load an encrypted version of the configuration that cannot simply be copied and used without knowledge of the secret key. However, such protection systems based on straightforward use of symmetric cryptography are not well-suited with respect to business and licensing processes, since they are lacking a convenient scheme for key transport and installation. We propose a new protection scheme for the IP of circuits in configuration bit files that provides a significant improvement to the current unsatisfying situation. It uses both public-key and symmetric cryptography, but does not burden FPGAs with the usual overhead of public-key cryptography: While it needs hard-wired symmetric cryptography, the public-key functionality is moved into a temporary configuration bit stream for a one-time setup procedure. This approach requires only very few modifications to current FPGA technology. Using five basic stages, the new protection scheme allows new accounting models for volume licensing of IP, with automated key installation on FPGAs taking place at the customer's site.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4439213/4439214/04439246.pdf","startPage":"169","endPage":"176","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2007.4439246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPT.2007.4439246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4439214","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4439246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Intellectual Property Protection for Reconfigurable Devices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intellectual property","Protection","Field programmable gate arrays","Cryptography","Security","Hardware","Licenses","Circuits","Public key","Very large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","flash memories","logic design","reconfigurable architectures","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intellectual property protection","reconfigurable devices","SRAM","field programmable gate arrays","FPGA","flash memory","symmetric-key decryption engines","public-key cryptography","hard-wired symmetric cryptography","secure configuration","embedded security"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IP protection","secure configuration","FPGA","embedded security"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4439246/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Intellectual Property Protection for Reconfigurable Devices","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4439246/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9832845","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Intellectual Property Protection for Reconfigurable Devices","confLoc":"Kitakyusyu, Japan","sourcePdf":"FPT07-00-32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090569S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4439213","isNumber":"4439214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4439213","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4439214","articleId":"4439246","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4439248,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Zhou","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communication Network Engineering, Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37401067600"},{"name":"Harald Michalik","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communication Network Engineering, Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Michalik","id":"37283837600"},{"name":"Laszlo Hinsenkamp","affiliation":["DSI GmBH, Digital Signal Processing and Information Technology, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Laszlo","lastName":"Hinsenkamp","id":"37828621400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1471-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1472-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4439248","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":37,"totalDownloads":803},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Delay","Table lookup","Cryptography","Engines","Throughput","CMOS technology","Algorithm design and analysis","NIST","Application specific integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","field programmable gate arrays","logic gates","standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["advanced encryption standard","Galois/counter mode","FPGA","modular multiplication","AND gates","XOR gates","look-up-tables","Karatsuba algorithm","AES engine","Xilinx Virtex-4 devices"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4439248","abstract":"This paper addresses efficient and high-throughput implementations of AES-GCM optimized for FPGAs.

For the AES engine, the composite field approach is adopted and then inner-round pipelining technology is applied.

We obtain a proof of optimality by restricting ourselves to 4-input look-up tables (LUTs) and generating all possible circuits up to a certain area or latency depending on the optimization mode. Since simple-minded generation would take a long time, we develop levels of abstraction (steps) and techniques to restrict and order the search space, and produce results in practical time. We use logic decomposition to break up large designs, using the resulting trees to guide our search and prune the search space. The price of this optimality is that we are limited to small blocks; however, such blocks can be used to build larger designs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4439257/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9832854","htmlLink":"/document/4439257/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improving Bounds for FPGA Logic Minimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Bounds for FPGA Logic Minimization","confLoc":"Kitakyusyu, Japan","sourcePdf":"FPT07-00-43.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060291S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4439213","isNumber":"4439214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4439213","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4439214","articleId":"4439257","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4439261,"authors":[{"name":"Yoshihiro Kimura","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Sciences, Hiroshima City University, Asaminami-ku, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshihiro","lastName":"Kimura","id":"37831233400"},{"name":"Shin'ichi Wakabayashi","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Sciences, Hiroshima City University, Asaminami-ku, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Shin'ichi","lastName":"Wakabayashi","id":"37373522600"},{"name":"Shinobu Nagayama","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Sciences, Hiroshima City University, Asaminami-ku, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinobu","lastName":"Nagayama","id":"37267058500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1471-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1472-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4439261","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Parallel algorithms","Pipelines","Large-scale systems","Optimization methods","Hardware","Mathematical programming","Genetic engineering","Design engineering","Traveling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinatorial mathematics","computational complexity","field programmable gate arrays","heuristic programming","parallel algorithms","pipeline processing","quadratic programming","random-access storage","search problems","systolic arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["systolic algorithm","quadratic assignment problem","FPGA implementation","parallel algorithm","tabu search","one-dimensional processing unit array","pipeline fashion","internal block RAM","NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a parallel algorithm to solve the quadratic assignment problem in a short execution time.

This problem in its general formulation requires an exhaustive search of the design space to identify the candidate instructions. A tradeoff between complexity and quality of the solution can be achieved limiting this search to implementable instructions. In this paper we propose a linear complexity algorithm for the generation of convex multiple input multiple output (MIMO) instructions of variable size based on the notion of spiral. Convex implementable MIMO clusters of instructions are identified by means of a spiral search through the levels of a graph. These new instructions can be directly selected or combined for more complex instruction-set extensions. An important feature of our algorithm is that it is neither restricted to basic-block level nor it imposes any limitation on the number of the newly instructions nor on the number of the inputs/outputs of these instructions.","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2007.4439280","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4439213/4439214/04439280.pdf","startPage":"337","endPage":"340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPT.2007.4439280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4439214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Spiral Search: A Linear Complexity Algorithm for the Generation of Convex MIMO Instruction-Set Extensions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4439280","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4439280/","displayDocTitle":"The Spiral Search: A Linear Complexity Algorithm for the Generation of Convex MIMO Instruction-Set Extensions","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9808643","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4439280/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Spiral Search: A Linear Complexity Algorithm for the Generation of Convex MIMO Instruction-Set Extensions","confLoc":"Kitakyusyu, Japan","sourcePdf":"FPT07-00-66.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078444S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4439213","isNumber":"4439214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4439213","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4439214","articleId":"4439280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4439286,"authors":[{"name":"Akira Yamawaki","affiliation":["Department of Erectronic Engineering, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Yamawaki","id":"37429505100"},{"name":"Masahiko Iwane","affiliation":["Department of Erectronic Engineering, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiko","lastName":"Iwane","id":"37418433900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1471-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1472-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4439286","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Delay","Streaming media","Random access memory","High level synthesis","Image processing","Application specific integrated circuits","Software libraries","Design engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["C language","field programmable gate arrays","image processing","integrated circuit design","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["programmable load-store unit","C-based hardware design","FPGA","flexible memory access methods","memory access latency","hardware modules","high-level synthesis tool","image processing","memory access circuits","system-on-chips","SOC"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes to introduce a programmable load/store unit (LSU) to C-based hardware design for an FPGA.

Commercial FPGA companies also provide system design tools that abstract sufficient low-level system details to allow non-FPGA experts to design these systems for new applications. The application presented herein was designed by photomask researchers to implement a new technique for measuring the transparency of bimetallic grayscale masks using an FPGA platform. Production of the bimetallic grayscale masks requires a direct-write laser system. Previously, system calibration was determined by writing large rectangles of varying transparency on a mask and then measuring them using a spectrometer. The proposed technique uses the same mask-writing system but adds photodiode sensors connected to a multiprocessor computing system implemented on an FPGA. The added sensors combined with the laser beam's smaller focal point allows the calibration rectangles to be up to 5000 times smaller than those required by the spectrometer. This allows for direct mask verification on a mum-sized scale. Furthermore, the MPSoC design on the FPGA is easily scalable to support an increased number of photodiodes for the future addition of a feedback approach to the project.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multiprocessor System-on-Chip Implementation of a Laser-based Transparency Meter on an FPGA","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2007.4439289","startPage":"373","endPage":"376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPT.2007.4439289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4439214","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4439213/4439214/04439289.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4439289","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4439289/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Multiprocessor System-on-Chip Implementation of a Laser-based Transparency Meter on an FPGA","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4439289/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9832852","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multiprocessor System-on-Chip Implementation of a Laser-based Transparency Meter on an FPGA","confLoc":"Kitakyusyu, Japan","sourcePdf":"FPT07-00-75.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079103S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4439213","isNumber":"4439214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4439213","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4439214","articleId":"4439289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4439296,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Li","affiliation":["Research Institute of Automation, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Li","id":"37085665112"},{"name":"Lei Guo","affiliation":["School of Instrument Science and Opto-Electronics Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Guo","id":"37083736400"},{"name":"Changyin Sun","affiliation":["Research Institute of Automation, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Changyin","lastName":"Sun","id":"37279060100"},{"name":"Chong Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Complexity Science, College of Automation Engineering, Qingdao University of China, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Chong","lastName":"Lin","id":"37404176900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"4439296","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":91,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":496},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability criteria","Neural networks","Robust stability","Uncertainty","Linear matrix inequalities","Delay effects","Sun","Delay lines","Artificial neural networks","Automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods","neural nets","stability criteria","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","time-varying delays","augmented Lyapunov functional","delay-dependent asymptotic stability criterion","linear matrix inequalities"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asymptotic stability","delay-dependent","linear matrix inequality (LMI)","neural networks (NNs)","robust stability"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Computer Simulation","Linear Models","Models, Theoretical","Neural Networks (Computer)","Time Factors"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4439296","abstract":"In this brief paper, an augmented Lyapunov functional, which takes an integral term of state vector into account, is introduced.

We propose an aid system based on image processing to help the driver in these situations. The main purpose of an overtaking monitoring system is to segment the rear view and track the overtaking vehicle. We address this task with an optic-flow-driven scheme, focusing on the visual field in the side mirror by placing a camera on top of it. When driving a car, the ego-motion optic-flow pattern is very regular, i.e., all the static objects (such as trees, buildings on the roadside, or landmarks) move backwards. An overtaking vehicle, on the other hand, generates an optic-flow pattern in the opposite direction, i.e., moving forward toward the vehicle. This well-structured motion scenario facilitates the segmentation of regular motion patterns that correspond to the overtaking vehicle. Our approach is based on two main processing stages: First, the computation of optical flow in real time uses a customized digital signal processor (DSP) particularly designed for this task and, second, the tracking stage itself, based on motion pattern analysis, which we address using a standard processor. We present a validation benchmark scheme to evaluate the viability and robustness of the system using a set of overtaking vehicle sequences to determine a reliable vehicle-detection distance.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.917220","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4626110/04439300.pdf","startPage":"2736","endPage":"2746","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.917220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lane-Change Decision Aid System Based on Motion-Driven Vehicle Tracking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4439300","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4439300/","displayDocTitle":"Lane-Change Decision Aid System Based on Motion-Driven Vehicle Tracking","volume":"57","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10222406","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4439300/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lane-Change Decision Aid System Based on Motion-Driven Vehicle Tracking","sourcePdf":"57tvt05-diaz.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146399S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4626110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"4626110","articleId":"4439300","onlineDate":"02 February 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4439718,"authors":[{"name":"M.

An efficient optimization search algorithm referred to as the repeated weighted boosting search (RWBS) is employed at the upper level to identify the unknown MIMO channel while an enhanced ML sphere detector termed as the optimized hierarchy reduced search algorithm is used at the lower level to perform ML detection of the transmitted data. Only a minimum pilot overhead is required to aid the RWBS channel estimator's initial operation, which not only speeds up convergence but also avoids ambiguities inherent in blind joint estimation of both the channel and data.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-blind Joint Maximum Likelihood Channel Estimation and Data Detection for MIMO Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2007.911758","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/4418381/04439718.pdf","startPage":"202","endPage":"205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2007.911758","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418381","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4439718","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4439718/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"2008","displayDocTitle":"Semi-blind Joint Maximum Likelihood Channel Estimation and Data Detection for MIMO Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","htmlLink":"/document/4439718/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","publicationDate":"2008","accessionNumber":"9920156","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-blind Joint Maximum Likelihood Channel Estimation and Data Detection for MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"15lsp01-abuthinien.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089735S","chronDate":"2008","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"4418381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"4418381","articleId":"4439718","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4439723,"authors":[{"name":"Bogdan Dumitrescu","affiliation":["Tampere International Center for Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland","Politehnica University of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Bogdan","lastName":"Dumitrescu","id":"37270886200"},{"name":"lker Bayram","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Polytechnic University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"firstName":"lker","lastName":"Bayram","id":"38243080000"},{"name":"Ivan W.

The proposed method limits the motor currents during the starting period to lower than the demagnetization currents by doing commutation depending on the level of the measured phase currents. Experimental results show that the proposed method implemented in an inverter for a BLDC motor-driven reciprocating compressor considerably reduces not only the pulsating currents but also the vibration of the compressor during starting.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4439759/04439778.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"92","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2007.912734","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2007.912734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4439759","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4439778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Starting Method of the Surface Permanent-Magnet BLDC Motors Without Position Sensor for Reciprocating Compressor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Brushless DC motors","Demagnetization","Permanent magnet motors","Current measurement","Magnetic sensors","DC motors","Brushless motors","Scanning probe microscopy","Rotors","Permanent magnets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brushless DC motors","compressors","demagnetisation","permanent magnet motors","starting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BLDC motors","reciprocating compressor","position sensorless starting method","brushless dc motor","surface permanent-magnet rotor","irreversible demagnetization","inverter","compressor vibration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Brushless dc motor","reciprocating compressor","sensorless control","starting method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4439778/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-feb.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Starting Method of the Surface Permanent-Magnet BLDC Motors Without Position Sensor for Reciprocating Compressor","volume":"44","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4439778/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"10140611","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Starting Method of the Surface Permanent-Magnet BLDC Motors Without Position Sensor for Reciprocating Compressor","sourcePdf":"44tia01-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046117S","chronDate":"Jan.-feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"4439759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"4439759","articleId":"4439778","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4439782,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolaos Oikonomou","affiliation":["Electrical Machines and Drives Group, University of Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/4439759/4439782/4439782-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nikolaos Oikonomou (S'05) was born in Thessaloniki, Greece, in 1977.

The resulting current harmonics can be reduced by synchronous optimal pulsewidth modulation (PWM), provided that steady-state conditions prevail. Transient conditions, however, interfere adversely with the optimal modulation patterns. Such conditions necessarily occur when the modulator forms part of a conventional closed-loop control scheme. Trajectory tracking control is employed to achieve high dynamic control in conjunction with synchronous optimal PWM. An optimal trajectory of the stator flux linkage vector is derived from the pulse pattern in actual use. The stator flux linkage vector is forced to follow this target trajectory. Modifying the target trajectory in transient conditions enables closed-loop torque control in a deadbeat fashion while conserving optimal modulation. Experimental results obtained from a 30-kW prototype drive operated at only 200 Hz switching frequency demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2007.912735","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4439759/04439782.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4439759","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2007.912735","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","startPage":"115","endPage":"123","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closed-Loop Control of Medium-Voltage Drives Operated With Synchronous Optimal Pulsewidth Modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4439782","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-feb.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2008","displayDocTitle":"Closed-Loop Control of Medium-Voltage Drives Operated With Synchronous Optimal Pulsewidth Modulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4439782/","volume":"44","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4439782/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"10140612","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed-Loop Control of Medium-Voltage Drives Operated With Synchronous Optimal Pulsewidth Modulation","sourcePdf":"44tia01-oikonomou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044427S","chronDate":"Jan.-feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"4439759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"4439759","articleId":"4439782","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4439794,"authors":[{"name":"Tsai-Fu Wu","affiliation":["Elegant Power Application Research Center, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/4439759/4439794/4439794-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tsai-Fu Wu (S'88\u2013M'91\u2013SM'98) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from the National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1983, the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Ohio University, Athens, in 1988, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the University of Illinois, Chicago, in 1992.","From 1985 to 1986, he was a System Engineer in SAMPO, Inc., Taipei Hsien, Taiwan, where he was engaged in developing and designing graphic terminals.

It is also shown how the results can be further improved when random errors produced by the channel (as opposed to worst case errors) are considered.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.913261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.913261","startPage":"517","endPage":"530","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4439828/04439836.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4439828","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Error Correction of Regular LDPC Codes Using the Flipping Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4439836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2008","displayDocTitle":"On the Error Correction of Regular LDPC Codes Using the Flipping Algorithm","volume":"54","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9757241","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4439836/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Error Correction of Regular LDPC Codes Using the Flipping Algorithm","sourcePdf":"54tit02-burshtein.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108759S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4439828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4439828","articleId":"4439836","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4439837,"authors":[{"name":"Prasanna Chaporkar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Prasanna","lastName":"Chaporkar","id":"37295556900"},{"name":"Koushik Kar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Systems Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Koushik","lastName":"Kar","id":"37284697600"},{"name":"Xiang Luo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Systems Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Luo","id":"37306828100"},{"name":"Saswati Sarkar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Saswati","lastName":"Sarkar","id":"37275242000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4439837","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":187,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1046},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Wireless networks","Network topology","Systems engineering and theory","Interference constraints","Radio spectrum management","Processor scheduling","Centralized control","Mobile communication","Communication system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","radio networks","scheduling","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless network","throughput guarantees","distributed scheduling","interference degree","network topology","end-to-end multihop session"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fairness guarantees","maximal scheduling","throughput guarantees","wireless networks"]}],"abstract":"The question of providing throughput guarantees through distributed scheduling, which has remained an open problem for some time, is addressed in this paper. It is shown that a simple distributed scheduling strategy, maximal scheduling, attains a guaranteed fraction of the maximum throughput region in arbitrary wireless networks. The guaranteed fraction depends on the ldquointerference degreerdquo of the network, which is the maximum number of transmitter-receiver pairs that interfere with any given transmitter-receiver pair in the network and do not interfere with each other. Depending on the nature of communication, the transmission powers and the propagation models, the guaranteed fraction can be lower-bounded by the maximum link degrees in the underlying topology, or even by constants that are independent of the topology. The guarantees are tight in that they cannot be improved any further with maximal scheduling. The results can be generalized to end-to-end multihop sessions. Finally, enhancements to maximal scheduling that can guarantee fairness of rate allocation among different sessions, are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.913537","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4439828/04439837.pdf","startPage":"572","endPage":"594","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.913537","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4439828","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput and Fairness Guarantees Through Maximal Scheduling in Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4439837","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4439837/","displayDocTitle":"Throughput and Fairness Guarantees Through Maximal Scheduling in Wireless Networks","volume":"54","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9757242","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4439837/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput and Fairness Guarantees Through Maximal Scheduling in Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"54tit02-chaporkar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116955S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4439828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"187","xplore-issue":"4439828","articleId":"4439837","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4439846,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Rashidi Far","affiliation":["Canberra Industries, Inc., Meriden, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Rashidi Far","id":"37273437200"},{"name":"Tamer Oraby","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Tamer","lastName":"Oraby","id":"37828922500"},{"name":"Wlodek Bryc","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Wlodek","lastName":"Bryc","id":"37828923200"},{"name":"Roland Speicher","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Queen''s University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Roland","lastName":"Speicher","id":"37828923700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4439846","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":457},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"In a frequency-selective slow-fading channel in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, the channel matrix is of the form of a block matrix.

The main contribution of the paper consists in the proof that, assuming more than one receive antenna, any OSTBC with a transmission rate higher than a given threshold, which is inversely proportional to the number of transmit antennas, permits the blind identification of the MIMO channel from SOS. Additionally, it has been proven that any real OSTBC with an odd number of transmit antennas is identifiable, and that any OSTBC transmitting an odd number of real symbols permits the blind identification of the MIMO channel regardless of the number of receive antennas, which extends previous identifiability results and suggests that any nonidentifiable OSTBC can be made identifiable by slightly reducing its code rate. The implications of these theoretical results include the explanation of previous simulation examples and, from a practical point of view, they show that the only nonidentifiable OSTBCs with practical interest are the Alamouti codes and the real square orthogonal design with four transmit antennas.
