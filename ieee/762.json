It's important to improve the HPA linearity and not reduce the efficiency. The digital predistortion technique is suitable for improving linearity. In this paper, based on the maximum efficiency of the power amplifier, not the pursuit of perfect fitting characteristic curve of power amplifier and digital predistortion curve. For bandpass/passband communication signals, attention has been paid mainly to odd-order nonlinear terms. However, Even-Order nonlinear terms can also have a positive impact on the nonlinear on the nonlinear correction system. The simulation results show that the addition of power amplifier nonlinear even-order correction can improve the efficiency of the amplifier.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7625726","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URAI.2016.7625741","publicationTitle":"2016 13th International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots and Ambient Intelligence (URAI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 13th International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots and Ambient Intelligence (URAI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589475/7625726/07625741.pdf","startPage":"217","endPage":"224","doi":"10.1109/URAI.2016.7625741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Even-Order nonlinear correction of digital predistortion with maximum power amplification efficiency","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Even-Order nonlinear correction of digital predistortion with maximum power amplification efficiency","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7625741/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16413200","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7625741/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Even-Order nonlinear correction of digital predistortion with maximum power amplification efficiency","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"PS1-16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049675S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589475","isNumber":"7625726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589475","xplore-issue":"7625726","articleId":"7625741","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7625742,"authors":[{"name":"Jeongwon Pyo","affiliation":["The Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, SungKyunKwan University, Gyeonggi, Korea"],"firstName":"Jeongwon","lastName":"Pyo","id":"37085904153"},{"name":"Sanghoon Ji","affiliation":["Korea Institute of Industrial Technology, Gyeonggi, Korea"],"firstName":"Sanghoon","lastName":"Ji","id":"37591898500"},{"name":"Sujeong You","affiliation":["Korea Institute of Industrial Technology, Gyeonggi, Korea"],"firstName":"Sujeong","lastName":"You","id":"37085574694"},{"name":"Taeyoung Kuc","affiliation":["The Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, SungKyunKwan University, Gyeonggi, Korea"],"firstName":"Taeyoung","lastName":"Kuc","id":"37086057074"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0821-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0822-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7625742","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":441},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7625742","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thumb","Indexes","Computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","gesture recognition","image motion analysis","neural nets","palmprint recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["depth-based hand gesture recognition","convolutional neural networks","CNN","multiview changes","hand database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hand gesture","depth","CNN","classification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/URAI.2016.7625742","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589475/7625726/07625742.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 13th International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots and Ambient Intelligence (URAI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 13th International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots and Ambient Intelligence (URAI)","startPage":"225","endPage":"227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7625726","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URAI.2016.7625742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Depth-based hand gesture recognition using convolutional neural networks","abstract":"This paper presents the evaluations and analyses of hand gesture recognition using convolution neural networks (CNNs).
