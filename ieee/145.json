This paper examines the feasibility of relay satellite (RS) systems to meet these requirements. Anticipated requirements range from voice and low-speed data for the Skylab and Space Shuttle to television for the Space Station. Frequencies in S, C, X, and K bands (2, 5, 8, and GHz bands, respectively) are considered. Terrestrial radio-relay links may cause interference in the mission spacecraft (MS) and RS and vice versa. Possible remedies include better control of antenna sidelobes and judicious choice of channel frequencies. It is found that INTELSAT IV offers a technically feasible means of providing voice and data communications but not TV. A new dedicated satellite system can meet the requirements with two geostationary satellites both of which are visible to a single earth station (ES) in the United States. A shared satellite system, catering to other potential users as well as to manned spacecraft, offers the possibility of reduced cost to individual users. Satellite configurations for both dedicated and shared systems are presented. The satellites can be launched by boosters of the Thor-Delta class if the links between satellite and spacecraft operate in K band.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1971.8120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31141","startPage":"128","endPage":"139","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31141/01450050.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Satellite communications for manned spacecraft","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1450050/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1971","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1971","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Satellite communications for manned spacecraft","publicationDate":"Feb. 1971","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Satellite communications for manned spacecraft","sourcePdf":"01450050.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043428S","chronDate":"Feb.  1971","isNumber":"31141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"2","articleId":"1450050","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1450051,"authors":[{"name":"I.L.

Experiments were carried out in 1965-1966 to establish initial feasibility by measuring the electromagnetic noise environment in this band and the nature of the multipath occurring on the link between a satellite and a nondirectional aircraft antenna. A satellite, LES-3, was orbited in 1965 to provide a propagation signal source for the latter measurements. Two satellites, LES-5 and LES-6, were orbited in 1967 and 1968, respectively, to serve as UHF repeaters for communications experiments. A multiple-access modulation system, TATS, was developed and tested in ground and aircraft environments with these satellites. In addition, a flush-mounted, crossed-slot aircraft antenna with good coverage properties was developed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1450051/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1971","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1971","publicationDate":"Feb. 1971","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","volume":"59","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Satellite communications to mobile platforms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Satellite communications to mobile platforms","sourcePdf":"01450051.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049881S","chronDate":"Feb.  1971","isNumber":"31141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"18","articleId":"1450051","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":1450052,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Recent measurements are shown with emphasis on high and equatorial latitude observations. At high latitudes an irregularity region exists whose lower boundary reaches 57\u00b0 invariant latitude near midnight. During magnetic storms the boundary descends to lower latitudes and the fading becomes deeper. Over the polar cap scintillations are somewhat diminished. Observing synchronous satellites through the irregularity region, deep fading is seen frequently with fade rates to one per second. Irregularities produce deep scintillations in the VHF range \u00b115\u00b0 from the geomagnetic equator. In equatorial regions maximum occurrence of high level scintillations takes place between 2100 and 2400 during the equinoxes; a minimum occurrence is observed in the solstices. The data for various latitudes have been placed in statistical form, i.e., distribution of amplitudes for 15-min samples as well as for periods of one year and longer. To minimize the effect of this phenomenon on satellite transmissions, the systems designer can utilize the amplitude distributions, fading rates, and depths in designing his modulation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31141","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31141/01450052.pdf","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1971.8122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1971.8122","startPage":"159","endPage":"172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Global morphology of ionospheric scintillations","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1971","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1971","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1450052/","displayDocTitle":"Global morphology of ionospheric scintillations","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"Feb. 1971","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global morphology of ionospheric scintillations","sourcePdf":"01450052.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033925S","chronDate":"Feb.  1971","isNumber":"31141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"10","articleId":"1450052","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1450053,"authors":[{"name":"R.K.

Recent successes in the analysis of large-scale systems using network models have further enhanced the importance of the subject. A key to the understanding and analysis of nonlinear circuits is the study of nonlinear resistive networks both in theory and in computation. In the study of nonlinear resistive networks it is necessary to know the global properties of nonlinear functions. Thus Palais' global inverse function theorem is of paramount importance. In addition, a global implicit function theorem is often needed. The latter is given in this paper. We apply the global theorems to derive results on nonlinear networks with unique solutions and with multiple solutions. The theory obtained for networks with multiple solutions can be used to analyze and design bistable circuits. In computation, we extend Katzenelson's piecewise-linear analysis to general nonlinear resistive networks. For networks which have a unique solution under all possible inputs, the method converges in a finite number of steps. In addition, we present an efficient method of computing input-output characteristics of networks with single or multiple solutions.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1971.8176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31142","startPage":"340","endPage":"355","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31142/01450106.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear circuit theory: Resistive networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1450106/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1971","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1971","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear circuit theory: Resistive networks","publicationDate":"March 1971","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear circuit theory: Resistive networks","sourcePdf":"01450106.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067503S","chronDate":"March  1971","isNumber":"31142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"36","articleId":"1450106","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1450110,"authors":[{"name":"R.H.

Three classes of experiments are reported: 1) Gathering, analysis, and assessment of face-feature data for 255 faces. 2) Computer identification-studies. 3) Human identification-studies. A set of 22 features was evolved from an initially larger set to provide relevant, distinctive, relatively independent measures which can be judged reliably. Computer studies and a mathematical model established limits of performance of a person attempting to isolate a face from a population using feature descriptions. The model predicts that under certain conditions approximately 6 of an individual's features are required to isolate him from a population of 255. Human experiments under similar conditions showed unique identification occurred with an average of about 7 features. The model predicts that for a population of 4\u00d710\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">6</sup>\n, only 14 feature-descriptions are required.

Since the well-established term HOLOGRAM introduced first by Gabor implies a \"total record,\" namely of amplitude and phase, the term phase-only hologram would be contradictory. The authors propose the term PHASIGRAM for a \"phase record\" based on the Greek work \"phasis\" for phase. Sufficient resolution is present in the images obtained to allow the identification of a toy metallic gun, even when covered with a layer of clothing or synthetic leather. The phase distribution of the 70-GHz millimeter wave field scattered by the object was determined by mechanically scanning a harmonic mixer over a 0.75-m diameter circular aperture in a spiral pattern. The resulting electrical phase signal was converted to a light intensity pattern which was recorded on photographic film. A He-Ne laser was used to illuminate a reduced transparency replica of the recorded phasigrams and reconstruct the images.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1971.8441","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31148/01450371.pdf","startPage":"1383","endPage":"1384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1971.8441","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1971","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1971","displayDocTitle":"Millimeter wave holographic imaging of concealed weapons","volume":"59","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"Sept. 1971","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1450371/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimeter wave holographic imaging of concealed weapons","sourcePdf":"01450371.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029684S","chronDate":"Sept.  1971","isNumber":"31148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"54","articleId":"1450371","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":1450386,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The main emphasis is on materials that have received most attention in the tantalum film and silicon technologies in the Bell System. However, other materials that are being used are discussed. The interrelation of various factors in choosing an interconnection system is discussed. These factors include the composition of the materials, the methods of depositing various metals, and the properties of the substrates. Among the properties of the materials that are considered, emphasis is laid on environmental stability. The results of environmental tests on conductors and thin-film resistors under high-humidity conditions are reported. Some results on the use of silicone rubber as an encapsulant indicate this material is effective in reducing degradative action on hybrid circuits.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1971.8456","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31149/01450386.pdf","startPage":"1468","endPage":"1473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1971.8456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interconnection systems for solid-state components in hybrid integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1450386/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1971","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1971","displayDocTitle":"Interconnection systems for solid-state components in hybrid integrated circuits","volume":"59","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1971","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interconnection systems for solid-state components in hybrid integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"01450386.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079764S","chronDate":"Oct.  1971","isNumber":"31149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"1","articleId":"1450386","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1450401,"authors":[{"name":"J.L.

Special maximization procedures by excitation amplitude and phase adjustments, by spacing perturbation, by phase adjustments only, and by a coordinate transformation with constraints on the array pattern are examined.

This program solves for the unknowns--voltages, phase angles, etc.--of a set of simultaneous nonlinear algebraic equations, the ac power-flow equations. The optimum power flow is likely to replace, in due time, the normal power flow in many important planning functions discussed in this paper. A number of mathematical programming techniques have recently been studied to solve the optimum power flow and several small-to-medium sized experimental programs have been written. The generalized reduced gradient (GRG), one of the most elegant nonlinear-programming techniques, is described and it is shown how it can be extended to solve optimum power flows of very high dimension (of the order of several thousand nodes). This extension consists mainly of using sparsity techniques in several of the solution steps of the GRG.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1972.8558","startPage":"64","endPage":"70","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31152/01450488.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1972.8558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31152","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal power-flow solutions for power system planning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system planning","Load flow","Voltage","Nonlinear equations","Reactive power","Computational modeling","Power system simulation","Steady-state","Control systems","AC generators"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1450488/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1972","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1972","displayDocTitle":"Optimal power-flow solutions for power system planning","volume":"60","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1972","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal power-flow solutions for power system planning","sourcePdf":"01450488.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024283S","chronDate":"Jan.  1972","isNumber":"31152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"47","articleId":"1450488","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1450492,"authors":[{"name":"R.K.

The BDF method is compared to the Gear-Nordsieck method, and is shown to be more efficient, more flexible in the selection of variables for prediction and error control, and more stable under conditions of rapidly varying \u0394t. For \u0394t fixed, the two methods are equivalent but for \u0394t varying they are not equivalent. Numerical experiments are described which demonstrate that the Gear-Nordsieck and BDF methods are unstable under rapidly changing \u0394t, but BDF is more stable. The two methods are distinguished numerically by identifying the modification of the Gear-Nordsieck method which makes it equivalent to the BDF method even if \u0394t changes. The computational advantage of using backward differences \u0394x, instead of the Nordsieck vector, for storing the backward-time information is treated by giving an operations count which shows the BDF using backward \u0394x's is more efficient. Finally, additional numerical evidence is given to support the use of variable order methods and the use of higher order methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1972","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1972","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1450492/","volume":"60","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1972","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A new efficient algorithm for solving differential-algebraic systems using implicit backward differentiation formulas","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new efficient algorithm for solving differential-algebraic systems using implicit backward differentiation formulas","sourcePdf":"01450492.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041327S","chronDate":"Jan.  1972","isNumber":"31152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"154","articleId":"1450492","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1450493,"authors":[{"name":"T.J.

Magnetic cores and rotating magnetic disks were the undisputed champions. While there was no lack of alternatives in the mid 1960's, cores and disks still offered potential improvements which could not easily be challenged by other technologies. The status of computing systems has advanced to a point where currently, as in the past, larger and faster access storage is needed. While there still exists room for improvement in cores and disk technology, the tradeoffs between size, speed, and cost suggest that other technologies may now offer certain advantages. As a result, numerous technologies have appeared recently to offer alternatives for large storage systems. Some of the more notable proposed technologies currently receiving considerable attention in the published literature will be reviewed. After a discussion of the limitations and technical aspects of magnetic recording and a systems analysis of direct access storage, a review of the more advanced technologies of surface wave acoustics, magnetooptic beam addressed memories, magnetic bubbles, switchable resistances, and integrated circuit memories of various types is undertaken. A discussion of the device concept with a possible system implementation for mass storage is presented along with conceivable densities, speed, advantages and disadvantages, and inherent limitations. The essential conclusion is that when all the necessary requirements for a storage system are taken into consideration, none of the more advanced technologies have a clear-cut distinct appeal over any other. Each has its own special advantages and attraction but only at the expense of some other features, such as special operating environments (e.g., low temperature), special operating modes (e.g., shift register), a limited range of applicability, or limited potential for further improvements in performance. There remains room for other inventions, particularly for storage systems with access times considerably faster than mechanical devices (i.e., one millisecond) but slower and cheaper than commonplace electronic speeds (i.e., one microsecond). However, because of the stringent requirements imposed by storage systems and cost/performance tradeoffs, it does not appear likely that these will be forthcoming in the near future.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1450550/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1972","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1972","publicationDate":"March 1972","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","volume":"60","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Review of current proposed technologies for mass storage systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Review of current proposed technologies for mass storage systems","sourcePdf":"01450550.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089137S","chronDate":"March  1972","isNumber":"31154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"18","articleId":"1450550","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":1450577,"authors":[{"name":"W.J.

The architecture or hard-ware structure of the Illiac IV is discussed--the Illiac IV array is an array processor with a specialized control unit (CU) that can be viewed as a small stand-alone computer. The Illiac IV software strategy is described in terms of current user habits and needs. Brief descriptions are given of the systems software itself, its history, and the major lessons learned during its development. Some ideas for future development are suggested. Applications of Illiac IV are discussed in terms of evaluating the function f(x) simultaneously on up to 64 distinct argument sets x\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</inf>\n. Many of the time-consuming problems in scientific computation involve repeated evaluation of the same function on different argument sots. The argument sets which compose the problem data base must be structured in such a fashion that they can be distributed among 64 separate memories. Two matrix applications: Jacobi's algorithm for finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of real symmetric matrices, and reducing a real nonsymmetric matrix to the upper-Hessenberg form using Householder's transformations are discussed in detail. The ARPA network, a highly sophisticated and wide ranging experiment in the remote access and sharing of computer resources, is briefly described and its current status discussed. Many researchers located about the country who will use Illiac IV in solving problems will do so via the network. The various systems, hardware, and procedures they will use is discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31155/01450577.pdf","startPage":"369","endPage":"388","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1972.8647","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1972.8647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31155","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1450577","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Illiac IV system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jacobian matrices","Symmetric matrices","History","Hardware","Registers","Circuits","Military computing","System software","Application software","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1450577/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1972","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1972","displayDocTitle":"The Illiac IV system","volume":"60","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1972","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Illiac IV system","sourcePdf":"01450577.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085323S","chronDate":"April  1972","isNumber":"31155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"149","articleId":"1450577","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":1450642,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Some of these effects can be harmful to man at high radiation intensities, producing burns, cataracts, chemical changes, etc. Biological effects have been reported at lower radiation intensities, but it is not now known if low-level effects are harmful. Even behavioral changes have been reported. Most of the effects are not harmful under controlled conditions, and can thereby be used for therapeutic purposes and to make useful diagnostic measurements. The problem of microwave penetration into the body with resultant internal power absorption is approached from both the theoretical and the experimental viewpoints. The results are discussed in terms of therapeutic warming of tissues and possible hazards caused by internal \"hot spots.\" The absorption and scattering effects of light in biological tissues are reviewed. Molecular absorption peaks in the optical spectrum are useful for making molecular concentration measurements by spectroscopy. Much of the related work in the literature is summarized, some new results are presented, and several useful applications of wave energy and medical instruments are discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1450658/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1972","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1972","publicationDate":"June 1972","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","volume":"60","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Nonionizing electromagnetic wave effects in biological materials and systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonionizing electromagnetic wave effects in biological materials and systems","sourcePdf":"01450658.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091356S","chronDate":"June  1972","isNumber":"31157","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"628","articleId":"1450658","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1450674,"authors":[{"name":"D.

It is recognized that the basis of visual fidelity assessment is subjective judgement of reproduced pictures. However, in design and elsewhere there is also need for explicit evaluation of visual communication waveforms. The rate distortion theory model for such evaluations is brought out and two existing evaluations of limited scope, viz., weighted noise measurement and K rating, are reviewed in relation to that theory. It is suggested that video distortion can largely be identified with visibility of errors in reproduction. Relevant findings on luminance vision are examined. It is found that a comprehensive model of visibility would incorporate excitation, inhibition, and masking, and that considerable quantitative knowledge of these factors already exists. Looking ahead, a block schematic is given of a meter which might measure distortion produced by quantization noise in a video feed back quantizer.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1972.8776","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31158/01450706.pdf","startPage":"771","endPage":"779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1972.8776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual fidelity criterion and modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1450706","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1972","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1972","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1450706/","displayDocTitle":"Visual fidelity criterion and modeling","volume":"60","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1972","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual fidelity criterion and modeling","sourcePdf":"01450706.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062986S","chronDate":"July  1972","isNumber":"31158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"45","articleId":"1450706","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1450709,"authors":[{"name":"L.D.

The main categories of finite register length effects are errors due to A/D conversion, errors due to roundoffs in the arithmetic, constraints on signal levels imposed by the need to prevent overflow, and quantization of system coefficients. The effects of finite register length on implementations of linear recursive difference equation digital filters, and the fast Fourier transform (FFT), are discussed in some detail. For these algorithms, the differing quantization effects of fixed point, floating point, and block floating point arithmetic are examined and compared. The paper is intended primarily as a tutorial review of a subject which has received considerable attention over the past few years. The groundwork is set through a discussion of the relationship between the binary representation of numbers and truncation or rounding, and a formulation of a statistical model for arithmetic roundoff. The analyses presented here are intended to illustrate techniques of working with particular models. Results of previous work are discussed and summarized when appropriate. Some examples are presented to indicate how the results developed for simple digital filters and the FFT can be applied to the analysis of more complicated systems which use these algorithms as building blocks.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31159/01450750.pdf","startPage":"957","endPage":"976","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1972.8820","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1972.8820","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31159","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1450750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of finite register length in digital filtering and the fast Fourier transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital filters","Filtering","Fast Fourier transforms","Computer errors","Registers","Arithmetic","Quantization","Signal processing algorithms","Digital signal processing","Hardware"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1450750/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1972","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1972","displayDocTitle":"Effects of finite register length in digital filtering and the fast Fourier transform","volume":"60","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1972","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of finite register length in digital filtering and the fast Fourier transform","sourcePdf":"01450750.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067485S","chronDate":"Aug.  1972","isNumber":"31159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"235","articleId":"1450750","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1450767,"authors":[{"name":"C.L.

Particular emphasis is placed on the oscillator, frequency divider, and motor-drive circuits for quartz watches. Bipolar integrated circuits are well adapted for oscillators and motor-drive circuits producing high current pulses (1 mA). Bipolar frequency dividers with adequate power consumption are possible up to approximately 32 kHz. Complementary MOS circuits offer the important advantages of low consumption and high density of integration.

Results of measurements recently taken on dialed connections are reviewed, and it is observed that conventional random-error- or burst-error-correcting codes cannot assure reliable communication on these channels. More generally, it is shown qualitatively that automatic-repeat-request (ARQ) systems are inherently better suited to the task than forward-error-control (FEC) systems. The throughput, or effective data rate, of ARQ systems is discussed, and two basic types of ARQ systems, stop-and-wait and continuous, are compared. It is concluded that with the more common stop-and-wait system, the throughput is unsatisfactory in applications involving high transmission rates and/or long propagation delays. A brief summary of error-correcting codes suitable for use on telephone channels (when a return channel is not available for ARQ) is included. Finally, hybrid schemes where FEC systems are embedded within ARQ systems are briefly discussed.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1972.8897","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1972.8897","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31162/01450827.pdf","startPage":"1293","endPage":"1301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Errors and error control","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1450827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1972","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1972","displayDocTitle":"Errors and error control","volume":"60","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1972","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Errors and error control","sourcePdf":"01450827.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053367S","chronDate":"Nov.  1972","isNumber":"31162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"110","articleId":"1450827","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1450832,"authors":[{"name":"R.T.

Based upon the somewhat idealized Read model, this theory presents a qualitatively meaningful explanation of certain \"parametric\" effects that are often troublesome to the designers of amplifier and oscillator networks. First, an analytic treatment is given for frequency-conversion effects that appear when the device is strongly driven by one continuous signal, and simultaneously perturbed by a weak signal at another frequency or by noise. From this theory, stability criteria are derived for spurious oscillations of the \"parametric\" type which frequently appear in these devices under large-signal conditions. The noise-generation mechanism is reviewed, and it is shown that the noise is enhanced by strong signals and the spectral distribution is modified by frequency conversion. Some measurements of noise and frequency-conversion gain are presented which indicate substantial qualitative agreement with the theory.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31163","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1972.8952","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31163/01450882.pdf","startPage":"1534","endPage":"1548","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1972.8952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-signal noise, frequency conversion, and parametric instabilities in IMPATT diode networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1972","displayDocTitle":"Large-signal noise, frequency conversion, and parametric instabilities in IMPATT diode networks","volume":"60","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1972","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1450882/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1972","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-signal noise, frequency conversion, and parametric instabilities in IMPATT diode networks","sourcePdf":"01450882.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042805S","chronDate":"Dec.  1972","isNumber":"31163","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"45","articleId":"1450882","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1450883,"authors":[{"name":"R.H.

The effectiveness of digital modulation in trading bandwidth for interference protection is demonstrated in the environment of a dense urban network. The considerable benefits obtained from the use of highly directive antennas with small off-angle response are demonstrated. Effects produced by reflection and scattering from objects on or near the radio path are studied parametrically. It is concluded that very large amounts of communication can be realized in a restricted area and bandwidth if bandwidth expanding digital modulation techniques are employed in combination with high-quality antennas mounted so as to minimize effects of the environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1450988/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1973","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1973","publicationDate":"April 1973","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","volume":"61","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Efficient use of the radio spectrum and bandwidth expansion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient use of the radio spectrum and bandwidth expansion","sourcePdf":"01450988.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034756S","chronDate":"April  1973","isNumber":"31167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"11","articleId":"1450988","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1450989,"authors":[{"name":"R.D.

A frequency dmnain interpretation of the interpolation process, through which it is clear that interpolation is fundamentally a linear filtering process, is presented, An examination of the relative merits of finite duration impulse response (FIR) and infinite duration impulse response (IIR) digital filters as interpolation filters indicates that FIR filters are generally to be preferred for interpolation. It is shown that linear interpolation and classical polynomial interpolation correspond to the use of the FIR interpolation filter. The use of classical interpolation methods in signal processing applications is illustrated by a discussion of FIR interpolation filters derived from the Lagrange interpolation formula. The limitations of these filters lead us to a consideration of optimum FIR filters for interpolation that can be designed using linear programming techniques. Examples are presented to illustrate the significant improvements that are obtained using the optimum filters.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31169/01451080.pdf","startPage":"692","endPage":"702","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1973.9150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1973.9150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31169","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1451080","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A digital signal processing approach to interpolation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital signal processing","Interpolation","Finite impulse response filter","Nonlinear filters","Signal processing","Digital filters","IIR filters","Digital modulation","Modulation coding","Signal sampling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1451080/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1973","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1973","displayDocTitle":"A digital signal processing approach to interpolation","volume":"61","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1973","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A digital signal processing approach to interpolation","sourcePdf":"01451080.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039819S","chronDate":"June  1973","isNumber":"31169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"389","articleId":"1451080","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1451081,"authors":[{"name":"M.P.

The major aspects of both forward-error control (FEC) and automatic request for repeats (ARQ) are considered. Power-limited forward channels are distinguished from bandwidth-limited ones. Signal distance concepts and maximum-likelihood detection principles provide the framework for describing both block-coded and convolutional-coded signaling. Convolutional coding with Viterbi decoding appears to achieve the most cost-effective forward-error control. The improved FEC techniques benefit the transmission of real-time digitized voice and video and any communication over severely power-llmited links. ARQ methods continue to be effective and practical for most cases where the delay associated with retransmission can be tolerated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1973","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1451081/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1973","volume":"61","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1973","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Alternatives in digital communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Alternatives in digital communications","sourcePdf":"01451081.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038852S","chronDate":"June  1973","isNumber":"31169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"20","articleId":"1451081","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1451082,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Some familiarity with the basic concepts of associative-processing is assumed. The references have been divided into four groups dealing with architectural concepts, hardware implementation, software considerations, and application areas. The discussion of architectural concepts consists of a classification of associative devices into four major categories (fully parallel, bit-serial, word-serial, and block-oriented) and an enumeration of techniques for dealing with multiple responses and hardware faults. With respect to hardware implementation, considerations are given to the basic operations implemented, hardware elements used (e.g., cryoelectrics, magnetic elements, and semiconductors), and physical characteristics such as speed, size, and cost. The discussion of software aspects of associative devices deals with synthesis of algorithms, programming problems, and software simulation. The application areas discussed include solution of some mathematical systems, radar signal processing, information storage and retrieval, and performance of certain control functions in computer systems.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31169/01451082.pdf","startPage":"722","endPage":"730","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1973.9152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1973.9152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31169","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Associative memories and processors: An overview and selected bibliography","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1451082/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1973","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1973","displayDocTitle":"Associative memories and processors: An overview and selected bibliography","publicationDate":"June 1973","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Associative memories and processors: An overview and selected bibliography","sourcePdf":"01451082.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147621S","chronDate":"June  1973","isNumber":"31169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"50","articleId":"1451082","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1451084,"authors":[{"name":"R.L.

The array pattern is controlled by an adaptive feedback system based on a steepest descent minimization of mean-square error. Error is defined as the difference between the array output and a locally generated reference signal. Minimization of mean-square error is closely related to maximization of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A two-element adaptive array has been built, and its experimental performance is discussed. Typical patterns for various desired and interfering signals are shown, as well as measured transient response. Finally, some experiments showing the array behavior with modulated signals are described. The results show that such an antenna system is capable of automatically rejecting interfering signals, subject only to certain basic constraints. No a priori information about the angles of arrival of the signals is required, Detailed knowledge of the waveforms of the desired and interfering signals is also not needed, although the spectral characteristics of the desired signal must be known.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1973","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1973","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1451084/","volume":"61","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1973","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive array for interference rejection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive array for interference rejection","sourcePdf":"01451084.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047732S","chronDate":"June  1973","isNumber":"31169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"85","articleId":"1451084","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1451142,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Various acoustooptic materials are evaluated on the basis of two main factors, i.e., acoustooptic figures of merit and acoustic attenuation, as well as availability and optical quality. Guidelines for the selection of materials are discussed in some detail, although they are still insufficient for the complete prediction of new suitable materials. Elements of the acoustooptic light deflector are presented, and the importance of the fabrication techniques is stressed.

A short discussion of different types of slow-wave structures (SWS's) used as maser interaction circuits, and some design criteria are given. We briefly consider the design of the ferrimagnetic isolator. A new method for rapidly retuning the maser to within a frequency band of the order of 100 MHz is introduced. The cryogenic system and the low-noise front-end waveguide are discussed. Also some general conclusions about the TWM bandwidth and a short survey of masers for frequencies above 10 GHz are given. Finally, we discuss which types of radio-astronomical research programs could most benefit from these extremely low-noise amplifiers.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31172","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31172/01451200.pdf","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1973.9270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1973.9270","startPage":"1323","endPage":"1329","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A traveling-wave maser system for radio astronomy","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1973","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1973","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1451200/","displayDocTitle":"A traveling-wave maser system for radio astronomy","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"Sept. 1973","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A traveling-wave maser system for radio astronomy","sourcePdf":"01451200.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037628S","chronDate":"Sept.  1973","isNumber":"31172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"5","articleId":"1451200","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1451222,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Using the assumption that time constants in the oscillator circuit are small compared to the length of one beat cycle, a differential equation is derived which gives the oscillator phase as a function of time. With the aid of this equation, the transient process of \"pull-in\" as well as the production of a distorted beat note are described in detail.

For these and other reasons, it is often desirable or necessary to determine far-field antenna patterns from measurements made in the radiating near-field region; three basic techniques for accomplishing this have proven to be successful. In the first technique, the aperture phase and amplitude distributions are sampled by a scanning field probe, and then the measured distributions are transformed to the far field. In the second technique, a plane wave that is approximately uniform in amplitude is created by a feed and large reflector in the immediate vicinity of the test antenna.

Physical medicine has been a major user of both shortwave (27.33 MHz) and microwave (2450 MHz) diathermy over the decades in which the EM power has been used to heat deep tissues for stimulating various medically beneficial physiologic responses in the relief of certain pathological conditions. Experimental and clinical research indicates that these responses will occur as a result of elevating the tissue temperatures in the range 41\u00b0 to 45\u00b0C requiring absorbed power densities from 50 to 170 W/kg in the deep tissues where treatment is desired. The combination of pain responses and a large reserve of blood cooling capacity seems to be sufficient for limiting the heating to safe, but therapeutic levels in vasculated and innervated tissue. Recent research has shown that the use of the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency of 915 MHz is more efficient than the currently used 2450-MHz microwave frequency in terms of maximum power transfer to deep tissues. The results also show that in addition to thermal applications, microwave energy can be used for the controlled transcutaneous stimulation of nerve action potentials via implanted miniature microwave diodes.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31176/01451315.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"75","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1974.9385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1974.9385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31176","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1451315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Therapeutic applications of electromagnetic power","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic heating","Frequency","Ultrasonic imaging","Evolution (biology)","Pathology","Temperature distribution","Pain","Blood","Cooling","Trigeneration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1451315/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1974","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1974","displayDocTitle":"Therapeutic applications of electromagnetic power","volume":"62","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1974","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Therapeutic applications of electromagnetic power","sourcePdf":"01451315.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051947S","chronDate":"Jan.  1974","isNumber":"31176","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"228","articleId":"1451315","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1451318,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

Two candidate designs of microwave sensors (operating range 4 to 6 GHz) have been investigated for such applications. One design uses the fringing field of a low-loss dielectric slab waveguide (relative dielectric constant of 25) to obtain good resolution for finely divided soil such as bentonite clay with moisture ranging from 10 to 50 percent by dry weight for effective sample volumes of 20 to 40 cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n. The response of the dielectric waveguide sensor has been calculated in terms of the effective dielectric constant of the soil-water mixture. A model based on index of refraction yields an effective dielectric constant in reasonable agreement with experiment when effects of ionic conduction are accounted for. Another sensor design, better adapted for coarse materials, such as crushed limestone aggregate, uses waves launched from a tapered dielectric slab. By using either frequency or spatial averaging methods, the launched wave sensor accommodated aggregate particles passed by a 0.63-cm mesh sieve, and was found to have satisfactory resolution for the range of 0- to 10-percent moisture by dry weight.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1974.9388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31176","startPage":"93","endPage":"98","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31176/01451318.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High dielectric constant microwave probes for sensing soil moisture","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1451318/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1974","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1974","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"High dielectric constant microwave probes for sensing soil moisture","publicationDate":"Jan. 1974","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"62","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High dielectric constant microwave probes for sensing soil moisture","sourcePdf":"01451318.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04042S","chronDate":"Jan.  1974","isNumber":"31176","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"451","articleId":"1451318","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":1451319,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.

Propagation at these frequencies takes place in the \"waveguide\" formed between the earth and ionosphere; low propagation losses allow nearly worldwide communication from a single transmitter. Atmospheric noise at these frequencies is caused entirely by lightning; the non-Gaussian nature of this noise has important implications for receiver design and performance. Because the ratio of ELF transmitter input power to radiated power is very low, it is important that the modulation/coding technique employed make very efficient use of received signal energy. Such an efficient receiver has been implemented on a small digital computer and has been used to receive messages aboard a submarine crossing the Atlantic Ocean.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1974.9426","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31178/01451356.pdf","startPage":"292","endPage":"312","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1974.9426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Long-range communications at extremely low frequencies","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1974","displayDocTitle":"Long-range communications at extremely low frequencies","volume":"62","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1974","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1451356/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1974","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long-range communications at extremely low frequencies","sourcePdf":"01451356.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05942S","chronDate":"March  1974","isNumber":"31178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"81","articleId":"1451356","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1451368,"authors":[{"name":"E.A.

The large tablet area provides space for simultaneous use of several views of the three-dimensional object being digitized. The multiple pens enable the user to indicate a single point simultaneously in two such views, thus defining the three-dimensional position of the point. Five significant techniques are outlined. First, the large-area digitizing surface with multiple pens has proved to be an instrument very different from the more familiar single-pen small tablets. Second, a pair of two-dimensional positions is converted into a four-dimensional space and then back to three dimensions. Third, the specification of view areas, viewing directions, view positions, and coordinate axis is accomplished by giving examples directly in the viewing space rather than by specifying abstract viewing parameters. Fourth, an attitude about coordinate conversion using the inverse of a basis matrix is used throughout which automatically compensates for any tilt in the views on the tablet surface and any nonperpendicularity of the tablet axis. Fifth, the mathematics of converting from pairs of perspective views or pairs of photographs, while not new, is formulated simply in an appendix with several examples.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1974.9449","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31179/01451379.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1974.9449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31179","startPage":"453","endPage":"461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-dimensional data input by tablet","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1451379","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Three-dimensional data input by tablet","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1974","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1451379/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1974","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1974","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-dimensional data input by tablet","sourcePdf":"01451379.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075976S","chronDate":"April  1974","isNumber":"31179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"121","articleId":"1451379","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1451382,"authors":[{"name":"A. van Dam","affiliation":["Division of Applied Mathematics, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA"],"firstName":"A.","lastName":"van Dam","id":"37426649000"},{"name":"G.M.

In particular, the closely related discrete-time discrete-amplitude signal representations that are rather well known as pulse-code modulation (PCM), differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM), and delta modulation (DM) are discussed. Speech is recognized as a nonstationary signal, and emphasis is therefore placed on \"companding\" and \"adaptive\" strategies for waveform quantization and prediction. With signal-to-quantization-error ratio SNR as a performance measure, techniques are suggested which are most likely to be appropriate for given specifications of information rate. It is pointed out that error waveforms in speech quantization cannot be regarded as additive white noise, in general. This means that for finer assessments of speech coders, either relative or absolute, one needs to supplement SNR-based observations with corrections for subjective and perceptual factors. The latter seem to defy quantification as a rule. Invaluable, therefore, are explicit preference tests for direct comparisons of coders from a perceptual standpoint, and notions such as isopreference and multidimensional scaling are naturally appropriate in interpreting the results of such tests. Final points of concern are communication questions such as multiple encodings of speech by tandem coder-decoder pairs; conversions among different digital code formats; and the effects of additive and multiplicative noise in the communication channel, as manifest in the erroneous reception of speech-carrying bits. Information on these topics tends to be heterogeneous and nontheoretical, and the present digression into the subject is cursory by intent. The gramophone record accompanying this paper demonstrates some of the manipulations of speech that are discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1451414/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1974","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1974","publicationDate":"May 1974","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","volume":"62","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Digital coding of speech waveforms: PCM, DPCM, and DM quantizers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital coding of speech waveforms: PCM, DPCM, and DM quantizers","sourcePdf":"01451414.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0726S","chronDate":"May  1974","isNumber":"31180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"205","articleId":"1451414","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1451436,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

The first objective is generally impossible on Earth, but is possible on the moon because of the very low EM attenuation found in lunar rocks. A three-wavelength synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) operating at 60 m, 20 m, and 2 m (5, 15, and 150 MHz) was designed to attain these objectives. The design choices reflected a balance of scientific requirements versus Apollo mission and hard-ware constraints. The most difficult choice was that of wavelength, since longer wavelengths have the potential for deeper subsurface penetration at the expense of depth resolution. Shorter wavelengths enhance the ability to generate surface images and accurate profiles. The sounding requirement led to a system requirement for large dynamic range and precise sidelobe control. The radar data from the lunar mission were recorded on photographic film in a conventional SAR format, and were returned to Earth for processing. A combination of optical and digital processing and exploitation techniques was applied to the scientific interpretation of the data. Some preliminary results from the lunar mission have been obtained. The system design and data exploitation techniques developed in support of the ALSE experiment show considerable promise for eventual application to earth-resource survey radar systems.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1974.9517","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31181/01451447.pdf","startPage":"769","endPage":"783","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1974.9517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Apollo lunar sounder radar system","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1451447/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1974","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1974","displayDocTitle":"The Apollo lunar sounder radar system","volume":"62","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1974","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Apollo lunar sounder radar system","sourcePdf":"01451447.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042745S","chronDate":"June  1974","isNumber":"31181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"81","articleId":"1451447","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1451450,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

Considerations relating to target discrimination, weather penetration, and basic radar system parameters are covered. Modulation techniques for range determination are examined, and radar system configurations are discussed in an effort to identify the advantages and disadvantages of each.

These equations are coupled to a set of algebraic equations (two per node) which describe the network. Available programs frequently use explicit fixed step integration methods and the sequential solution of the differential and algebraic equations. Recent advances in solution methods have been directed toward implicit integration techniques and the simultaneous solution of the whole set of differential-algebraic equations.

Various methods of solution are discussed and compared.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1974.9549","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31182/01451479.pdf","startPage":"972","endPage":"982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1974.9549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Static state estimation in electric power systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1451479/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1974","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1974","displayDocTitle":"Static state estimation in electric power systems","volume":"62","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1974","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Static state estimation in electric power systems","sourcePdf":"01451479.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049331S","chronDate":"July  1974","isNumber":"31182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"223","articleId":"1451479","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1451486,"authors":[{"name":"P.T.

Direct electronic Fourier transform (DEFT) cameras employ coupling between surface strain waves, the image intensity, and electrical charge to produce electronic signals representing the spatial Fourier transform of the image at a single pair of terminals. This signal can be easily processed to accomplish pattern recognition, all-electronic image magnification (zoom) and stabilization, motion detection, and focusing. Reproduction of the image is expected to be accomplished by a light valve employing strain-induced modulation of uniform light. Experimental results for light intensity variation in one dimension are reviewed for a silicon chip bulk acoustic wave camera and for a CdS surface wave camera. Some preliminary results are also reported for a fused quartz elastobirefringent light valve image reconstruction device.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31183/01451501.pdf","startPage":"1072","endPage":"1087","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1974.9571","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1974.9571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31183","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1451501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DEFT: Direct electronic Fourier transforms of optical images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fourier transforms","Optical surface waves","Cameras","Valves","Optical imaging","Surface waves","Capacitive sensors","Signal processing","Pattern recognition","Motion detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1451501/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1974","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1974","displayDocTitle":"DEFT: Direct electronic Fourier transforms of optical images","volume":"62","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1974","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DEFT: Direct electronic Fourier transforms of optical images","sourcePdf":"01451501.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033116S","chronDate":"Aug.  1974","isNumber":"31183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"5","articleId":"1451501","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1451502,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

This diffraction coefficient remains valid in the transition regions adjacent to shadow and reflection boundaries, where the diffraction coefficients of Keller's original theory fail. Our method is based on Keller's method of the canonical problem, which in this case is the perfectly conducting wedge illuminated by plane, cylindrical, conical, and spherical waves. When the proper ray-fixed coordinate system is introduced, the dyadic diffraction coefficient for the wedge is found to be the sum of only two dyads, and it is shown that this is also true for the dyadic diffraction coefficients of higher order edges. One dyad contains the acoustic soft diffraction coefficient; the other dyad contains the acoustic hard diffraction coefficient. The expressions for the acoustic wedge diffraction coefficients contain Fresenel integrals, which ensure that the total field is continuous at shadow and reflection boundaries. The diffraction coefficients have the same form for the different types of edge illumination; only the arguments of the Fresnel integrals are different. Since diffraction is a local phenomenon, and locally the curved edge structure is wedge shaped, this result is readily extended to the curved wedge. It is interesting that even though the polarizations and the wavefront curvatures of the incident, reflected, and diffracted waves are markedly different, the total field calculated from this high-frequency solution for the curved wedge is continuous at shadow and reflection boundaries.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1974.9651","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31186/01451581.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1974.9651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31186","startPage":"1448","endPage":"1461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A uniform geometrical theory of diffraction for an edge in a perfectly conducting surface","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1451581","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A uniform geometrical theory of diffraction for an edge in a perfectly conducting surface","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1974","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1451581/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1974","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1974","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A uniform geometrical theory of diffraction for an edge in a perfectly conducting surface","sourcePdf":"01451581.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029264S","chronDate":"Nov.  1974","isNumber":"31186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"1872","articleId":"1451581","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":1451591,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Yi D.

They are applied to the problem of scattering of an evanescent plane wave by a conducting circular cylinder. This problem has an exact solution, which provides a check of the validity of complex ray tracing and suggests more general applications. An important role is played by the transformation that maps the point of reflection, on the complex extension of the scattering surface, onto the trace in real space of the complex reflected ray. For the particular problem considered, the phase and amplitude of the reflected field are computed and the \"phase paths\" and \"phase fronts\" are constructed. The reflected field and phase paths obtained in this manner are not to be taken in their entirety because some reflection points are not \"illuminated\" by the incident wave, and because the reflector may be only part of the cylinder. Tentative selection and truncation rules are used which yield good agreement with the exact solution over some regions. The disagreement, where it occurs, comes-as it does for real rays-from neglecting the diffracted field such as the creeping waves around smooth surfaces and, in the case of truncation, the edge waves from the discontinuity. Some consideration is given to scattering by an arbitrary smooth conductor.

In the infrared region of the spectrum, this is caused, for clear-sky conditions, mainly through absorption by atmospheric molecular species, i.e., the atmospheric gases. Molecular absorption is characterized by a highly variable, more-or-less random, frequency dependence which is difficult, if not impossible, to describe analytically in detail. On the other hand, most experimental work requiring an understanding of atmospheric attenuative phenomena is accomplished with instrumental spectral resolutions that are coarse enough to smooth out much of the spectral detail in molecular line structure. Therefore, methods are described for calculating atmospheric transmittance and radiance to correspond to spectral resolutions of those instruments used in remote sensing. These methods involve either numerical integration of the exact line structure over the desired spectral interval, or the use of band models derived from artificially created line structure. Limitations of these calculations are discussed in the light of factors such as the fidelity of model atmospheres used to simulate real ones and the utility of different routines regarding computer time and accuracy. A short section covers the effect of scattering.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1975.9709","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31188/01451639.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1975.9709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Methods of calculating atmospheric transmittance and radiance in the infrared","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1451639/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1975","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1975","displayDocTitle":"Methods of calculating atmospheric transmittance and radiance in the infrared","volume":"63","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1975","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Methods of calculating atmospheric transmittance and radiance in the infrared","sourcePdf":"01451639.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046531S","chronDate":"Jan.  1975","isNumber":"31188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"10","articleId":"1451639","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1451665,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.

In addition to being efficient, they have no roundoff error and do not require storage of basis functions. There is a restriction on sequence length imposed by word length and a problem with overflow but methods for overcoming these are presented.

The signal is modeled as a linear combination of its past values and present and past values of a hypothetical input to a system whose output is the given signal. In the frequency domain, this is equivalent to modeling the signal spectrum by a pole-zero spectrum. The major part of the paper is devoted to all-pole models. The model parameters are obtained by a least squares analysis in the time domain. Two methods result, depending on whether the signal is assumed to be stationary or nonstationary. The same results are then derived in the frequency domain. The resulting spectral matching formulation allows for the modeling of selected portions of a spectrum, for arbitrary spectral shaping in the frequency domain, and for the modeling of continuous as well as discrete spectra. This also leads to a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the least squares error criterion. A spectral interpretation is given to the normalized minimum prediction error.

Most stages of the exploration process have been affected: the acquisition of data, the reduction of this data in preparation for signal processing, the design of digital filters to detect primary echoes (reflections) from buried interfaces, and the development of technology to extract from these detected signals information on the geometry and physical properties of the subsurface. The seismic reflection is genenlly weak, and it must be strengthened by the use of signal summing (stacking) procedures. The determination of depths to a target horizon requires knowledge of the propagational velocities of seismic stress waves, and a wealth of technology has evolved for this purpose. More recently, it has been possible to relate signal amplitude to the physical properties of the medium traversed and, in particular, to make inferences about the oil and gas content of the buried rocks. Much of the exploration effort occurs in offshore areas, where reverberations in the water layer mask reflections from below. The method of predictive deconvolution has been most effective in its ability to attenuate these reverberations, making it possible to detect reflections from structures at depth. Seismic signal processing is neither pure science nor pure art, and offers a continuing challenge to the practitioners of both cultures.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1975.9798","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31191/01451728.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1975.9798","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","startPage":"649","endPage":"661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Seismic signal processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1451728","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1975","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1975","displayDocTitle":"Seismic signal processing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1451728/","volume":"63","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1975","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Seismic signal processing","sourcePdf":"01451728.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037202S","chronDate":"April  1975","isNumber":"31191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"78","articleId":"1451728","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1451730,"authors":[{"name":"T.G.

A variety of physical arguments are brought to bear on the question of how far miniaturization can be extended. The implications of the laws of quantum mechanics and thermodynamics for information storage are examined. The need for power dissipation in electrical information processing is demonstrated and the limits set on miniaturization by the problems of removing the heat thereby produced are estimated. limits with origins in properties of the materials used to make electronic devices are reviewed. The potential performance of various technologies based on nonsemiconductor phenomena is estimated and compared with the limits found for planar silicon technology. Attempts are made to guess at all of the many unknown parameters that enter into broadly applicable quantitative expressions of the properties of logic circuitry so that actual values of the limits can be estimated.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1975.9825","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31192/01451755.pdf","startPage":"740","endPage":"767","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1975.9825","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical limits in digital electronics","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1975","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1451755/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1975","displayDocTitle":"Physical limits in digital electronics","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","volume":"63","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1975","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical limits in digital electronics","sourcePdf":"01451755.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143261S","chronDate":"May  1975","isNumber":"31192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"224","articleId":"1451755","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1451758,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

Of particular concern are the problems of the cozrelation theory of fluctuations of irradiance propagating over large distances, where the effects of multiple scattering are greatly pronounced. Much attention is paid to the results on laser beams spread and phase fluctuations. Consideration is given to problem of the study of spatial spikes of irradiance that had passed through a turbulent media; which is comparatively new but important for practical applications. Systematic comparison of the theory with experiment is given where appropriate.

The microwave power radiated toward an earth station, being limited by factors such as available primary power and size of antenna on the satellite, is insufficient, with present technology, to overcome the large attenuation produced by intense rain cells on the earth-space path. The resultant loss of signal makes for unreliable transmission. In what follows, methods of measurement of this attenuation at various frequencies and a technique called path diversity that substantially improves the reliability are presented. Other degradations produced by rain, such as depolarization, interference, increase in earth-station noise, and deterioration of earth-station antenna performance, are also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1975.9940","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31196/01451870.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1975.9940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31196","startPage":"1308","endPage":"1331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The role of rain in satellite communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1451870","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The role of rain in satellite communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1975","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1451870/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1975","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1975","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The role of rain in satellite communications","sourcePdf":"01451870.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107356S","chronDate":"Sept.  1975","isNumber":"31196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"121","articleId":"1451870","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1451872,"authors":[{"name":"L.L.

The method uses a \"primary\" input containing the corrupted signal and a \"reference\" input containing noise correlated in some unknown way with the primary noise. The reference input is adaptively filtered and subtracted from the primary input to obtain the signal estimate. Adaptive filtering before subtraction allows the treatment of inputs that are deterministic or stochastic, stationary or time variable. Wiener solutions are developed to describe asymptotic adaptive performance and output signal-to-noise ratio for stationary stochastic inputs, including single and multiple reference inputs. These solutions show that when the reference input is free of signal and certain other conditions are met noise in the primary input can be essentiany eliminated without signal distortion. It is further shown that in treating periodic interference the adaptive noise canceller acts as a notch filter with narrow bandwidth, infinite null, and the capability of tracking the exact frequency of the interference; in this case the canceller behaves as a linear, time-invariant system, with the adaptive filter converging on a dynamic rather than a static solution. Experimental results are presented that illustrate the usefulness of the adaptive noise cancelling technique in a variety of practical applications. These applications include the cancelling of various forms of periodic interference in electrocardiography, the cancelling of periodic interference in speech signals, and the cancelling of broad-band interference in the side-lobes of an antenna array. In further experiments it is shown that a sine wave and Gaussian noise can be separated by using a reference input that is a delayed version of the primary input. Suggested applications include the elimination of tape hum or turntable rumble during the playback of recorded broad-band signals and the automatic detection of very-low-level periodic signals masked by broad-band noise.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1975.10036","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31199/01451965.pdf","startPage":"1692","endPage":"1716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1975.10036","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive noise cancelling: Principles and applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1451965","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1975","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive noise cancelling: Principles and applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1451965/","publicationDate":"Dec. 1975","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1975","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive noise cancelling: Principles and applications","sourcePdf":"01451965.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056694S","chronDate":"Dec.  1975","isNumber":"31199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"2691","articleId":"1451965","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":1452140,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Xinguang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, China"],"lastName":"Peng Xinguang","id":"37427896700"},{"name":"Zhang Zhirong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, China"],"lastName":"Zhang Zhirong","id":"37427896500"},{"name":"Wang Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, China"],"lastName":"Wang Zheng","id":"37417390500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8963-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1541-0056"}],"articleNumber":"1452140","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":28},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","Fuzzy systems","Event detection","Data security","Data mining","Object detection","Immune system","Computer science","Information security","Information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security of data","Internet","fuzzy set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","privileged program","fuzzy segments","Web system security"]}],"abstract":"Anomaly detection of privileged program is one of the most important means to ensure the security of Web systems.

The interest is fueled by results demonstrating that type-2 fuzzy sets offer a framework for effectively solving problems where uncertainties are present A concept, known as the footprint of uncertainty (FOU), is mainly responsible for the improved modeling capability of type-2 FLSs. This paper aims at providing insight into how the extra mathematical dimension provided by the FOU differentiates type-2 FLSs from type-1 FLSs. Since the input-output relationships of both types of FLS are fixed once the parameters are selected, the analysis is performed by finding a set of equivalent type-1 sets (ET1Ss) that re-produces the input-output map of a type-2 FLS. Results are presented to demonstrate that a type-2 fuzzy system is able to model more complex input-output relationship because the ET1S changes as the input varies. The technique for converting a type-2 fuzzy set into a group of type-1 sets is also useful as it provides a framework for extending the entire wealth of type-1 fuzzy control/identification/design/analysis techniques to type-2 systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Type-2 FLS Modeling Capability Analysis","publicationTitle":"The 14th IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems, 2005.

For the parameter learning, our algorithm has two advantages over the others. First, the normal methods for parameter identification are based on a fixed structure and whole data, for example ANFIS by C. F. Jang and C. Teng Lin (1998), but after clustering we know each group corresponds to one rule, so we train each rule by its group data, it is more effective.

We pay attention simultaneously to large samples, high dimensionality and multiple categories, not to only one or two terms among them. Above all, we divide a large-scale learning problem into multiple limited-scale simple problems. Each learning subset only includes a small part of samples from the original learning set. And furthermore, we propose a kind of modular single-layer RBF classifiers, in which each module is made up of multiple RBF kernels. The optimization method for determining the number, locations, widths and target values of RBF kernels is gone into details. The real output of one module is the sum of its components, and the class label of a certain sample is finally determined by the module with the maximum output. An application example, i.e., letter recognition, shows that the proposed RBF network is quite effective for solving the large-scale learning problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 May 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1452545/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8615483","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1452545/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","conferenceDate":"25-25 May 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fuzzily modular single-layer RBF neural networks for solving large-scale classification problems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzily modular single-layer RBF neural networks for solving large-scale classification problems","confLoc":"Reno, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"01452545.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118186S","chronDate":"25-25 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9859","isNumber":"31200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9859","xplore-issue":"31200","articleId":"1452545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1452567,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Theoretical analysis shows that the estimation on the linear frequency modulated (LFM) signals with time-varying amplitude is unbiased, only if the Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD) of time-varying amplitude reaches its maximum at zero frequency no matter in which time, which extends the scope of using the peak of WVD to estimate IF. The simulations using LFM signals with Gaussian envelope testify that IF can be accurately estimated using the peak of WVD. Furthermore, the statistical result of estimation on the signals with amplitude descending before rising is better than that of the signals with constant amplitude when the amplitude variation rate is moderate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1452625/","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2004","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1452625/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8402301","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Effect of amplitude variation on instantaneous frequency estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of amplitude variation on instantaneous frequency estimation","confLoc":"Beijing","sourcePdf":"01452625.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054739S","chronDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9834","isNumber":"30993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9834","xplore-issue":"30993","articleId":"1452625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1452629,"authors":[{"name":"Li Jing","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineer, Jilin University, Changhua, China"],"lastName":"Li Jing","id":"38182969800"},{"name":"Wang Shuxun","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineer, Jilin University, Changhua, China"],"lastName":"Wang Shuxun","id":"37298964400"},{"name":"Wang Fei","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineer, Jilin University, Changhua, China"],"lastName":"Wang Fei","id":"37419345800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8406-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1452629","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"abstract":"A new pseudo Wigner distribution (PWD) in the fractional Fourier transform (FT) domain is proposed to analysis single or multi-component chirp signals. A rotated short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is used to realize the proposed distribution, and the appropriate fractional domain is found from the knowledge of second-order fractional FT moments. By analyzing the signal in the most appropriate fractional domain, the proposed time-frequency distribution preserves the WD auto-terms and cancels the cross-terms when there are several signal components. The proposed method is easy to be performed without the significant additional computational costs. Simulation results confirm a qualitative advantage in the time-frequency representation, when the calculation is done in the optimal fractional domain.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 7th International Conference on Signal Processing, 2004.

The weight coefficients for the downlink beamformer are estimated by the feedback data from its uplink of the TD-SCDMA system. Simultaneously the performance analysis and the simulation results of the downlink beamformer for TD-SCDMA base stations are given. The results show that the control scheme for the smart antenna of TD-SCDMA systems can improve the performance of the systems effectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 7th International Conference on Signal Processing, 2004.

Furthermore, the mirroring effect due to the symmetry, halves the implementation effort of the remaining stages. No sorting of the data is required before or after the FFT processing, since they are all in-place.

Because of DWT's computation-intensive nature, however, it seldom meets the application of real-time video system. Field programmable gate array (FPGA) has the advantages as parallel, high-speed, and easy-modification. These merits make FPGA the appropriate choice for the DWT implementations. This paper describes an IPcore design based on hardware description language (HDL), and implemented on an FPGA device. The core uses distributed arithmetic, parallel operation, and pipelining design. In addition, the IPcore technology protects and encapsulates the design of the image compression core.","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2004.1452703","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 7th International Conference on Signal Processing, 2004.

As a time-division duplexing system, TD-SCDMA works in unpaired frequency allocations, supporting the flexible allocation of uplink/downlink slots in one carrier, and adapting to the different system loads between uplink and downlink. Dynamic time slot allocations make it more spectrally efficient than paired uplink/downlink carriers. Consequently, TD-SCDMA can make full use of the radio spectrum through optimal adaptive radio resource allocation. In order to support peak rates of 5 Mb/s or higher, the TD-SCDMA standard is enhanced via high-speed downlink packet access (HSDPA) mode. In this article the properties and strategies of radio resource management (RRM) are introduced, and the differences in admission control, power control, handover, load control, dynamic channel allocation, and adaptive HSDPA techniques between TDD-CDMA and the conventional FDD-CDMA system are analyzed. Some advanced strategies and architectures for TDD-CDMA RRM algorithms are presented. Since uplink multi-user detection (MUD) and smart antenna (SA) techniques are adopted in TD-SCDMA, the RRM algorithms based on MUD and SA are investigated further. In addition, these advanced RRM algorithms are characterized by an OPNET-based dynamical system-level simulator.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/31202/01452829.pdf","startPage":"S12","endPage":"S18","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2005.1452829","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2005.1452829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31202","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1452829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A framework for investigating radio resource management algorithms in TD-SCDMA systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Time division synchronous code division multiple access","Downlink","Multiuser detection","Multiaccess communication","Radio spectrum management","Admission control","Power control","Load flow control","Channel allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication network management","code division multiple access","time division multiple access","3G mobile communication","frequency allocation","radio links","packet radio networks","telecommunication congestion control","power control","channel allocation","adaptive antenna arrays","multiuser detection","time division multiplexing","frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio resource management algorithm","TD-SCDMA system","asymmetrical 3G mobile service","symmetrical 3G mobile service","time-division duplexing system","frequency allocation","dynamic time slot allocation","uplink-downlink carrier","adaptive radio resource allocation","high-speed downlink packet access","admission control","power control","load control","dynamic channel allocation","multiuser detection","smart antenna technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1452829/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"A framework for investigating radio resource management algorithms in TD-SCDMA systems","volume":"43","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1452829/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2005","accessionNumber":"8467101","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A framework for investigating radio resource management algorithms in TD-SCDMA systems","sourcePdf":"01452829.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033933S","chronDate":"June  2005","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"31202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"31202","articleId":"1452829","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1452830,"authors":[{"name":"Li Ping","affiliation":["City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"p":["Li Ping (eeliping@cityu.edu.hk) received his Ph.D. degree at Glasgow University in 1990.

This has the particular advantage of high data rates and unlicensed spectrum. Consequently, network selection techniques play a vital role in ensuring quality of service in heterogeneous networks. In this article we develop a network selection scheme for an integrated cellular/wireless LAN system. The design goal is to provide the user the best available QoS at any time. The proposed scheme comprises two parts, with the first applying an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to decide the relative weights of evaluative criteria set according to user preferences and service applications, while the second adopts grey relational analysis (GRA) to rank the network alternatives with faster and simpler implementation than AHP. Simulations conducted in a heterogeneous system with UMTS and wireless LAN reveal that the proposed network selection technique can effectively decide the optimum network through making trade-offs among network condition, user preference, and service application, while avoiding frequent handoffs.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2005.1452853","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/31203/01452853.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"48","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2005.1452853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network selection in an integrated wireless LAN and UMTS environment using mathematical modeling and computing techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1452853","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1452853/","displayDocTitle":"Network selection in an integrated wireless LAN and UMTS environment using mathematical modeling and computing techniques","volume":"12","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2005","accessionNumber":"8492484","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1452853/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network selection in an integrated wireless LAN and UMTS environment using mathematical modeling and computing techniques","sourcePdf":"01452853.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08801S","chronDate":"June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"31203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"257","xplore-issue":"31203","articleId":"1452853","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1452883,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

The key components of the controller are new digital pulse-width modulator (DPWM), which is based on multi-bit sigma-delta (Sigma-Delta) concept, and a dual-sampling mode PID compensator. Depending on the conditions in the converter circuit, the output voltage is either sampled at a frequency lower than the switching frequency or at the switching rate. The undersampling, which is used in steady-state, minimizes power consumption of the controller. During transients, to achieve fast dynamic response, the controller samples at the switching rate. Operation of the controller is verified with an experimental FPGA system and an integrated circuit (IC), which utilizes the Sigma-Delta DPWM architecture, is designed. Pulse-with modulated signals produced by the new IC at frequency of 115 MHz are obtained and closed loop operation with a 2 W buck dc-dc that switches at 2 MHz is demonstrated","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-frequency digital controller for dc-dc converters based on multi-bit /spl Sigma/-/spl Delta/ pulse-width modulation","publicationTitle":"Twentieth Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition, 2005.

Furthermore, they can be used for very different functions within the same circuits, from primary side switch, to secondary synchronous rectifier, to DC load management. Modes of operations include both hard switching and soft switching, while the switching frequency varies from DC all the way up to a Mega Hertz. It is always possible to optimize power MOSFET for each unique socket and application. However, this approach is very costly and time consuming, and can result in a large number of custom parts with very limited usability. The optimization effort for single application can significantly slow the rate at which new, fundamentally better technologies are developed and applied. In this paper, the development of a new generation mid-voltage MOSFET technology covering multiple emerging applications is described. The basic methodology is based on advanced loss modeling of typical applications to find the optimized designs. Optimized designs are compared in terms of power loss and cost, and then consolidated into a single design with optimized cell density. The best tradeoff of power loss and cost was achieved for individual application by varying the active areas of the die. The optimized designs are experimentally verified","publicationTitle":"Twentieth Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition, 2005.

The active switch in the converter can sustain a long enough duty cycle while it operates with a high step-down voltage ratio, reducing current stress significantly. In the converter, the active-clamp circuit is used to eliminate voltage spike induced from the leakage inductor of the coupled inductors. Moreover, since both main and auxiliary switches can be turned on with zero voltage switching, switching loss can be reduced and conversion efficiency therefore can be improved significantly. A 120 W prototype of the proposed buck converter was built and experimental results have shown that efficiency can reach as high as 95% (power stage only) and surge can be suppressed effectively. It is relatively feasible for applications to hybrid electric vehicle on-board chargers.","doi":"10.1109/APEC.2005.1452962","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.2005.1452962","startPage":"399","endPage":"405 Vol. 1","displayPublicationTitle":"Twentieth Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition, 2005.

Abilities of constant input power and lamp power are required for the self-oscillating ballast. The conventional self-oscillating electronic ballast is disadvantageous because the input power and lamp power vary according to the input voltage. This difference in lamp power causes poor quality of illumination for the lamp. In order to solve the problems of the self-oscillating electronic ballast, a constant-power control circuit is proposed to provide constant input power and lamp power. In this paper, a 38 W self-oscillating ballast with the constant-control circuit is implemented.

The high switching losses inherent to the high frequency operation are minimized using a class E resonant inverter. A low cost phase-locked-loop circuit is used for stabilizing the operating point of the inverter. This control circuit modifies the switching frequency within a narrow range to keep a constant phase shift between the lamp voltage and the inverter control signal. The high voltage pulse required to start the lamp is provided by the output resonant filter of the class E inverter without using additional starting circuitry.

One of the key points for a proper implementation of an active filter is to use a good method for current/voltage reference generation. There exist many implementations supported by different theories (either in time- or frequency-domain), which continuously debate their performances proposing ever better solutions. This paper gives a survey of the common used theories. Then, the work here proposes a simulation setup that decouples the harmonic reference generator from the active filter model and its controller. In this way the selected methods can be equally analyzed and compared with respect to their performance, which helps anticipating possible implementation issues. The conclusions are collected and a comparison is given at the end, which is useful in deciding the future hardware setup implementation. The comparison shows that the choice of numerical filtering is a key factor for obtaining good accuracies and dynamics for an active filter.","doi":"10.1109/APEC.2005.1453014","publicationTitle":"Twentieth Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition, 2005.

In particular, the current ringing phenomenon, having an important influence on the short circuit behaviour of the IGBTs, has been investigated by taking in account for the gate driving conditions. A suitable circuit which performs the fault protection of IGBTs by taking into account for the large voltage spikes and oscillations at turn-off is proposed. Due to such an influence of current oscillations on the collector voltage of the IGBT, a low-pass filter designed at the gate side of the device has been provided to damp the gate voltage oscillations and, consequently, the collector voltage ringing. By this way, full protection of the IGBT in short-circuit conditions has been successfully achieved","displayPublicationTitle":"Twentieth Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition, 2005.

The duty cycle required to achieve unity power factor consists of two terms: current term and voltage term. They are calculated directly based on the reference current and sensed inductor current, input voltage and output voltage. It requires only one multiplication and three addition operations for digital implementation so that the proposed PFC control method can be implemented by a low cost DSP, microprocessor, FPGA or an ASIC to achieve high switching frequency. This duty cycle parallel control essentially distinguishes from the conventional current mode control in which there are two regulators, one for voltage regulation and one for current regulation. Test results for a digital PFC implementation show that the proposed method can achieve unity power factor under both steady and transient state. Sinusoidal input current can be achieved under nonsinusoidal input voltage condition. The switching frequency of FPGA control boost PFC is 400 kHz. The proposed duty cycle parallel control strategy has high potential for the next generation of high switching frequency PFC implementation, due to its lower calculation requirement, lower cost and better performance than average current mode control","displayPublicationTitle":"Twentieth Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition, 2005.

This paper presents a low-cost, soft-switched, bidirectional DC/DC converter for connecting the three voltage nets. The converter consists of two half-brides and a high-frequency transformer, which provides voltage level matching and galvanic isolation between the two half-bridges for safety requirements. The use of dual half-bridges minimizes the number of switching devices and their associated gate drive components. Moreover, snubber capacitors and the transformer leakage inductance are utilized to achieve soft-switching. Therefore, no extra active switches or passive resonant components are required for softswitching, further reducing component count. Control of power flow among the three voltage buses is achieved by adjusting the duty ratio and phase angle between the half-bridge output voltages. Simulation and experimental data on a 2 kW lab unit are included to verify the power flow control scheme","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453116/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 March 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 March 2005","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1453116/","accessionNumber":"8538879","displayDocTitle":"A low cost, triple-voltage bus DC-DC converter for automotive applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low cost, triple-voltage bus DC-DC converter for automotive applications","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01453116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042855S","chronDate":"6-10 March 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9847","isNumber":"31030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9847","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"31030","articleId":"1453116","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1453123,"authors":[{"name":"Yongbing Yang","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Yongbing Yang","id":"37087613373"},{"name":"Zhaoming Qian","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Zhaoming Qian","id":"37087146203"},{"name":"Xinke Wu","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Xinke Wu","id":"37087206822"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8975-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1048-2334"}],"articleNumber":"1453123","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel single-stage low-frequency square-wave electronic ballast for low-wattage HID lamps","abstract":"A novel single-stage electronic ballast for low-wattage HID lamps is presented in this paper.

Furthermore, the proposed converter can eliminate potential flux-imbalance problems existing in the conventional push-pull converter.

In this paper, modeling of both the cold cathode fluorescent lamp and the backlight inverter is performed in terms of incremental impedance in the frequency domain. The stability analysis of the backlight inverter and the CCFL is presented using the derived models. It is concluded that the time delay, after which the lamp voltage responds to the lamp current change, contributes to the incremental impedance of the CCFL at the high frequency region, which may cause instability of the backlight inverter. The time delay is considered as a lamp characteristic. The effect of the inverter design parameters on the stability is also investigated.

In this article we propose a novel directional transmit and receive algorithm (DTRA) in wireless local area networks with directional antennas for quality of service support. To the best of our knowledge, all the previous work assumes omnidirectional reception at certain stages of the algorithms. However, the omnireceive requirement makes the protocol vulnerable to jamming. In this article no omniantennas or omnidirectional reception capability is assumed at all. The proposed algorithm exploits the beamforming capabilities of smart antennas to tailor resource access according to the services desired for individual traffic flows while limiting interference, probability of detection, and jamming in the network. Specifically, we present a TDMA-based MAC algorithm for load-dependent negotiation of slot reservations. Our new protocol offers four significant advantages: it assumes directional transmission/reception, it is distributed (i.e., it relies on local information only), it allocates slots to different links dynamically based on demand, and power control is easily carried out during neighbor discovery, reservation, and data transmission with very little overhead. We believe this is the first work on pure directional transmission and reception in wireless ad hoc networks. The algorithm can be used in many commercial and military applications. Preliminary simulation results indicate that DTRA performs much better than IEEE 802.11 for the network considered.","doi":"10.1109/MNET.2005.1453396","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","pdfPath":"/iel5/65/31204/01453396.pdf","startPage":"27","endPage":"32","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MNET.2005.1453396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DTRA: directional transmission and reception algorithms in WLANs with directional antennas for QoS support","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1453396","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453396/","displayDocTitle":"DTRA: directional transmission and reception algorithms in WLANs with directional antennas for QoS support","volume":"19","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May-June 2005","accessionNumber":"8442508","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1453396/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DTRA: directional transmission and reception algorithms in WLANs with directional antennas for QoS support","sourcePdf":"01453396.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058713S","chronDate":"May-June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"65","isNumber":"31204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"31204","articleId":"1453396","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1453413,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

The basic spectrum management structure in all countries was developed over a long period, and much of the basic framework has remained stable for decades. The FCC is interested in making more spectrum available to unlicensed devices because of the explosive growth of IEEE 802.11/Wi-Fi unlicensed wireless LAN technology, and because the FCC recognizes that there is a great deal of \"white space\" that could be exploited by unlicensed devices. The FCC proposal selected the TV bands as an initial home for cognitive radio based on several factors. First, the frequencies used for TV can give greater range in rural areas than the microwave frequencies used for Wi-Fi, and can also give better building penetration than Wi-Fi in all areas. Second, TV broadcast systems usually use high antennas, and the intended receivers need greater than 10 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to function. A variety of controversial issues have emerged from public comments. One concern is that the confusion resulting from the proposal might discourage purchase of new digital televisions and hence delay the transition from analog to digital televisions. This would also delay the transfer of some current TV spectrum to new mobile uses, including public safety.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453413/","volume":"43","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1453413/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8430967","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2005","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Unlicensed cognitive sharing of TV spectrum: the controversy at the Federal Communications Commission","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unlicensed cognitive sharing of TV spectrum: the controversy at the Federal Communications Commission","sourcePdf":"01453413.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023322S","chronDate":"May  2005","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"31205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"31205","articleId":"1453413","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1453429,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Ni","affiliation":["Yale University, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Jian Ni (jian.ni@yale.edu) received his B.Eng. degree in automation from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2001, and his M.Phil. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2003.

Many researchers have attempted to study the relationship between the space charge and the breakdown; however, it has not been clarified yet. Although the pulsed electroacoustic (PEA) method has been widely used to observe space charge profiles, previous works have not shown clear evidence of the influence of the space charge on the breakdown. Therefore, we have developed a new PEA system with an interval of 0.5 ms to observe the space charge distribution continuously under the ultra-high electric field. Using this system, we observed the space charge dynamics in the low-density polyethylene (LDPE) at and around the breakdown. We also investigated the dependence of the applied electric field on space charge behavior. From the results, it is found that the injected charge packet moved faster and deeper under a relatively lower electric field rather than that under a higher electric field. Furthermore, we found that the maximum electric field in each specimen was almost the same when the breakdown happened in a specimen.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453444/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1453444/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","publicationDate":"June 2005","accessionNumber":"8472228","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Space charge behavior in low density polyethylene at pre-breakdown","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space charge behavior in low density polyethylene at pre-breakdown","sourcePdf":"01453444.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062163S","chronDate":"June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"31211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"198","xplore-issue":"31211","articleId":"1453444","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1453464,"authors":[{"name":"X.

However, the method is more complex than the Fourier transform (FT), and requires expertise and experience to be applied to produce its best effect. The authors have previously published algorithms for selection of the most appropriate mother wavelet and for automatic determination of threshold values for applying the WT to PD measurement denoising. The present paper is to present an improved methodology to apply the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with better denoising effect to PD measurement. Firstly the paper describes the structure of DWT's filter pairs. It then analyses the frequency bands of the wavelet coefficients in approximations and details, and energy distribution of a PD signal along each of the levels following the DWT. Finally a DWT-based denoising method is proposed and justified. Results prove that, with the proposed methodology, in conjunction with the algorithms proposed by the authors to select optimal mother wavelet and threshold values, significant improvement in denoising effect can be achieved.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/31211/01453464.pdf","startPage":"586","endPage":"594","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2005.1453464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2005.1453464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31211","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1453464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved methodology for application of wavelet transform to partial discharge measurement denoising","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Partial discharge measurement","Noise reduction","Discrete wavelet transforms","Partial discharges","Fourier transforms","Filters","Signal analysis","Frequency","Wavelet coefficients"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial discharge measurement","discrete wavelet transforms","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transform","partial discharge measurement","PD","Fourier transform","FT","discrete wavelet transform","frequency bands","energy distribution","denoising method","optimal mother wavelet","threshold values"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453464/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"An improved methodology for application of wavelet transform to partial discharge measurement denoising","volume":"12","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1453464/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2005","accessionNumber":"8472240","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved methodology for application of wavelet transform to partial discharge measurement denoising","sourcePdf":"01453464.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046832S","chronDate":"June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"31211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"138","xplore-issue":"31211","articleId":"1453464","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":1453484,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Consequently, new specifications for decimal floating-point arithmetic have been added to the draft revision of the IEEE-754 Standard for floating-point arithmetic. This paper introduces and analyzes three techniques for performing fast decimal addition on multiple binary coded decimal (BCD) operands. Two of the techniques speculate BCD correction values and correct intermediate results while adding the input operands. The first speculates over one addition. The second speculates over two additions. The third technique uses a binary carry-save adder tree and produces a binary sum. Combinational logic is then used to correct the sum and determine the carry into the next more significant digit. Multioperand adder designs are constructed and synthesized for four to 16 input operands. Analyses are performed on the synthesis results and the merits of each technique are discussed. Finally, these techniques are compared to several previous techniques for high-speed decimal addition.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-speed multioperand decimal adders","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.2005.129","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/31214/01453497.pdf","startPage":"953","endPage":"963","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2005.129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31214","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1453497","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453497/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 2005","displayDocTitle":"High-speed multioperand decimal adders","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/1453497/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","publicationDate":"Aug. 2005","accessionNumber":"8525248","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-speed multioperand decimal adders","sourcePdf":"01453497.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055849S","chronDate":"Aug. 2005","isNumber":"31214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"61","articleId":"1453497","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1453503,"authors":[{"name":"Partha Pratim Pande","affiliation":["SOC Research Lab, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/31214/1453503/1453503-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Partha Pratim Pande is completing his PhD degree studies in VLSI design at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Canada.

Power and wire design constraints are forcing the adoption of new design methodologies for system-on-chip (SoC), namely, those that incorporate modularity and explicit parallelism. To enable these MP-SoC platforms, researchers have recently pursued scaleable communication-centric interconnect fabrics, such as networks-on-chip (NoC), which possess many features that are particularly attractive for these. These communication-centric interconnect fabrics are characterized by different trade-offs with regard to latency, throughput, energy dissipation, and silicon area requirements. In this paper, we develop a consistent and meaningful evaluation methodology to compare the performance and characteristics of a variety of NoC architectures. We also explore design trade-offs that characterize the NoC approach and obtain comparative results for a number of common NoC topologies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort in characterizing different NoC architectures with respect to their performance and design trade-offs. To further illustrate our evaluation methodology, we map a typical multiprocessing platform to different NoC interconnect architectures and show how the system performance is affected by these design trade-offs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453503/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 2005","volume":"54","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8525254","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","publicationDate":"Aug. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1453503/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation and design trade-offs for network-on-chip interconnect architectures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation and design trade-offs for network-on-chip interconnect architectures","sourcePdf":"01453503.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125801S","chronDate":"Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"31214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"563","xplore-issue":"31214","articleId":"1453503","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1453510,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The first step in providing recognition/retrieval tools is to automatically segment handwritten pages into words. State of the art segmentation techniques like the gap metrics algorithm have been mostly developed and tested on highly constrained documents like bank checks and postal addresses. There has been little work on full handwritten pages and this work has usually involved testing on clean artificial documents created for the purpose of research. Historical manuscript images, on the other hand, contain a great deal of noise and are much more challenging. Here, a novel scale space algorithm for automatically segmenting handwritten (historical) documents into words is described. First, the page is cleaned to remove margins. This is followed by a gray-level projection profile algorithm for finding lines in images. Each line image is then filtered with an anisotropic Laplacian at several scales. This procedure produces blobs which correspond to portions of characters at small scales and to words at larger scales. Crucial to the algorithm is scale selection that is, finding the optimum scale at which blobs correspond to words. This is done by finding the maximum over scale of the extent or area of the blobs. This scale maximum is estimated using three different approaches. The blobs recovered at the optimum scale are then bounded with a rectangular box to recover the words. A post processing filtering step is performed to eliminate boxes of unusual size which are unlikely to correspond to words. The approach is tested on a number of different data sets and it is shown that, on 100 sampled documents from the George Washington corpus of handwritten document images, a total error rate of 17 percent is observed. The technique outperforms a state-of-the-art gap metrics word-segmentation algorithm on this collection.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2005.150","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/31215/01453510.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2005.150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31215","startPage":"1212","endPage":"1225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A scale space approach for automatically segmenting words from historical handwritten documents","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1453510","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A scale space approach for automatically segmenting words from historical handwritten documents","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453510/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2005","accessionNumber":"8507963","pubMedId":"16119261","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1453510/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A scale space approach for automatically segmenting words from historical handwritten documents","sourcePdf":"01453510.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101182S","chronDate":"Aug.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"31215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"31215","articleId":"1453510","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1453511,"authors":[{"name":"Hanchuan Peng","affiliation":["Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/31215/1453511/1453511-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hanchuan Peng received the PhD degree in biomedical engineering from Southeast University, China, in 1999.

Because of the difficulty in directly implementing the maximal dependency condition, we first derive an equivalent form, called minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance criterion (mRMR), for first-order incremental feature selection. Then, we present a two-stage feature selection algorithm by combining mRMR and other more sophisticated feature selectors (e.g., wrappers). This allows us to select a compact set of superior features at very low cost. We perform extensive experimental comparison of our algorithm and other methods using three different classifiers (naive Bayes, support vector machine, and linear discriminate analysis) and four different data sets (handwritten digits, arrhythmia, NCI cancer cell lines, and lymphoma tissues).

For such problems, the Gibbs sampler provides a general solution but is very slow, while other methods, such as Ncut and graph cuts are computationally effective but only work for specific energy forms and are not generally applicable. In this paper, we present a new inference algorithm that generalizes the Swendsen-Wang method to arbitrary probabilities defined on graph partitions. We begin by computing graph edge weights, based on local image features. Then, the algorithm iterates two steps: (1) graph clustering - it forms connected components by cutting the edges probabilistically based on their weights; (2) graph relabeling - it selects one connected component and flips probabilistically, the coloring of all vertices in the component simultaneously. Thus, it realizes the split, merge, and regrouping of a \"chunk\" of the graph, in contrast to Gibbs sampler that flips a single vertex. We prove that this algorithm simulates ergodic and reversible Markov chain jumps in the space of graph partitions and is applicable to arbitrary posterior probabilities or energy functions defined on graphs. We demonstrate the algorithm on two typical problems in computer vision-image segmentation and stereo vision. Experimentally, we show that it is 100-400 times faster in CPU time than the classical Gibbs sampler and 20-40 times faster then the DDMCMC segmentation algorithm. For stereo, we compare performance with graph cuts and belief propagation. We also show that our algorithm can automatically infer generative models and obtain satisfactory results (better than the graphic cuts or belief propagation) in the same amount of time.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2005.161","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/31215/01453512.pdf","startPage":"1239","endPage":"1253","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2005.161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalizing Swendsen-Wang to sampling arbitrary posterior probabilities","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2005","displayDocTitle":"Generalizing Swendsen-Wang to sampling arbitrary posterior probabilities","volume":"27","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/1453512/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2005","accessionNumber":"8507964","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","pubMedId":"16119263","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453512/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalizing Swendsen-Wang to sampling arbitrary posterior probabilities","sourcePdf":"01453512.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090332S","chronDate":"Aug.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"31215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"31215","articleId":"1453512","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1453513,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It has been shown that object recognizers using kernel-SVMs can be elegantly adapted to localization by means of spatial perturbation of the SVM. While this SVM applies to each frame of a video independently of other frames, the benefits of temporal fusion of data are well-known. This is addressed here by using a fully probabilistic relevance vector machine (RVM) to generate observations with Gaussian distributions that can be fused over time. Rather than adapting a recognizer, we build a displacement expert which directly estimates displacement from the target region. An object detector is used in tandem, for object verification, providing the capability for automatic initialization and recovery. This approach is demonstrated in real-time tracking systems where the sparsity of the RVM means that only a fraction of CPU time is required to track at frame rate. An experimental evaluation compares this approach to the state of the art showing it to be a viable method for long-term region tracking.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Bayesian learning for efficient visual tracking","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2005.167","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/31215/01453516.pdf","startPage":"1292","endPage":"1304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2005.167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31215","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1453516","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453516/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2005","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Bayesian learning for efficient visual tracking","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/1453516/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","publicationDate":"Aug. 2005","accessionNumber":"8507968","pubMedId":"16119267","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Bayesian learning for efficient visual tracking","sourcePdf":"01453516.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077644S","chronDate":"Aug.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"31215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"149","xplore-issue":"31215","articleId":"1453516","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1453520,"authors":[{"name":"Liwei Wang","affiliation":["Center for Information Sciences, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Liwei Wang","id":"37423373800"},{"name":"Yan Zhang","affiliation":["Center for Information Sciences, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yan Zhang","id":"37422594100"},{"name":"Jufu Feng","affiliation":["Center for Information Sciences, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jufu Feng","id":"37332209100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"1453520","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":278,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":6707},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1453520","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Euclidean distance","Robustness","Image recognition","Image classification","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Linear discriminant analysis","Principal component analysis","Smoothing methods","Face recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","geometry","visual databases","computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image Euclidean distance","image recognition","image classification techniques","face recognition technology database","state-of-the-art face identification algorithms","transform domain smoothing","standardizing transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Index Terms- Image metric","Euclidean distance","face recognition","positive definite function."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Biometry","Cluster Analysis","Computer Simulation","Face","Humans","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Information Storage and Retrieval","Models, Biological","Models, Statistical","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Subtraction Technique"]}],"abstract":"We present a new Euclidean distance for images, which we call image Euclidean distance (IMED).

We argue that IMED is the only intuitively reasonable Euclidean distance for images. IMED is then applied to image recognition. The key advantage of this distance measure is that it can be embedded in most image classification techniques such as SVM, LDA, and PCA. The embedding is rather efficient by involving a transformation referred to as standardizing transform (ST). We show that ST is a transform domain smoothing.

The population-based stochastic search of the GA explores the search space more thoroughly than the EM method. Therefore, our algorithm enables escaping from local optimal solutions since the algorithm becomes less sensitive to its initialization. The GA-EM algorithm is elitist which maintains the monotonic convergence property of the EM algorithm. The experiments on simulated and real data show that the GA-EM outperforms the EM method since: (1) we have obtained a better MDL score while using exactly the same termination condition for both algorithms; (2) our approach identifies the number of components which were used to generate the underlying data more often than the EM algorithm.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2005.162","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2005.162","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/31215/01453522.pdf","startPage":"1344","endPage":"1348","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic-based EM algorithm for learning Gaussian mixture models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic-based EM algorithm for learning Gaussian mixture models","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453522/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2005","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2005","accessionNumber":"8507970","pubMedId":"16119273","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1453522/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic-based EM algorithm for learning Gaussian mixture models","sourcePdf":"01453522.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052068S","chronDate":"Aug.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"31215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"155","xplore-issue":"31215","articleId":"1453522","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1453528,"authors":[{"name":"P.C. van Oorschot","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8858/31216/1453528/1453528-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Paul C. van Oorschot received the BMath (1984), MMath (1986), and PhD (1988) degrees in computer science from the University of Waterloo, Canada.

We present a general description of the attack strategy and multiple attack implementations that exploit different processor features. Each of these implementations is generic in that it can defeat self-hashing employed by any user-space program on a single platform. Together, these implementations defeat self-hashing on most modern general-purpose processors.

This phenomenon, which may eventually lead to system performance degradation and/or crash/hang failure, is the result of exhaustion of operating system resources, data corruption, and numerical error accumulation. To counteract software aging, a technique called software rejuvenation has been proposed, which essentially involves occasionally terminating an application or a system, cleaning its internal state and/or its environment, and restarting it. Since rejuvenation incurs an overhead, an important research issue is to determine optimal times to initiate this action. In this paper, we first describe how to include faults attributed to software aging in the framework of Gray's software fault classification (deterministic and transient), and study the treatment and recovery strategies for each of the fault classes. We then construct a semi-Markov reward model based on workload and resource usage data collected from the UNIX operating system. We identify different workload states using statistical cluster analysis, estimate transition probabilities, and sojourn time distributions from the data. Corresponding to each resource, a reward function is then defined for the model based on the rate of resource depletion in each state. The model is then solved to obtain estimated times to exhaustion for each resource. The result from the semi-Markov reward model are then fed into a higher-level availability model that accounts for failure followed by reactive recovery, as well as proactive recovery. This comprehensive model is then used to derive optimal rejuvenation schedules that maximize availability or minimize downtime cost.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/8858/31216/01453531.pdf","startPage":"124","endPage":"137","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","doi":"10.1109/TDSC.2005.15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDSC.2005.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31216","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1453531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comprehensive model for software rejuvenation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aging","Degradation","Operating systems","Availability","Software systems","System performance","Computer crashes","Application software","Cleaning","State estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software maintenance","software reliability","software fault tolerance","Markov processes","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software rejuvenation","software aging","system performance degradation","crash-hang failure","operating system resources","data corruption","numerical error accumulation","Gray software fault classification","semi-Markov reward model","UNIX operating system","statistical cluster analysis","estimate transition probabilities","sojourn time distributions","higher-level availability model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Index Terms- Availability","measurement-based dependability evaluation","semi-Markov reward models","software aging","software rejuvenation","workload characterization."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453531/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"A comprehensive model for software rejuvenation","volume":"2","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1453531/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April-June 2005","accessionNumber":"8516392","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comprehensive model for software rejuvenation","sourcePdf":"01453531.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152645S","chronDate":"April-June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"31216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"173","xplore-issue":"31216","articleId":"1453531","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1453542,"authors":[{"name":"M.F.

The charge control feedback loop is analyzed in detail. It incorporates an operational amplifier to provide high loop gain, a high-voltage amplifier (HVA) to drive the stack actuator, and a lead compensator to ensure stability. Experiments were conducted to compare the responses of the stack actuator under voltage and charge control.

Usually, initial designs obtained by all means need to be adjusted repeatedly through computer simulations until the closed-loop system performs or compromises as desired. This stimulates the development of \"intelligent\" tools that can assist engineers to achieve the best overall PID control for the entire operating envelope. This development has further led to the incorporation of some advanced tuning algorithms into PID hardware modules. Corresponding to these developments, this paper presents a modern overview of functionalities and tuning methods in patents, software packages and commercial hardware modules. It is seen that many PID variants have been developed in order to improve transient performance, but standardising and modularising PID control are desired, although challenging. The inclusion of system identification and \"intelligent\" techniques in software based PID systems helps automate the entire design and tuning process to a useful degree. This should also assist future development of \"plug-and-play\" PID controllers that are widely applicable and can be set up easily and operate optimally for enhanced productivity, improved quality and reduced maintenance requirements.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2005.847331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2005.847331","startPage":"559","endPage":"576","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/31218/01453566.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PID control system analysis, design, and technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453566/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"PID control system analysis, design, and technology","volume":"13","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","accessionNumber":"8485855","publicationDate":"July 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1453566/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PID control system analysis, design, and technology","sourcePdf":"01453566.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105295S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"31218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"1266","xplore-issue":"31218","articleId":"1453566","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":1453569,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Min Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chih-Min Lin","id":"37087067551"},{"name":"Yi-Jen Mon","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Chung-Kuo Institute of Technology, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yi-Jen Mon","id":"37087171174"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6536"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0865"},{"format":"CD","value":"2374-0159"}],"articleNumber":"1453569","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":113,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1485},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1453569","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoupling control by hierarchical fuzzy sliding-mode controller","abstract":"A design method using hierarchical fuzzy sliding-mode (HFSM) decoupling control is proposed to achieve system stability and favorable decoupling performance for a class of nonlinear systems. In this approach, the nonlinear system is decoupled into several subsystems and the state response of each subsystem can be designed to be governed by a corresponding sliding surface. Then the whole system is controlled by a hierarchical sliding-mode controller. In this design, an adaptive law is derived based on the Lyapunov function to tune the coupling factor of the hierarchical sliding-mode controller so as to achieve favorable decoupling performance with guaranteed stability. The proposed design method is applied to investigate the decoupling control of a double inverted pendulum system. Simulations are performed and a comparison between the proposed HFSM decoupling control and a conventional fuzzy sliding-mode (FSM) decoupling control is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2004.843130","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","startPage":"593","endPage":"598","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2004.843130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31218","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/31218/01453569.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sliding mode control","Fuzzy control","Control systems","Design methodology","Stability","Nonlinear systems","Fuzzy systems","Nonlinear control systems","Programmable control","Adaptive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","variable structure systems","stability","Lyapunov methods","control system synthesis","nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoupling control","hierarchical fuzzy sliding-mode controller","system stability","nonlinear systems","Lyapunov function","double inverted pendulum system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive law","decoupling control","fuzzy control","hierarchical sliding-mode control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Decoupling control by hierarchical fuzzy sliding-mode controller","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453569/","volume":"13","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1453569/","accessionNumber":"8485858","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","publicationDate":"July 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoupling control by hierarchical fuzzy sliding-mode controller","sourcePdf":"01453569.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047186S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"31218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"31218","articleId":"1453569","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1453571,"authors":[{"name":"Tzyh-Jong Tarn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University, Saint Louis, MO, USA"],"lastName":"Tzyh-Jong Tarn","id":"37086973490"},{"name":"P.

However, the noise reduction algorithm should still be robust, i.e., insensitive to small signal model errors. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of the Generalized Sidelobe Canceller (GSC) and a recently developed Multichannel Wiener Filtering (MWF) technique for hearing aid applications both analytically and experimentally. The analysis reveals that robustness of the GSC is especially crucial in complicated noise scenarios and that microphone mismatch is particularly harmful to the GSC, even when the adaptive noise canceller is adapted during noise only. Hence, a constraint on the noise sensitivity of the GSC is essential, at the expense of less noise reduction. The MWF on the other hand, is not affected by microphone mismatch and has a potential benefit over the robust GSC with noise sensitivity constraint. However, the MWF is sensitive to the estimation accuracy of the second order statistics of speech and noise so that its benefit may be lost in nonstationary noise scenarios.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSA.2005.845821","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31219","startPage":"487","endPage":"503","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/89/31219/01453592.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robustness analysis of multichannel Wiener filtering and generalized sidelobe cancellation for multimicrophone noise reduction in hearing aid applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453592/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1453592/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robustness analysis of multichannel Wiener filtering and generalized sidelobe cancellation for multimicrophone noise reduction in hearing aid applications","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8485790","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robustness analysis of multichannel Wiener filtering and generalized sidelobe cancellation for multimicrophone noise reduction in hearing aid applications","sourcePdf":"01453592.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138419S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"89","isNumber":"31219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"31219","articleId":"1453592","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1453593,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In this paper, we propose an active learning algorithm for ASR. Automatic speech recognition systems are trained using human supervision to provide transcriptions of speech utterances. The goal of Active Learning is to minimize the human supervision for training acoustic and language models and to maximize the performance given the transcribed and untranscribed data. Active learning aims at reducing the number of training examples to be labeled by automatically processing the unlabeled examples, and then selecting the most informative ones with respect to a given cost function for a human to label. In this paper we describe how to estimate the confidence score for each utterance through an on-line algorithm using the lattice output of a speech recognizer. The utterance scores are filtered through the informativeness function and an optimal subset of training samples is selected. The active learning algorithm has been applied to both batch and on-line learning scheme and we have experimented with different selective sampling algorithms. Our experiments show that by using active learning the amount of labeled data needed for a given word accuracy can be reduced by more than 60% with respect to random sampling.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453593/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","volume":"13","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8485791","htmlLink":"/document/1453593/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Active learning: theory and applications to automatic speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active learning: theory and applications to automatic speech recognition","sourcePdf":"01453593.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074795S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"89","isNumber":"31219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"31219","articleId":"1453593","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1453597,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this paper we view acoustic fast-match as a verification problem, and hence develop an efficient likelihood ratio test, similar to other verification scenarios, to perform the fast match. Various aspects of the test like the design of alternate hypothesis models and the setting of phoneme look-ahead durations and decision thresholds are studied, resulting in an efficient implementation. The proposed fast-match is tested in a large vocabulary speech recognition task and it is demonstrated that depending on the decision threshold, it leads to 20-30% improvement in speed without any loss in recognition accuracy. In addition, it significantly outperforms a similar test based on using likelihoods only, which fails, in our setting, to bring any improvement in speed-accuracy trade-off. In a larger set of experiments with varying acoustic and task conditions, similar improvements are observed for the fast-match with the same model and setting. This indicates the robustness of the proposed technique. The gains due to the proposed method are obtained within a highly efficient 2-pass search strategy and similar or even higher gains are expected in other alternative search architectures.","doi":"10.1109/TSA.2005.845809","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/89/31219/01453597.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSA.2005.845809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31219","startPage":"546","endPage":"553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new verification-based fast-match for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1453597","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new verification-based fast-match for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453597/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8485795","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1453597/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new verification-based fast-match for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition","sourcePdf":"01453597.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099057S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"89","isNumber":"31219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"31219","articleId":"1453597","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-04"},{"_id":1453603,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Song","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/89/31219/1453603/1453603-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ying Song received the B.S. degree from Southeast University, Nanjing, China (formerly Nanjing Institute of Technology) and the M.S. degree from the Secondary Academic of Astronautics Ministry, Beijing, China, in 1985 and 1988, respectively, both in electrical engineering.","From 1988 to 1993, she was with Beijing Institute of Radio Measurement, specializing in the real-time application, firmware design and development of signal processing system used in radar and communications.

The digital ANC systems with the filtered-x least-mean-square (FXLMS) algorithm require accurate estimation of the secondary path for the stability and convergence of the algorithm. This demands a great challenge for the ANC headset design because the secondary path may fluctuate dramatically such as when the user adjusts the position of the ear-cup. In this paper, we analytically show that adding an analog feedback loop into the digital ANC systems can effectively reduce the plant fluctuation, thus achieving a more robust system. The method for designing the analog controller is highlighted. A practical hybrid analog/digital feedback ANC headset has been built and used to conduct experiments, and the experimental results show that the hybrid headset system is more robust under large plant fluctuation, and has achieved satisfactory noise cancellation for both narrowband and broadband noises.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453603/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","publicationDate":"July 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1453603/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","accessionNumber":"8485801","volume":"13","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A robust hybrid feedback active noise cancellation headset","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust hybrid feedback active noise cancellation headset","sourcePdf":"01453603.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068087S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"89","isNumber":"31219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"31219","articleId":"1453603","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1453620,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangfei Chen","affiliation":["Broadband Optical Network Research Laboratories, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Microwave Photonics Research Laboratory, School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Xiangfei Chen","id":"37278212100"},{"name":"Jianping Yao","affiliation":["Microwave Photonics Research Laboratory, School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Jianping Yao","id":"37280659900"},{"name":"Fei Zeng","affiliation":["Microwave Photonics Research Laboratory, School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Fei Zeng","id":"37292360200"},{"name":"Zhichao Deng","affiliation":["Microwave Photonics Research Laboratory, School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Zhichao Deng","id":"37271509600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"1453620","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":84,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":835},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fiber lasers","Ring lasers","Erbium-doped fiber lasers","Laser modes","Fiber gratings","Bragg gratings","Distributed feedback devices","Optical fiber sensors","Laser feedback","Masers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["laser modes","fibre lasers","ring lasers","laser cavity resonators","Bragg gratings","band-pass filters","optical fibre filters","laser accessories","laser stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-longitudinal-mode laser","fiber laser","ring laser","equivalent phase-shifted grating","fiber Bragg grating","ultranarrow filter","bandpass filter","laser cavity","ultranarrow transmission bandwidth","SLM lasing","stable SLM operation","mode hopping"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Equivalent phase shift (EPS)","fiber Bragg grating (FBG)","fiber ring laser","single longitudinal mode (SLM)"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-longitudinal-mode fiber ring laser employing an equivalent phase-shifted fiber Bragg grating","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2005.848408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31220","endPage":"1392","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/31220/01453620.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2005.848408","startPage":"1390","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1453620","abstract":"A novel single-longitudinal-mode (SLM) fiber ring laser that incorporates an equivalent phase-shifted fiber Bragg grating acting as an ultra-narrow bandpass filter in the laser cavity is proposed.

It is demonstrated that the DP topology shows much improved gain performance compared to the SP configuration although the noise figure is slightly degraded by counterpropagating amplified spontaneous emission.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453623/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1453623/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8484255","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"All silica S-band double-pass erbium-doped fiber amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"All silica S-band double-pass erbium-doped fiber amplifier","sourcePdf":"01453623.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040709S","chronDate":"July  2005","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"31220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"31220","articleId":"1453623","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":1453630,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Lu","affiliation":["Department of Physics, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Tao Lu","id":"37087148744"},{"name":"D.

Due to the different guiding mechanisms, TM and TE light have strikingly different beat lengths, which is utilized to separate the two polarizations in a directional coupler no longer than 24.2 \u03bcm.

In this letter, we demonstrate an optical-gain-clamped erbium-doped waveguide amplifier using fiber Bragg grating filters. We show both theoretically and experimentally that it is virtually insensitive to signal transient and that it reduces overshoot by 10 dB compared to standard erbium-doped fiber amplifiers. The device modeling shows that short highly doped optical amplifiers are insensitive to input signal level transient and will outperform longer fiber-based identical operating condition amplifiers. In fact, erbium-doped waveguide optical amplifiers do not exhibit any transient dynamic effect that can be detrimental after accumulation along the amplifier chain. In addition, waveguide amplifiers will require less extra pump to stabilize optical clamping, thus reducing clamping implementation cost.","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2005.848551","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/31220/01453646.pdf","startPage":"1468","endPage":"1470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2005.848551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31220","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1453646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Erbium-doped waveguide amplifier for reconfigurable WDM metro networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Erbium-doped waveguide amplifier for reconfigurable WDM metro networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453646/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2005","volume":"17","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1453646/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8484278","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Erbium-doped waveguide amplifier for reconfigurable WDM metro networks","sourcePdf":"01453646.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038977S","chronDate":"July  2005","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"31220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"31220","articleId":"1453646","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-21"},{"_id":1453660,"authors":[{"name":"M.

More autonomy in robots means that the human managing the robot may have available free time. It is desirable to use this free time productively, and a current trend is to use this available free time to manage multiple robots. We present the notion of neglect tolerance as a means for determining how robot autonomy and interface design determine how free time can be used to support multitasking, in general, and multirobot teams, in particular. We use neglect tolerance to 1) identify the maximum number of robots that can be managed; 2) identify feasible configurations of multirobot teams; and 3) predict performance of multirobot teams under certain independence assumptions. We present a measurement methodology, based on a secondary task paradigm, for obtaining neglect tolerance values that allow a human to balance workload with robot performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453692/","volume":"35","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1453692/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8480066","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2005","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Validating human-robot interaction schemes in multitasking environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Validating human-robot interaction schemes in multitasking environments","sourcePdf":"01453692.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083085S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"31221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"31221","articleId":"1453692","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1453694,"authors":[{"name":"J.G.

By assessing human workload and error together with overall performance, these experiments provide an objective means to contrast different modes of robot autonomy and to evaluate both the usability of the interface and the effectiveness of autonomous robot behavior. The first experiment compares the performance achieved when the robot takes initiative to support human driving with the opposite case when the human takes initiative to support autonomous robot driving. The utility of robot autonomy is shown through achievement of better performance when the robot is in the driver's seat. The second experiment introduces a virtual three-dimensional (3-D) map representation that supports collaborative understanding of the task and environment. When used in place of video, the 3-D map reduced operator workload and navigational error. By lowering bandwidth requirements, use of the virtual 3-D interface enables long-range, nonline-of-sight communication. Results from the third experiment extend the findings of experiment 1 by showing that collaborative control can increase performance and reduce error even when the complexity of the environment is increased and workload is distributed amongst multiple operators.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2005.850599","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/31221/01453697.pdf","startPage":"494","endPage":"504","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2005.850599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shared understanding for collaborative control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453697/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Shared understanding for collaborative control","volume":"35","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8480071","htmlLink":"/document/1453697/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shared understanding for collaborative control","sourcePdf":"01453697.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126682S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"31221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"31221","articleId":"1453697","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1453700,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Experimental results demonstrate that humans try to maintain dynamic properties of an overall system as constant as possible by adjusting their own impedance properties. Then, a new training system using a neural network for operating a human-robotic system is constructed on the basis of the experimental findings in the human tracking control properties.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Impedance","System testing","Neural networks","Power system modeling","Human robot interaction","Performance evaluation","Robot control","Senior citizens","Hospitals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["man-machine systems","computer based training","user interfaces","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","mechanical variables control","service robots","dynamics","patient rehabilitation","handicapped aids","medical robotics","orthotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tracking control properties","human-robotic system","impedance control","human robot interaction","training system","neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Human\u2013robotic systems","impedance control","man\u2013machine systems","neural network (NN)","tracking test","training system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1453700","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2005.850603","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/31221/01453700.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2005.850603","startPage":"523","endPage":"535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31221","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking control properties of human-robotic systems based on impedance control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tracking control properties of human-robotic systems based on impedance control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453700/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","volume":"35","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1453700/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8480074","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking control properties of human-robotic systems based on impedance control","sourcePdf":"01453700.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115926S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"31221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"31221","articleId":"1453700","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":1453725,"authors":[{"name":"Qin Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Integrated Optoelectronics, Institute of Semiconductors, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Qin Chen was born in Hubei Province, China, in 1979.

Using optical inputs to the electronic switching chip, single-channel routing of data through the system at the design rate of 250 Mb/s (without internal fan-out) was achieved. With 4000 optical inputs, this corresponds to a potential aggregate data input of a terabit per second into the single 14.6 /spl times/ 15.6 mm CMOS chip. In addition 50-Mb/s data rates were switched utilizing the full internal optical fan-out included in the system to complete the required connectivity. This simultaneous input of data across the chip corresponds to an aggregate data input of 0.2 Tb/s.

While the particle filter is fairly easy to implement and tune, its main drawback is that it is quite computer intensive, with the computational complexity increasing quickly with the state dimension. One remedy to this problem is to marginalize out the states appearing linearly in the dynamics. The result is that one Kalman filter is associated with each particle. The main contribution in this paper is the derivation of the details for the marginalized particle filter for a general nonlinear state-space model. Several important special cases occurring in typical signal processing applications will also be discussed. The marginalized particle filter is applied to an integrated navigation system for aircraft. It is demonstrated that the complete high-dimensional system can be based on a particle filter using marginalization for all but three states.

In the downlink, ideal \"dirty paper\" precoding is assumed. The design goal is to minimize the total transmit power while maintaining individual SINR constraints. In the uplink, the optimization problem is solved by a recursive formula with low computational complexity. The downlink problem is solved by exploiting the duality between uplink and downlink; thus, the uplink solution carries over to the downlink. In the second part of the paper, we show how the solution can be applied to the problem of rate balancing in Gaussian multiuser channels. We propose a strategy for throughput-wise optimal transmission for broadcast and multiple access channels under a sum power constraint. Finally, we show that single-user transmission achieves the sum capacity in the low-SNR regime.

The case of the ergodic throughput for Gaussian distributed input signals is analyzed, and the conditions for the (asymptotical) achievement of the Shannon capacity are pointed out. The main contributions of this work may be so summarized. First, we develop closed-form analytical expressions for the computation of the ergodic information throughput conveyed by the considered MIMO system for the case of ideal feedback link. Second, we present an iterative algorithm for the optimized power allocation over the transmit antennas that explicitly accounts for the imperfect MIMO channel estimates available at the receiver. Third, after relaxing the assumption of ideal feedback link, we test the sensitivity of the proposed power allocation algorithm on errors possibly introduced by the feedback channel, and then, we numerically evaluate the resulting throughput loss. Finally, we develop closed-form upper and lower bounds on the outage probability that are asymptotically tight.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/31224/01453767.pdf","startPage":"2335","endPage":"2347","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.849165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.849165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31224","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1453767","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the information throughput and optimized power allocation for MIMO wireless systems with imperfect channel estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","MIMO","Channel estimation","Feedback","Iterative algorithms","Constraint optimization","Transmitters","Signal analysis","Information analysis","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","MIMO systems","channel estimation","feedback","radio receivers","Gaussian channels","iterative methods","radio links","transmitting antennas","probability","antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information throughput","power allocation optimization","MIMO wireless system","imperfect channel estimation","multiple-input multiple-output","pilot-based wireless system","feedback-path","Gaussian distributed input signal","transmit antenna","radio receiver","outage probability","antenna array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ergodic throughput","imperfect channel estimation","MIMO systems","multiple antennas","outage probability","power allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"On the information throughput and optimized power allocation for MIMO wireless systems with imperfect channel estimation","volume":"53","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/1453767/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8485225","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the information throughput and optimized power allocation for MIMO wireless systems with imperfect channel estimation","sourcePdf":"01453767.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101554S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"31224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"31224","articleId":"1453767","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":1453768,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

Although higher order spectra are a set of well-known time-shift invariant features, direct use of them (except for power spectrum) is impractical due to their complexity. A method for calculating the Euclidean distance in higher order spectra feature space is proposed in this paper, which avoids calculating the higher order spectra, effectively reducing the computation complexity and storage requirement. Moreover, according to the widely used scattering center model, theoretical analysis and experimental results in this paper show that the feature vector extracted from the average profile in a small target-aspect sector has better generalization performance than the average feature vector in the same sector when both of them are used as feature templates in HRRP-based RATR. The proposed Euclidean distance calculation method and average profile-based template database are applied to two classification algorithms [the template matching method (TMM) and the radial basis function network (RBFN)] to evaluate the recognition performances of higher order spectra features. Experimental results for measured data show that the power spectrum has the best recognition performance among higher order spectra.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radar HRRP target recognition based on higher order spectra","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.849161","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/31224/01453769.pdf","startPage":"2359","endPage":"2368","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.849161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31224","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1453769","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453769/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Radar HRRP target recognition based on higher order spectra","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"53","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/1453769/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8485227","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radar HRRP target recognition based on higher order spectra","sourcePdf":"01453769.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07696S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"31224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"142","xplore-issue":"31224","articleId":"1453769","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":1453770,"authors":[{"name":"Rensheng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/31224/1453770/1453770-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rensheng Wang (S'03) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 1995 and 1997, respectively, both in electrical engineering.

Two decorrelating code-timing estimation schemes, namely the frequency-domain least-squares (FLS) and frequency-domain weighted least-squares (FWLS) estimators, are developed. The two proposed estimators offer different tradeoffs between complexity and estimation accuracy. A critical step for decorrelating-based estimation is to decompose the received signal into subsignals of shorter duration. We discuss how to perform the decomposition to ensure improved identifiability and statistical stability of the proposed schemes. Due to a unique signal structure in the frequency domain, both the FLS and FWLS estimators admit efficient implementations that result in significant complexity reductions. The Crame/spl acute/r-Rao bound for the estimation problem under study is derived and used as an assessment tool for the proposed estimators. Numerical results show that both of the proposed estimators can support overloaded systems (with more users than the processing gain) in multipath fading environments and significantly outperform a conventional technique based on matched-filter processing.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.849177","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/31224/01453770.pdf","startPage":"2369","endPage":"2381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.849177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decorrelating multiuser code-timing estimation for long-code CDMA with bandlimited chip waveforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1453770","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453770/","displayDocTitle":"Decorrelating multiuser code-timing estimation for long-code CDMA with bandlimited chip waveforms","volume":"53","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8485228","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1453770/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decorrelating multiuser code-timing estimation for long-code CDMA with bandlimited chip waveforms","sourcePdf":"01453770.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094643S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"31224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"31224","articleId":"1453770","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1453771,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This paper presents an analysis of convergence of the class of Sequential Partial Update LMS algorithms (S-LMS) under various assumptions and shows that divergence can be prevented by scheduling coefficient updates at random, which we call the Stochastic Partial Update LMS algorithm (SPU-LMS). Specifically, under the standard independence assumptions, for wide sense stationary signals, the S-LMS algorithm converges in the mean if the step-size parameter /spl mu/ is in the convergent range of ordinary LMS. Relaxing the independence assumption, it is shown that S-LMS and LMS algorithms have the same sufficient conditions for exponential stability. However, there exist nonstationary signals for which the existing algorithms, S-LMS included, are unstable and do not converge for any value of /spl mu/. On the other hand, under broad conditions, the SPU-LMS algorithm remains stable for nonstationary signals. Expressions for convergence rate and steady-state mean-square error of SPU-LMS are derived. The theoretical results of this paper are validated and compared by simulation through numerical examples.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.849167","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/31224/01453771.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.849167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31224","startPage":"2382","endPage":"2399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial update LMS algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1453771","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Partial update LMS algorithms","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453771/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8485229","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1453771/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial update LMS algorithms","sourcePdf":"01453771.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108403S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"31224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"31224","articleId":"1453771","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1453772,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Gong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Queen''s University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/31224/1453772/1453772-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu Gong received the B.Sc. and M.Eng. degrees from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 1992 and 1995, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the National University of Singapore in 2000, all in electrical and electronic engineering.","From 2000 to 2002, he was a research engineer, and later a senior engineer, with the Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore.

Among existing algorithms that can be found in the literature, two of which, namely the segmented filter (SF) and gradient descent (GD) algorithms, are of particular interest as they can search for the optimum tap-length quickly. In this paper, at first, we carefully compare the SF and GD algorithms and show that the two algorithms are equivalent in performance under some constraints, but each has advantages/disadvantages relative to the other. Then, we propose an improved variable tap-length algorithm using the concept of the pseudo fractional tap-length (FT). Updating the tap-length with instantaneous errors in a style similar to that used in the stochastic gradient [or least mean squares (LMS)] algorithm, the proposed FT algorithm not only retains the advantages from both the SF and the GD algorithms but also has significantly less complexity than existing algorithms. Both performance analysis and numerical simulations are given to verify the new proposed algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453772/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"53","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2005","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","accessionNumber":"8485230","htmlLink":"/document/1453772/","displayDocTitle":"An LMS style variable tap-length algorithm for structure adaptation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An LMS style variable tap-length algorithm for structure adaptation","sourcePdf":"01453772.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062621S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"31224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"31224","articleId":"1453772","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1453775,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The proposed algorithms improve the scalability of the filter architectures affected by the resampling process. Problems in the particle filter implementation due to resampling are described, and appropriate modifications of the resampling algorithms are proposed so that distributed implementations are developed and studied. Distributed resampling algorithms with proportional allocation (RPA) and nonproportional allocation (RNA) of particles are considered. The components of the filter architectures are the processing elements (PEs), a central unit (CU), and an interconnection network. One of the main advantages of the new resampling algorithms is that communication through the interconnection network is reduced and made deterministic, which results in simpler network structure and increased sampling frequency. Particle filter performances are estimated for the bearings-only tracking applications. In the architectural part of the analysis, the area and speed of the particle filter implementation are estimated for a different number of particles and a different level of parallelism with field programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation. In this paper, only sampling importance resampling (SIR) particle filters are considered, but the analysis can be extended to any particle filters with resampling.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resampling algorithms and architectures for distributed particle filters","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.849185","startPage":"2442","endPage":"2450","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.849185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31224","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/31224/01453776.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1453776","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453776/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Resampling algorithms and architectures for distributed particle filters","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"53","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/1453776/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8485234","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resampling algorithms and architectures for distributed particle filters","sourcePdf":"01453776.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049336S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"31224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"201","xplore-issue":"31007","articleId":"1453776","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":1453779,"authors":[{"name":"M.S.

The single measurement sparse solution problem has been extensively studied in the past. Although known to be NP-hard, many single-measurement suboptimal algorithms have been formulated that have found utility in many different applications. Here, we consider in depth the extension of two classes of algorithms-Matching Pursuit (MP) and FOCal Underdetermined System Solver (FOCUSS)-to the multiple measurement case so that they may be used in applications such as neuromagnetic imaging, where multiple measurement vectors are available, and solutions with a common sparsity structure must be computed. Cost functions appropriate to the multiple measurement problem are developed, and algorithms are derived based on their minimization. A simulation study is conducted on a test-case dictionary to show how the utilization of more than one measurement vector improves the performance of the MP and FOCUSS classes of algorithm, and their performances are compared.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453780/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","volume":"53","issue":"7","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8485238","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","publicationDate":"July 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1453780/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Sparse solutions to linear inverse problems with multiple measurement vectors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse solutions to linear inverse problems with multiple measurement vectors","sourcePdf":"01453780.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13704S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"31224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"925","xplore-issue":"31224","articleId":"1453780","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1453781,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

The concept proposed in this paper is a natural unification of methods, known from flat fading MIMO channels and frequency selective single-input single-output (SISO) channels. From the Kronecker canonical form of the channel equation, several subchannels can be identified. Each of them is related to an elementary divisor or minimal index of the channel. The elementary divisors are equivalent to the roots of the characteristic polynomial for SISO channels, whereas the minimal indices characterize the possible transmit or receive diversity in such channels. The knowledge of these values allows us to determine the necessary filter order, the minimal redundancy, and the conditions on the precoder such that a finite impulse response filter can suppress all intersymbol and interchannel interference completely.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The algebraic structure of frequency-selective MIMO channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.849194","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/31224/01453782.pdf","startPage":"2498","endPage":"2512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.849194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31224","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1453782","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453782/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","displayDocTitle":"The algebraic structure of frequency-selective MIMO channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"53","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/1453782/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8485240","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The algebraic structure of frequency-selective MIMO channels","sourcePdf":"01453782.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.344584S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"31224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"31224","articleId":"1453782","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1453783,"authors":[{"name":"A.T.

The proposed method is an iterative algorithm called SubGradient based Blind Algorithm (SGBA) for both real and complex constellations, with a very simple update rule. It is based on the minimization of the l/sub /spl infin// norm of the equalizer output under a linear constraint on the equalizer coefficients using subgradient iterations. The algorithm has a nice convergence behavior attributed to the convex l/sub /spl infin// cost surface as well as the step size selection rules associated with the subgradient search. We illustrate the performance of the algorithm using examples with both complex and real constellations, where we show that the proposed algorithm's convergence is less sensitive to initial point selection, and a fast convergence behavior can be achieved with a judicious selection of step sizes. Furthermore, the amount of data required for the training of the equalizer is significantly lower than most of the existing schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/31224/01453783.pdf","startPage":"2513","endPage":"2524","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.849195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.849195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31224","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1453783","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast and low complexity blind equalization via subgradient projections","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind equalizers","Convergence","Iterative algorithms","Cost function","Signal processing algorithms","Iterative methods","Bandwidth","Training data","Statistics","Engineering profession"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","equalisers","iterative methods","convergence of numerical methods","optimisation","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","iterative blind equalization method","constant modulus algorithm","convergence","nonconvex cost function","subgradient iteration","convex optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind equalization","convex optimization","subgradient"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453783/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Fast and low complexity blind equalization via subgradient projections","volume":"53","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/1453783/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8485241","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and low complexity blind equalization via subgradient projections","sourcePdf":"01453783.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12742S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"31224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"31224","articleId":"1453783","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1453784,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The effects of interframe interference and multiple-access interference on the performance of a generic Rake receiver are investigated for asynchronous systems in frequency-selective environments. A key step is to model the asynchronous system as a chip-synchronous system with uniformly distributed timing jitter for the transmitted pulses of interfering users. This model allows the analytical technique developed for the synchronous case to be extended to the asynchronous case and allows the derivation of closed-form equations for the bit error probability in various Rake receiver architectures. It is shown that a Gaussian approximation can be used for both multiple-access and interframe interference as long as the number of frames per symbols is large (typically, at least 5), whereas there is no minimum requirement for the number of users for the equations to hold. It is observed that under many circumstances, the chip-synchronous case shows a worse bit error probability performance than the asynchronous case; the amount of the difference depends on the autocorrelation function of the ultra-wideband pulse and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio of the system. Simulations studies support the approximate analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.849197","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/31224/01453785.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.849197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31224","startPage":"2537","endPage":"2549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of impulse radio UWB systems with pulse-based polarity randomization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1453785","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of impulse radio UWB systems with pulse-based polarity randomization","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1453785/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8485243","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1453785/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of impulse radio UWB systems with pulse-based polarity randomization","sourcePdf":"01453785.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10106S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"31224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"31224","articleId":"1453785","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1453788,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

In many practical applications, impulsive measurement noise severely weakens the effectiveness of conventional methods. In this paper, /spl alpha/-stable noise is used as a noise model. In such case, the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion is no longer an appropriate metric for estimation error due to the lack of finite second-order statistics of the noise. Therefore, we adopt minimum dispersion criterion, which in turn leads to the adaptive least mean pth power (LMP) algorithm. It is shown that the LMP algorithm under the /spl alpha/-stable noise model converges as long as the step size satisfies certain conditions. The effect of p on the performance is also investigated.

While existing simulation tools allow designers to compute resonant frequencies, few tools provide estimates of the damping in these devices. This paper reports on a new tool that allows designers, for the first time, to compute anchor losses in high-frequency resonators and account for sub-surface scatterers. By exercising the tool on a family of radially driven disk resonators, we show that the anchor loss mechanism for this class of devices involves a parasitic mixed-mode bending action that pumps energy into the substrate. Further, using the tool, we predict a large variation in resonator quality depending upon film thickness. Our simulation shows that the source of this variation is a complex radial-to-bending motion interaction, which we visualize with a root-locus diagram. We experimentally verify this predicted sensitivity using poly-SiGe disk resonators having Q's ranging from 200 to 54,000.","doi":"10.1109/MEMSYS.2005.1453885","publicationTitle":"18th IEEE International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems, 2005.

Tests were performed on a 50-100 /spl mu/m-thick layer of water containing 3 /spl mu/m polystyrene beads for flow visualization. The thermal source is a polyimide cantilever with an integrated heater near the tip, operated with input powers ranging from 0-32 mW. It has no moving parts and does not contact the liquid. The speed of the doublet flow scales with input power as well as liquid temperature, and is inversely related to the air gap between the heater and liquid surface. The orientation of the doublet flow can be reversed by changing the angle of the cantilever. A one-dimensional array of probes used in the same manner generates a linear flow pattern.","doi":"10.1109/MEMSYS.2005.1454017","publicationTitle":"18th IEEE International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems, 2005.

Microliter-sized droplets of TNT are programmed to transport, mix, and react with potassium hydroxide (KOH) on the microfluidic chip. Colorimetric reactions of TNT are characterized both on a spectrophotometer and on the microfluidic chip. The detection of TNT on the chip is linear in the range of 4-20 /spl mu/g/mL with a time-to-result of 2.5 minutes. It is also observed that the absorbance peaks of DNT (dinitrotoluene) and TNT are mutually independent and that the presence of DNT does not affect the detection of TNT. Electrowetting also does not seem to influence the colorimetric complex as observed from a comparison of results between a spectrophotometer and on-chip.","doi":"10.1109/MEMSYS.2005.1454031","publicationTitle":"18th IEEE International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems, 2005.

This technique is extremely computationally expensive due to (1) the number of iterations required to search through the large parameter space and (2) the heavy computational load needed for determining the cost function (the distance between two surfaces). This is the main obstacle in pushing surface based registration for image guided surgery, where near real time registration is needed. Most attempts to reduce the computational burden, e.g., gradient descent and ICP, have been targeted at reducing the number of iterations for the optimization. In this paper, we propose to use a neural network to model the surface of the reference structure. This not only provides an accurate model for the surface but also a fast method for computing the cost function. For CT-CT spine registration, the time taken to register two spine surfaces is about 10 times faster compared to the commonly used triangular mesh modeling with similar registration accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/BIOCAS.2004.1454111","startPage":"S3/2","endPage":"17","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Workshop on Biomedical Circuits and Systems, 2004.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9867/31226/01454111.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Workshop on Biomedical Circuits and Systems, 2004.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIOCAS.2004.1454111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network approach for 3D surface modeling and registration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Computed tomography","Surgery","Cost function","Bones","Image segmentation","Biological tissues","Biomedical engineering","Mechanical engineering","Registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bone","computerised tomography","medical image processing","neural nets","image registration","surgery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","3D surface modeling","surface based registration","image aided surgery","gradient descent","ICP","iterations","CT-CT spine registration","triangular mesh modeling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1454111/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec. 2004","displayDocTitle":"A neural network approach for 3D surface modeling and registration","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1454111/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 2004","accessionNumber":"8446183","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network approach for 3D surface modeling and registration","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"01454111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052707S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9867","isNumber":"31226","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9867","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"31226","articleId":"1454111","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1454112,"authors":[{"name":"F.H.

This paper presents a new image compression method with high fidelity in digital colorful image sensors with Bayer color filter arrays (CFAs). The captured CFA data is first smoothed by two low-pass filters which can be reconstructed perfectly, and then the filtered data are being compressed directly without full color interpolation. Assuring high image quality, the method can provide lower compression ratio (bit/pixel) and lower complexity than any conventional interpolation-first methods and other existing similar compression-first methods. Moreover, by adjusting the quality control factor, the image quality, PSNR9 can be changed from 46.37dB to infinity with the average compression ratio varying from 3.5bits/pixel to 6.9bits/pixeL In addition, the method provides lossless compression for the region of interest (ROI).","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Workshop on Biomedical Circuits and Systems,

The fetal heart is very small and thus the electrical current it generates is much lower than that of the mother. In order to extract the fetal ECG for proper clinical diagnostic, some adaptive filtering technique can be used to remove or suppress the maternal ECG. Often, a number of electrodes are placed around the general area of the fetus to pick up multiple FECG signals. In this case, blind source separation (BSS) algorithm can be used to separate the FECG from the MECG effectively. Blind source separation of independent sources from their mixtures is a common problem in many real world multi-sensor applications. However, the algorithm requires high computation and thus a real-time implementation using software is not practical, or expensive. In this paper, we propose and implement an efficient and low-cost FPGA (field programmable gate array) hardware architecture for the realization of a real-time BSS in the application of FECG signal separation. The FPGA design implements the modified Torkkola's BSS algorithm for audio signals based on ICA (independent component analysis) technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of FPGA hardware for a real-time blind source separation of fetal ECG signals","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Workshop on Biomedical Circuits and Systems, 2004.","doi":"10.1109/BIOCAS.2004.1454135","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Workshop on Biomedical Circuits and Systems, 2004.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9867/31226/01454135.pdf","startPage":"S2/4","endPage":"13","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIOCAS.2004.1454135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31226","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1454135","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1454135/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Design of FPGA hardware for a real-time blind source separation of fetal ECG signals","conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1454135/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8446206","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of FPGA hardware for a real-time blind source separation of fetal ECG signals","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"01454135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037835S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9867","isNumber":"31226","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9867","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"31226","articleId":"1454135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1454146,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The amplitude of the P300 evoked potential is inversely proportional to the probability of infrequent or task-related stimulus. In existing P300 spellers, rows and columns of a matrix are intensified successively and randomly, resulting in a stimulus frequency of 1/N (N is the number of rows or columns of the matrix). We propose a new paradigm to display each single character randomly and individually (therefore reducing the stimulus frequency to 1/(N*N)). On-line experiments showed that this new speller significantly improved the performance. Specifically, the new speller can reduce character classification error rate by up to 80% or double the information transfer rate compared to the existing P300 spellers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High performance P300 speller for brain-computer interface","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Workshop on Biomedical Circuits and Systems, 2004.","doi":"10.1109/BIOCAS.2004.1454155","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Workshop on Biomedical Circuits and Systems, 2004.","pdfPath":"/iel5/9867/31226/01454155.pdf","startPage":"S3/5/INV","endPage":"S3/13","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIOCAS.2004.1454155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31226","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1454155","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1454155/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec. 2004","displayDocTitle":"High performance P300 speller for brain-computer interface","conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1454155/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8446226","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High performance P300 speller for brain-computer interface","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"01454155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059511S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"9867","isNumber":"31226","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9867","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"31226","articleId":"1454155","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1454161,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Wei","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Yu Wei","id":"37423617700"},{"name":"Xiong Bing","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Xiong Bing","id":"37429847800"},{"name":"C.

However, in the cases of high-resolution image and real-time video, the algorithm still poses a high computation load that could not be met by average personal computers. In this paper, FPGA (field programmable gate array) design of hardware for a real-time face detection based on AdaBoost algorithm is described.

From the simulation results, the open-tip antenna had a small amount of magnetic field distribution at the tip, while the dielectric-tip antenna had virtually no magnetic field distribution at the tip. The metal-tip and slot antennas had continuous magnetic field distribution extending from the tip.

These systems are unconventional in the sense that while they behave like resistive devices, they can be endowed with a rather exotic variety of dynamic characteristics. While possessing memory and exhibiting small-signal inductive or capacitive effects, they are incapable of energy discharge and they introduce no phase shift between the input and output waveforms. This zero-crossing property gives rise to a Lissajous figure which always passes through the origin. Memristive systems are hysteretic in the sense that their Lissajous figures vary with the excitation frequency. At very low frequencies, memristive systems are indistinguishable from nonlinear resistors while at extremely high frequencies, they reduce to linear resistors. These anomalous properties have misled and prevented the identification of many memristive devices and systems-including the thermistor, the Hodgkin-Huxley membrane circuit model, and the discharge tubes. Generic properties of memristive systems are derived and a canonic dynamical system model is presented along with an explicit algorithm for identifying the model parameters and functions.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1976.10092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1976.10092","startPage":"209","endPage":"223","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31238/01454361.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memristive devices and systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1454361/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1976","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1976","displayDocTitle":"Memristive devices and systems","volume":"64","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"Feb. 1976","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memristive devices and systems","sourcePdf":"01454361.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042663S","chronDate":"Feb.  1976","isNumber":"31238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"1512","articleId":"1454361","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":1454364,"authors":[{"name":"W.F.

The principal reason for the interest is their ability to automatically steer nulls onto undesired sources of interference, thereby reducing output noise and enhancing the detection of desired signals. These systems usually consist of an array of antenna elements and a real-time adaptive receiver-processor which has feedback control over the element weights. This paper provides a tutorial introduction to adaptive arrays from the viewpoint of antenna beam-forming and null steering. The particular vehicle chosen for discussion is the Howells-Applebaum analog servo-control-loop processor. This processor derives feedback control error signals from the correlations between element signals, i.e., on the basis of the covariance matrix of the set of system inputs. A simple two-element array with a single adaptive control loop is addressed first, in order to set the stage for analysis of a basic K-element linear array with K adaptive control loops. The set of linear differential equations associated with the controlloop network can be solved by a Q-matrix transformation into orthonormal eigenvector space. The purely mathematical Q-matrix is interpreted in terms of orthogonal beam-forming networks, similar in principle to a Butler matrix beam-forming network. The Q-matrix network produces a set of K orthogonal normalized eigenvector beams whose output powers are proportional to the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. These beams are utilized in a convenient expression for calculating the time-dependent output pattern function for the array. Performance characteristics have been calculated for different distributions of interference sources to demonstrate the effects of power level, source location with respect to the quiescent beam pattern, source spacing in terms of array resolution, source bandwidth, continuous source distributions, and the array \"degrees of freedom\" captured. Two modifications of the basic system are also included: the addition of a hard-limiter in the control loops, and a change in the antenna aperture element arrangement to a circular array with an omni \"mainbeam.\"","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1976","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1976","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1454364/","volume":"64","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1976","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive arrays\u2014An introduction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive arrays\u2014An introduction","sourcePdf":"01454364.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040146S","chronDate":"Feb.  1976","isNumber":"31238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"181","articleId":"1454364","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1454380,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Specific results are presented for a rotating circular cylinder immersed in a plane wave of the E or H type. Particular emphasis is put on the low-frequency limit, but some numerical data are also given for a typical frequency in the \"resonance\" region. The analysis becomes more complicated in the absence of symmetry of revolution. It is then necessary to solve the problem in a rotating system of coordinates. Maxwell's equations are written in these coordinates, together with the relevant constitutive equations and boundary conditions. The general formalism is applied to a typical two-dimensional configuration, viz., a cylinder immersed in an incident E wave. Considerable simplification obtains if all material velocities are negligible with respect to c, a condition which is always met in practice. Even simpler results are obtained if the cross-sectional dimensions of the cylinder are small with respect to \u03bb. Some numerical results are presented, at low frequencies, for a dielectric cylinder of rectangular cross section.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1976","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1976","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1454380/","volume":"64","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1976","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Electromagnetic fields in the presence of rotating bodies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electromagnetic fields in the presence of rotating bodies","sourcePdf":"01454380.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042865S","chronDate":"March  1976","isNumber":"31239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"134","articleId":"1454380","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1454408,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The major advantages of the filters are their small size, high reliability, low cost, high Q, good reproducibility, temperature stability, wide dynamic range, and linear phase response, as well as special characteristics relevant to specific applications. Surface-acousticwave (SAW) devices are used for bandpass filtering [1], matched filtering for radar pulse compression [2], [3] or spread-spectrum signal processing [4], delay lines [5], and frequency control elements [3], [6].

Major technological advances discussed include unidirectional SAW filters [7] which eliminate bidirectionality loss and simultaneously suppress in-band spurious responses to achieve an insertion loss below 1 dB with a 0.04-dB peak-to-peak ripple. A novel surface-wave sub-system [8] which offers revolutionary signal processing functions through transform processing is also described.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1976.10190","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31241/01454459.pdf","startPage":"652","endPage":"671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1976.10190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Surface-acoustic-wave devices for communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1454459/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1976","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1976","displayDocTitle":"Surface-acoustic-wave devices for communications","volume":"64","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1976","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Surface-acoustic-wave devices for communications","sourcePdf":"01454459.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0709S","chronDate":"May  1976","isNumber":"31241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"69","articleId":"1454459","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1454465,"authors":[{"name":"K.R.

In this paper, we describe design and performance details of a prototype convolver which processes signals of 10-\u00b5s duration with a 100-MHz bandwidth. A dynamic range of 50 dB is obtained, and error signals are 30 dB below the output signal with input signal levels of +14 dBm.

For stationary stochastic inputs, the mean-square error, the difference between the filter output and an externally supplied input called the \"desired response,\" is a quadratic function of the weights, a paraboloid with a single fixed minimum point that can be sought by gradient techniques. The gradient estimation process is shown to introduce noise into the weight vector that is proportional to the speed of adaptation and number of weights. The effect of this noise is expressed in terms of a dimensionless quantity \"misadjustment\" that is a measure of the deviation from optimal Wiener performance. Analysis of a simple nonstationary case, in which the minimum point of the error surface is moving according to an assumed first-order Markov process, shows that an additional contribution to misadjustment arises from \"lag\" of the adaptive process in tracking the moving minimum point. This contribution, which is additive, is proportional to the number of weights but inversely proportional to the speed of adaptation. The sum of the misadjustments can be minimized by choosing the speed of adaptation to make equal the two contributions. It is further shown, in Appendix A, that for stationary inputs the LMS adaptive algorithm, based on the method of steepest descent, approaches the theoretical limit of efficiency in terms of misadjustment and speed of adaptation when the eigenvalues of the input correlation matrix are equal or close in value.

Early in 1888 the Edison dc interests first launched public attacks on the technical aspects of ac. Later they redirected the controversy, from a general consideration of comparative merits, to concentrate on only the safety issue. The decision of dc interests to launch public attacks on ac was probably caused by the success of a French copper syndicate in cornering much of the world's copper supply and forcing prices sharply upward in 1887. This made the lower copper costs of ac systems an attractive selling point and forced dc proponents to react. Thus the early months of 1888 saw a number of well-rounded discussions on the comparative merits of the two systems. The decision in mid-1888 to focus the debate on the safety issue was related to the discovery, in the spring of that year, of a workable principle for an ac ampere-hour meter (Shallenberger) and an ac motor (Tesla). The Edison interests were largely successful in focusing the polemics on the safety issue and achieved several major publicity coups (such as the use of ac for the first legal electrocution), but they were unable to match the technical improvements that by 1895 were clearly to make ac a far better system of power transmission.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1976.10324","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31245/01454593.pdf","startPage":"1339","endPage":"1343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1976.10324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The damnable alternating current","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1454593/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1976","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1976","displayDocTitle":"The damnable alternating current","volume":"64","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1976","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The damnable alternating current","sourcePdf":"01454593.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036434S","chronDate":"Sept.  1976","isNumber":"31245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"10","articleId":"1454593","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1454653,"authors":[{"name":"P.L.

This paper introduces and places into perspective the role which Kolmogorov structure functions have in theory. It is demonstrated that the rms fractional frequency deviation (phase accumulation) introduced by Cutler and Searle is related to the first phase structure function; the two-sample Allan variance is related to the second phase structure function. In addition, it is shown how the two-sample Allan variance is related to the rms fractional frequency deviation under suitable conditions. The L-sample Allan variance is also identified in terms of the first phase structure function; it is shown to be an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the rms fractional frequency deviation squared if the latter existL The utility of higher order structure functions of frequency and phase in the theory of instability is also demonstrated; in particular, how the frequency drift and \"flicker\"-type noise convergence problems can be overcome.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1976","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1454677/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1976","volume":"64","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1976","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Theory of oscillator instability based upon structure functions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theory of oscillator instability based upon structure functions","sourcePdf":"01454677.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055492S","chronDate":"Dec.  1976","isNumber":"31248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"53","articleId":"1454677","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1454678,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The resulting intensity data give the product of the diffuse surface reflectance and the cosine of the angle of incidence for each picture element in the scene.

This is because the improvement of the communication quality by the increase of the transmission power is difficult in the satellite link and the regenerative repeater is very effective for removing cochannel interferences which will become predominant factor of signal degradation in the future and it will also provide great facility for various kinds of on-board processings. This paper first presents basic configurations of the on-board regenerative repeater, and discusses about simplification of the repeater. Next various kinds of on board processings ate discussed in connection with the regenerative repeating. Then a concrete regenerative repeater applied to satellite switched/TDMA (SS/TDMA) satellite system which augments the communication capacity by frequency reuse is presented and compared with the conventional frequency translating type in terms of link budget, power dissipation, and weight.

In the symmetric case, relevant terms from graph theory are defined. Band systems and matrices arising from the discretization of partial differential equations are treated as separate cases. Preordering techniques are surveyed with particular emphasis on partitioning (to block triangular form) and tearing (to bordered block triangular form). Methods for solving the least squares problem and for sparse linear programming are also reviewed. The sparse eigenproblem is discussed with particular reference to some fairly recent iterative methods. There is a short discussion of general iterative techniques, and reference is made to good standard texts in this field. Design considerations when implementing sparse matrix algorithms are examined and finally comments are made concerning the availability of codes in this area.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1454783/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1977","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1977","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"April 1977","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","volume":"65","issue":"4","displayDocTitle":"A survey of sparse matrix research","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A survey of sparse matrix research","sourcePdf":"01454783.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.278037S","chronDate":"April  1977","isNumber":"31252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"157","articleId":"1454783","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1454784,"authors":[{"name":"A.N.

In this paper we present a systematic investigation of these changes in visual sensitivity and apply it to adapt the quantizer of a predictive coder. The paper consists of three parts. In the first part, earlier psychophysical work in related areas relevant to picture coding is briefly reviewed. Certain simple measures of luminance activity (called the masking functions) are constructed. Subjective experiments which obtain fidelity measures related to the masking functions, using complex scenes (real-life pictures, head and shoulders view), are described. These relationships, called the visibility functions, express relationship between the relative amplitude accuracy required by the viewer and the masking functions. Perceptual, statistical, and contextual properties are inherent in them. Relationship between the visibility functions and some earlier measurements of psychovisual weighting functions are pointed out. In the second part, several adaptation strategies for the quantizer of a predictive DPCM coder are discussed. These include uniform as well as nonuniform quantizers with or without entropy constraints. These strategies are simulated on a computer, and the results are presented in the third part. The simulations indicate that, for the same picture quality, by using adaptive strategies, entropy reductions of about 30-50 percent are possible over nonadaptive techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1454784/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1977","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1977","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"April 1977","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","volume":"65","issue":"4","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive quantization of picture signals using spatial masking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive quantization of picture signals using spatial masking","sourcePdf":"01454784.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054415S","chronDate":"April  1977","isNumber":"31252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"130","articleId":"1454784","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1454786,"authors":[{"name":"G.S.

The selection of a prosthesis function requires a receiver to process the myoelectric signal, contaminated with noise, and to decide on the basis of the received signals which function is desired. Thus the channnel cleady presents a problem of choice of receiver and of decision strategy. Previous sotutions to this problem have been basically empirical. In this paper we seek the optimum receiver where optimum is in the minimum probability of error sense. First a model is developed for the bipolar myoelectric signal to provide information about the relevant signal parameters and statistics. Using this information the Bayes minimum probability of error receiver is derived for an orbitrary signal parameter set. The optimum signal parameter set is then found for the Bayes receiver, and the receiver performance calculated. The receiver performance is measured and compared with the calculated performance. A significant performance improvement is seen in the optimum receiver over a more conventional receiver.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1977.10545","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","startPage":"662","endPage":"674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1977.10545","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31253","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31253/01454814.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing","Prosthetics","Measurement standards","Biomedical signal processing","Signal generators","Muscles","Elbow","Error correction","Humans"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Signal processing for the multistate myoelectric channel","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1454814/","volume":"65","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"May 1977","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1977","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1977","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal processing for the multistate myoelectric channel","sourcePdf":"01454814.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033029S","chronDate":"May  1977","isNumber":"31253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"92","articleId":"1454814","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":1454819,"authors":[{"name":"M.E.

The combined workload of several hospitals could be processed by a \"regional ECG interpretation center,\" if ECG data could be conveniently and efficiently transmitted to this center. ECG transmission over the public telephone network is common practice today, using FM techniques. However, because of the limited bandwidth of the telephone network and of occasionally severe noise, the signal quality achieved is only marginally adequate for computer interpretation. Transmission of binary-coded ECG's could overcome this problem but the data rates required greatly exceed the available channel capacity of telephone lines. Digital transmission may still be possible if ECG are preprocessed in order to eliminate redundant information and thereby lower the data rate. In this paper the operational characteristics of digital ECG communication are discussed in the context of computer-aided interpretation. Encoding methods proposed by other authors are briefly reviewed, and finally, a prototype system based on an 8-bit microprocessor is described. This system provides real-time transmission of 3 encoded ECG leads, sampled at a rate of 300 per second per lead and digitized with a resolution of 8 bits, using a 2400-Bd synchronous MODEM on standard (unconditioned) telephone lines. Some preliminary results are shown.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1454821/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1977","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1977","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"May 1977","volume":"65","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Microprocessor application for numerical ECG encoding and transmission","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microprocessor application for numerical ECG encoding and transmission","sourcePdf":"01454821.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049168S","chronDate":"May  1977","isNumber":"31253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"24","articleId":"1454821","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1454828,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Such maps, commonly known as spectral transformations, have the important property of carrying a stable rational transfer function to another stable rational function. This paper presents a unified framework for designing 2-D stable digital filters from prescribed magnitude-response specifications using spectral transformations such that the magnitude response of the resultant approximation is sort of a \"best\" approximation of the given specification. It is shown that there are two basic strategies for such designs, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The design procedures are illustrated with practical examples. Further, it is also shown that all earlier results on 2-D filter design using spectral transformations follow as special cases of the general theory presented here.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1454857/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1977","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1977","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"65","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1977","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Design of two-dimensional digital filters via spectral transformations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of two-dimensional digital filters via spectral transformations","sourcePdf":"01454857.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058732S","chronDate":"June  1977","isNumber":"31254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"37","articleId":"1454857","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1454858,"authors":[{"name":"L.O.

Topics covered in this paper are divided into \"waves in randomly distributed scatterers,\" \"waves in random continua,\" and \"remote-sensing of random media.\" Transport theory with various approximate solutions and multiple scattering theories are discussed and their relationships are clarified. Included in the analyses are propagation characteristics of intensities, wave fluctuations, pulse propagation and scattering, coherence bandwidth, and coherence time of communication channels through random media.

A brief view of microcomputer software is then presented as an attempt to arouse the designer's awareness of application, system, and development-aid softwares. Next, economic considerations are presented for overall decision making. Finally, a minicomputer-driven microprocessor laboratory oriented to both teaching and system development purposes is described.

We start with a series of subjective tests that determine the visibility of quantization noise in several different circumstances. Specifically, two distinct functional relationships for the visibility of quantizing noise in color components are investigated: 1) its dependence on the slope of the luminance signal, 2) its dependence on the slope of the chrominance signal. Using fidelity criteria determined by these visibility functions, quantizers are optimized for the following encoding situations: 1) adaptive PCM coding of the chrominance components based on the luminance slope, 2) element DPCM coding of the individual color components, 3) adaptive DPCM coding of the chrominance components based on the luminance slope, 4) plateau coding of the chrominance components. Pictures are coded using quantizers for encoding situations 2), 3), and 4) Advantages of optimization are brought out by comparing the performance of the optimum quantizers with quantizers optimized on the basis of certain commonly used criteria or with other quantizers. In all cases, we find that for a given bit rate, our optimum quantizers outperform the others in terms of quality, of the coded pictures.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1454932/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1977","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1977","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"Aug. 1977","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Quantization of color signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantization of color signals","sourcePdf":"01454932.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05852S","chronDate":"Aug.  1977","isNumber":"31256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"11","articleId":"1454932","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1454933,"authors":[{"name":"Kwong-Shu Chao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Kwong-Shu Chao","id":"37267784300"},{"name":"R.

In other cases, such as for rearrangeably nonblocking connecting networks, the best construction differs from the minimum by only a constant.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The theory of connecting networks and their complexity: A review","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1977.10701","endPage":"1271","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31257/01454970.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","startPage":"1263","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1977.10701","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31257","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1454970","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Joining processes","Computer networks","Communication switching","Telephony","Sorting","Switching systems","Switching circuits","Telecommunication switching","Logic circuits","Application software"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The theory of connecting networks and their complexity: A review","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1454970/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1977","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1977","volume":"65","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1977","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The theory of connecting networks and their complexity: A review","sourcePdf":"01454970.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031886S","chronDate":"Sept.  1977","isNumber":"31257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"30","articleId":"1454970","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1454972,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

The power, complex, and phase cepstra are shown to be easily related to one another. Problems associated with phase unwrapping, linear phase components, spectrum notching, aliasing, oversampling, and extending the data sequence with zeros are discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of windowing the sampled data sequence, the log spectrum, and the complex cepstrum are presented. The influence of noise upon the data processing procedures is discussed throughout the paper, but is not thoroughly analyzed. The effects of various forms of liftering the cepstrum are described. The results obtained by applying whitening and trend removal techniques to the spectrum prior to the calculation of the cepstrum are discussed. We have attempted to synthesize the results, procedures, and information peculiar to the many fields that are finding cepstrum analysis useful. In particular we discuss the interpretation and processing of data in such areas as speech, seismology, and hydroacoustics. But we must caution the reader that the paper is heavily influenced by our own experiences; specific procedures that have been found useful in one field should not be considered as totally general to other fields. It is hoped that this review will be of value to those familiar with the field and reduce the time required for those wishing to become so.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1977.10747","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31258/01455016.pdf","startPage":"1428","endPage":"1443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1977.10747","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The cepstrum: A guide to processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1455016","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1977","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1977","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1455016/","displayDocTitle":"The cepstrum: A guide to processing","volume":"65","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1977","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The cepstrum: A guide to processing","sourcePdf":"01455016.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062149S","chronDate":"Oct.  1977","isNumber":"31258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"350","articleId":"1455016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1455037,"authors":[{"name":"R.E.

We call these methods the filter-bank summation (FBS) method and the overlap add (OLA) method. Each of these synthesis techniques has unique advantages and disadvantages in various applications due to the way in which the signal is reconstructed. In this paper we unify the ideas behind the two synthesis techniques and discuss the similarities and differences between these methods. In particular, we explicitly show the effects of modifications made to the short-time transform (both fixed and time-varying modifications are considered) on the resulting signal and discuss applications where each of the techniques would be most useful The interesting case of nonlinear modifications (possibly signal dependent) to the short-time Fourier transform is also discussed. Finally it is shown that a formal duality exists between the two synthesis methods based on the properties of the window used for obtaining the short-time Fourier transform.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1977.10770","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31259/01455039.pdf","startPage":"1558","endPage":"1564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1977.10770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A unified approach to short-time Fourier analysis and synthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1455039","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1977","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1977","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1455039/","displayDocTitle":"A unified approach to short-time Fourier analysis and synthesis","volume":"65","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1977","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified approach to short-time Fourier analysis and synthesis","sourcePdf":"01455039.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036994S","chronDate":"Nov.  1977","isNumber":"31259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"248","articleId":"1455039","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":1455040,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

In this review paper we will attempt to present the various contributions made for the sampling theorems with the necessary mathematical details to make it self-contained. We will begin by a clear statement of Shannon's sampling theorem followed by its applied interpretation for time-invariant systems. Then we will review its origin as Whittaker's interpolation series. The extensions will include sampling for functions of more than one variable, random processes, nonuniform sampling, nonband-limited functions, implicit sampling, generalized functions (distributions), sampling with the function and its derivatives as suggested by Shannon in his original paper, and sampling for general integral transforms. Also the conditions on the functions to be sampled will be summarized. The error analysis of the various sampling expansions, including specific error bounds for the truncation, aliasing, jitter and parts of various other errors will be discussed and summarized. This paper will be concluded by searching the different recent applications of the sampling theorems in other fields, besides communications theory. These include optics, crystallography, time-varying systems, boundary value problems, spline approximation, special functions, and the Fourier and other discrete transforms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1455040/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1977","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1977","publicationDate":"Nov. 1977","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","volume":"65","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Shannon sampling theorem\u2014Its various extensions and applications: A tutorial review","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Shannon sampling theorem\u2014Its various extensions and applications: A tutorial review","sourcePdf":"01455040.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126796S","chronDate":"Nov.  1977","isNumber":"31259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"1049","articleId":"1455040","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":1455052,"authors":[{"name":"I.J.

There are some comments, near the end of the paper, on the possibility of digitized-voice inputting to, and outputting from, computers in an integrated telephone-computer network.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1977.10806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31260","startPage":"1636","endPage":"1658","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31260/01455075.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1977.10806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital speech networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Packet switching","Computer networks","Switching circuits","Communication switching","Gold","Signal processing algorithms","Acoustic devices","Background noise","Oral communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1977","displayDocTitle":"Digital speech networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1455075/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1977","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","volume":"65","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1977","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital speech networks","sourcePdf":"01455075.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071747S","chronDate":"Dec.  1977","isNumber":"31260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"47","articleId":"1455075","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1455077,"authors":[{"name":"S.D.

Microprocessors are being applied very successfully where small amounts of computing power ate needed, such as in calculators, instruments, controllers, intelligent terminals, and more recently in consumer goods and games; but it remains an open problem to design a commerdally viable multiple-microprocessor structure. A variety of organizations have been proposed for such systems, and this article begins with an overview of this spectrum. Few multiple-microprocessor systems, however, have been built or otherwise subjected to a critical analysis. To address the unresolved problems facing such systems, Carnegie-Mellon University has undertaken the design, implementation, and evaluation of an experimental multi-microprocessor computer system called Cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">*</sup>\n.

Baseband pulses are video or carrierless pulses of very short duration, whose spectral content is concentrated primarily from zero frequency through the microwave region of the spectrum. Work in baseband technology began more than ten years ago at the Sperry Research Center with emphasis primarily on its use as an analytical tool, initially to explore the properties of microwave networks [1], and subsequently to determine the intrinsic properties of materials [2]. The experimental phases of these studies were aided by the pioneering development by the Hewlett-Packard Company of their sampling oscilloscope [3]. These techniques were further extended to experimentally analyze and synthesize antenna radiating and receiving elements [4], [5]. Success in the antenna area led to the development of an indoor ground-plane scattering range to measure the impulse properties of targets or obstacles [6]. This type of range obviated the need for an expensive anechoic chamber since time-gating techniques permitted unwanted reflections from the walls and ceilings to be easily eliminated. A sampling oscillosope and an instrumentation computer were used to process target-signature data as a function of illumination angle. At about the same time, analytical techniques were developed which permitted target-signature analysis to be carried out efficiently and accurately in the time domain [7]. Applications where threshold rather than target-signature data is sufficient were also investigated, and for these applications it became clear that because of cost, the sampling oscilloscope had to be replaced by a stable and fast-acting threshold device. To meet this requirement, two different types of tunnel-diode receivers were developed. The successful developmemt of these receivers, together with the design of inexpensive microwave delay-line ranging techniques, led to the evolution of BAseband Radar (BAR) or free-space time-domain reflectometry. BAR devices have been designed and recently demonstrated for various applications, including auto precollision sensing, spaceship docking, airport surface-traffic control, auto braking, tanker-ship docking, harborcollision avoidance, etc. These sensing applications cover ranges from 5 to 5000 ft [8]. In other applications, the development of high-speed subnanosecond logic has impacted the computer field, making higher speed computation possible. Further developments resulted in the construction of a subnanosecond, single coaxial cable scheme for multiplexing data between computer terminals [9]. More recently, baseband-pulse techniques have been applied to the problem of developing a short-range wireless communication link. Here, the low EM pollution and covertness of operation potentially provide the means for wireless transmission without licensing. We review the research areas described above in more detail and refer the reader to references and a comprehensive biblography where sources for detailed information can be found [10].","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-domain electromagnetics and its applications","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1978.10902","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31263/01455171.pdf","startPage":"299","endPage":"318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1978.10902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31263","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1455171","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1455171/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1978","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1978","displayDocTitle":"Time-domain electromagnetics and its applications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"March 1978","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-domain electromagnetics and its applications","sourcePdf":"01455171.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067834S","chronDate":"March  1978","isNumber":"31263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"182","articleId":"1455171","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1455172,"authors":[{"name":"M.

So-called convolutional-back projection-summation methods, used now for parallelray data, have recently been extended to special cases of the fan-beam reconstruction problem by the addition of pre- and post-multiplication steps. In this paper, a technique for deriving reconstruction algorithms for arbitrary ray-sampling schemes is presented; the resulting algorithms entail the use of a general linear operator, but require little more computation than the convolutional methods, which represent special cases. The key to the derivation is the observation that the contribution of a particular ray sum to a particular point in the reconstruction essentially depends on the negative inverse square of the perpendicular distance from the point to the ray, and that this contribution has to be weighted by the ray-sampling density. The remaining task is the efficient arrangement of this computation, so that the contribution of each ray sum to each point in the reconstruction does not have to be calculated explicitly. The exposition of the new method is informal in order to facilitate the application of this technique to various scanning geometries. The frequency domain is not used, since it is inappropriate for the space-variant operators encountered in the general case. The technique is illustrated by the derivation of an algorithm for parallel-ray sampling with uneven spacing between rays and uneven spacing between projection angles. A reconstruction is shown which attains high spatial resolution in the central region of an object by sampling central rays more finely than those passing through outer portions of the object.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31265/01455229.pdf","startPage":"551","endPage":"562","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1978.10960","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1978.10960","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1455229","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reconstruction algorithms","Geometry","Concurrent computing","Detectors","Position measurement","Particle measurements","Tomography","Electromagnetic wave absorption","Head","Heart"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1978","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1455229/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1978","displayDocTitle":"Density reconstruction using arbitrary ray-sampling schemes","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"May 1978","volume":"66","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Density reconstruction using arbitrary ray-sampling schemes","sourcePdf":"01455229.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036233S","chronDate":"May  1978","isNumber":"31265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"66","articleId":"1455229","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1455230,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The SAR comprises a pulsed transmitter, an antenna, and a phase-coherent receiver. The SAR is borne by a constant velocity vehicle such as an aircraft or satellite, with the antenna beam axis oriented obliquely to the velocity vector. The image plane is defined by the velocity vector and antenna beam axis. The image orthogonal coordinates are range and cross range (azimuth). The amplitude and phase of the received signals are collected for the duration of an integration time after which the signal is processed. High range resolution is achieved by the use of wide bandwidth transmitted pulses. High azimuth resolution is achieved by focusing, with a signal processing technique, an extremely long antenna that is synthesized from the coherent phase history. The pulse repetition frequency of the SAR is constrained within bounds established by the geometry and signal ambiguity limits. SAR operation requires relative motion between radar and target. Nominal velocity values are assumed for signal processing and measurable deviations are used for error compensation. Residual uncertainties and high-order derivatives of the velocity which are difficult to compensate may cause image smearing, defocusing, and increased image sidelobes. The SAR transforms the ocean surface into numerous small cells, each with dimensions of range and azimuth resolution. An image of a cell can be produced provided the radar cross section of the cell is sufficiently large and the cell phase history is deterministic. Ocean waves evidently move sufficiently uniformly to produce SAR images which correlate well with optical photographs and visual observations. The relationship between SAR images and oceanic physical features is not completely understood, and more analyses and investigations are desired.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1978.10961","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31265/01455230.pdf","startPage":"563","endPage":"583","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1978.10961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tutorial review of synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) with applications to imaging of the ocean surface","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1978","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1455230/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1978","displayDocTitle":"Tutorial review of synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) with applications to imaging of the ocean surface","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","volume":"66","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1978","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tutorial review of synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) with applications to imaging of the ocean surface","sourcePdf":"01455230.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055029S","chronDate":"May  1978","isNumber":"31265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"223","articleId":"1455230","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1455261,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

Applications include 1) outgoingwave systems for maximizing the power density of a laser beam on a target and 2) received-wave systems for maximizing the angular resolving power of a telescope viewing a distant object through a turbulent atmosphere. In this tutorial-review paper, the basic concepts of active optics systems and their historical evolution are discussed, from early figurecontrol systems with a servo bandwidth of less than 1 Hz to the recently developed high-bandwidth systems for atmospheric compensation with bandwidths of several hundred hertz. A critical comparison of the various approaches to wavefront sensing is then made covering both coherent (laser) and incoherent (white-light)systems. Current techniques for wavefront correction including Bragg cells, segmented mirrors, thin-plate deformable mirrors, monolithic mirrms, and membrane mirrors are described. The performance analysis and optimization of closed loop systems is covered using two basic models. The paper concludes with a review of the design and performance of five current experimental active optical systems, with some comments on future applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1455261/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1978","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1978","publicationDate":"June 1978","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","volume":"66","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Active optics: A new technology for the control of light","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active optics: A new technology for the control of light","sourcePdf":"01455261.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045525S","chronDate":"June  1978","isNumber":"31266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"19","articleId":"1455261","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1455263,"authors":[{"name":"W.K.

In particular, applications of this study to stability of multidimensional recursive digital and continuous filters, to synthesis of network with commensurate and noncommensurate transmission lines, and to numerical stability of stiff differential equations are enumerated. A novel approach to the multidimensional stability study is the classification of various regions of analyticity. Various computational tests for checking these regions are presented. These include the classical ones based on inners and symmetric matrix approach, table form, local positivity, Lyapunov test, the impulse response tests, the cepstral method and the graphical ones based on Nyquist-like tests. A thorough discussion and comparison of the computational complexities which arise in the various tests are included. A critical view of the progress made during the last two decades on multidimensional stability is presented in the conclusions. The latter also includes some research topics for future investigations.

It is of prime importance to have a comprehensive characterization of these instabilities in order to be able to assess the potential utility of each source. For that purpose, many parameters have been proposed especially for dealing with random fluctuations. Some of them have been recommended by the IEEE Subcommittee on Frequency Stability and later by Study Group 7 on \"Standard Frequencies and Time Signals\" of the International Radio Consultative Committee (CCIR). Others are not so widely used but show interesting capabilities. This paper aims at giving a broad review of parameters proposed for phase and frequency instability characterization, including both classical widely used concepts and more recent less familiar approaches. Transfer functions that link frequency-domain and time-domain parameters are emphasized because they provide improved understanding of the properties of a given time-domain parameter or facilitate introducing of new parameters. As far as new approaches are concerned, an attempt has been made to demonstrate clearly their respective advantages. To this end, some developments that did not appear in the original references ate presented here, e.g, the modified three sample variance \u03a3\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">y</inf>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n(\u03c4), the expressions of \u3008\u03b4y\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-</sup>\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T</inf>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n\u3009, the intetpretation of structure functions of phase and its relations with \u03a3\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">y</inf>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n(\u03c4) and the Hadamard variance.

Most recently it has been proposed as a fault-tolerant central computer for civil transport aircraft applications. A working emulation has been operating for some time, and the first engineering prototype is scheduled to be completed in late 1979. FTMP is designed to have a failure rate due to random causes of the order of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-10</sup>\nfailures per hour, on ten-hour flights where no air-borne maintenance is available. The prefered maintenance interval is of the order of hundreds of flight hours, and the probability that maintenance will be required earlier than the preferred interval is desired to be at most a few percent. The design is based on independent processor-cache memory modules and common memory modules which communicate via redundant serial buses. All information processing and transmission is conducted in triplicate so that local voters in each module can correct errors. Modules can be retired and/or reassigned in any configuration. Reconfiguration is carried out routinely from second to second to search for latent faults in the voting and reconfiguration elements. Job assignments are all made on a floating basis, so that any processor triad is eligible to execute any job step. The core software in the FFMP will handle all fault detection, diagnosis, and recovery in such a way that applications programs do not need to be involved. Failure-rate models and numerical results are described for both permanent and intermittent faults. A dispatch probability model is also presented. Experience with an experimental emulation is described.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1978","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1978","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1455382/","volume":"66","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1978","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"FTMP\u2014A highly reliable fault-tolerant multiprocess for aircraft","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FTMP\u2014A highly reliable fault-tolerant multiprocess for aircraft","sourcePdf":"01455382.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043584S","chronDate":"Oct.  1978","isNumber":"31270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"253","articleId":"1455382","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1455383,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.

The main processing units are off-the-shelf minicomputers, with standard microcomputers serving as the interface to the I/O system. Fault isolation is achieved by using a specially designed redundant bus system to interconnect the proeessing units. Error detection and analysis and system reconfiguration are performed by software. Iterative tasks are redundantly executed, and the results of each iteration are voted upon before being used. Thus, any single failure in a processing unit or bus can be tolerated with triplication of tasks, and subsequent failures can be tolerated after reconfiguration. Independent execution by separate processors means that the processors need only be loosely synchronized, and a novel fault-tolerant synchronization method is described. The SIFT software is highly structured and is formally specified using the SRI-developed SPECIAL language. The correctness of SIFT is to be proved using a hierarchy of formal models. A Markov model is used both to analyze the reliability of the system and to serve as the formal requirement for the SIFT design. Axioms are given to characterize the high-level behavior of the system, from which a correctness statement has been proved. An engineering test version of SIFT is currently being built.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31270","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31270/01455383.pdf","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1978.11114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1978.11114","startPage":"1240","endPage":"1255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SIFT: Design and analysis of a fault-tolerant computer for aircraft control","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1978","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1978","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1455383/","displayDocTitle":"SIFT: Design and analysis of a fault-tolerant computer for aircraft control","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"Oct. 1978","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SIFT: Design and analysis of a fault-tolerant computer for aircraft control","sourcePdf":"01455383.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035609S","chronDate":"Oct.  1978","isNumber":"31270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"353","articleId":"1455383","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1455418,"authors":[{"name":"F.A.

Local area networks use this low-east, high-speed transmission capabality as the basis for a general-purpose data transfer network. There are two basic issues in local area network design. First, how should the hardware realizing the network be organized to provide reliable high-speed communication at minimum cost? With the low cost of the raw transmission capability, care is required to keep the associated hardware costs correspondingly low. Second, what protocols should be used for the operation of the network? While many protocol problems are common to local area networks and long-haul networks such as the ARPANET, new protocols are required to exploit the extended capabilities of local area networks. This paper addresses these two basic issues. It also considers the interconnection of local area networks and long-haul networks and presents a case study which describes in detail the host computer interface hard-ware required for a typical local area network.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1978.11152","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31271/01455421.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1978.11152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31271","startPage":"1497","endPage":"1517","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An introduction to local area networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1455421","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An introduction to local area networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1978","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1455421/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1978","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1978","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An introduction to local area networks","sourcePdf":"01455421.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071733S","chronDate":"Nov.  1978","isNumber":"31271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"63","articleId":"1455421","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1455439,"authors":[{"name":"A.W.

Multiple access, a 60-dB dynamic range, and 0.75 percent linearity were achieved with the former, while the latter correlated 255 chips in a double-sampled configuration.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1979.11202","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31273/01455471.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1979.11202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31273","startPage":"50","endPage":"60","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Charge-coupled device pseudo-noise matched filter design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1455471","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Charge-coupled device pseudo-noise matched filter design","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1979","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1455471/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1979","isJournal":true,"volume":"67","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1979","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Charge-coupled device pseudo-noise matched filter design","sourcePdf":"01455471.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029922S","chronDate":"Jan.  1979","isNumber":"31273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"19","articleId":"1455471","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1455472,"authors":[{"name":"R.W.

An analog signal sample can be represented by an isolated quantity of charge and such packets of charge can be stored, transferred, and manipulated in other ways to perform signal processing operations. Best known of these techniques is the use of a charge-coupled device (CCD) to operate as an analog shift register. A simple modification of the CCD shift register allows the realization of transversal filters. Other techniques can implement recursive filter operations offering a great flexibility for filter design. The possibilities and limitations of charge-transfer filtering are reviewed and examined.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1979.11232","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31274/01455501.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1979.11232","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","startPage":"196","endPage":"218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Charge-transfer filtering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1455501","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1979","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1979","displayDocTitle":"Charge-transfer filtering","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1455501/","volume":"67","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1979","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Charge-transfer filtering","sourcePdf":"01455501.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093343S","chronDate":"Feb.  1979","isNumber":"31274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"24","articleId":"1455501","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1455502,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Each individual response case involves the step-by-step numerical solution in the time domain of perhaps thousands of nonlinear differential-algebraic equations, at a cost of up to several thousand dollars. A high premium is thus to be placed on the use of the most efficient and reliable modern calculation techniques. This paper is a critical tutorial-review of the calculation methods used routinely or investigated for use by the industry. It concentrates on solution concepts and computational techniques rather than on the analysis of the numerical methods. Details of system modeling are only emphasized when they affect the choice of solution method. The paper concludes with a view of the state of the art and a prediction of future directions of development.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system dynamics","Power engineering and energy","Power industry","Power system stability","Computational modeling","Power system simulation","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Power engineering computing","Differential equations","Nonlinear equations"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1979.11233","startPage":"219","endPage":"241","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31274/01455502.pdf","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1979.11233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power system dynamic response calculations","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1979","displayDocTitle":"Power system dynamic response calculations","publicationDate":"Feb. 1979","volume":"67","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1455502/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1979","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power system dynamic response calculations","sourcePdf":"01455502.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044668S","chronDate":"Feb.  1979","isNumber":"31274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"193","articleId":"1455502","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1455508,"authors":[{"name":"N.K.

By combining the computer with X rays it is possible (in principle) to obtain tomographic images of any cross section in the human body. These techniques are now used for medical diagnosis in all the major hospitals of the world. But X rays are not the only kind of radiation for which computer-assisted tomography is feasible. Microwaves, electron beams, ultrasound, fast subatomic particles from accelerators, gamma rays from such sources as positron annihilation, and even magnetic fields can also be used. This paper is mainly concerned with ultrasound. Acoustic energy can often give a view of a cross section not available with X rays or other types of radiation. A mapping of acoustic and elastic discontinuities can be expected to give a basically different pattern than a mapping of X-ray absorption and scattering coefficients. Several methods of ultrasonic tomography are discussed including methods based on geometric optics and a Doppler-oriented approach. A major portion of the paper is concerned with introducing ways to take into account diffraction effects. Because of the wavelength differences, these effects are far more important for ultrasound than for X rays.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1979.11284","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31276/01455553.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1979.11284","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","startPage":"567","endPage":"587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstructive tomography and applications to ultrasonics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1455553","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1979","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1979","displayDocTitle":"Reconstructive tomography and applications to ultrasonics","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1455553/","volume":"67","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1979","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstructive tomography and applications to ultrasonics","sourcePdf":"01455553.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05567S","chronDate":"April  1979","isNumber":"31276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"306","articleId":"1455553","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1455578,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The domains of deployment of these individual components (classifiers) are determined by optimal partitioning of the problem space. The criterion for such optimal partitioning is determined in each case by the characteristics of the classifier components. An example, in terms of partitioning the feature space for optimal deployment of a composite system consisting of the linear and nearest neighbor (NN) classifiers as its components, is presented to illustrate the concepts, the associated methodology, and the possible benefits one could expect through such composite classifier system design. Here, the optimality of the partitioning is dictated by the linear class separability limitation of the linear classifier and the computational demand characteristics of the NN classifier. Accordingly, the criterion for the optimal feature space partitioning is set to be the minimization of the domain of application of the NN classifier, subject to the constraint that the linear classifier is to be deployed only in regions satisfying the underlying assumption of linear separability of classes. While many alternatives are available for the solution of the resulting constrained optimization problem, a specific technique-Sequential Weight Increasing Factor Technique (SWIFT)- was employed here for convenience in view of previous successful experience with this technique in other application areas. Numerical results derived using the well-known IRIS data set are furnished to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new concepts and methodology.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1455590/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1979","publicationDate":"May 1979","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","volume":"67","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A composite classifier system design: Concepts and methodology","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A composite classifier system design: Concepts and methodology","sourcePdf":"01455590.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037764S","chronDate":"May  1979","isNumber":"31277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"138","articleId":"1455590","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1455594,"authors":[{"name":"I.E.

The technique does not require training prototypes but operates in an \"unsupervised\" mode. The features most useful for the given image to be segmented are retained by the algorithm without human interaction, by rejecting those attributes which do not contribute to homogeneous clustering in N-dimensional vector space. The basic procedure is a K-means clustering algorithm which converges to a local minimum in the average squared intercluster distance for a specified number of clusters. The algorithm iterates on the number of clusters, evaluating the clustering based on a parameter of clustering quality. The parameter proposed is a product of between and within cluster scatter measures, which achieves a maximum value that is postulated to represent an intrinsic number of clusters in the data. At this value, feature rejection is implemented via a Bhattacharyya measure to make the image segments more homogeneous (thereby removing \"noisy\" features); and reclustering is performed. The resulting parameter of clustering fidelity is maximized with segmented imagery resulting in psychovisually pleasing and culturally logical image segments.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31277/01455596.pdf","startPage":"773","endPage":"785","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1979.11327","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1979.11327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31277","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1455596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image segmentation by clustering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Clustering algorithms","Image recognition","Mathematical model","Prototypes","Humans","Image converters","Scattering parameters","Performance evaluation","Psychology"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1455596/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1979","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1979","displayDocTitle":"Image segmentation by clustering","volume":"67","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1979","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image segmentation by clustering","sourcePdf":"01455596.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067474S","chronDate":"May  1979","isNumber":"31277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"280","articleId":"1455596","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1455597,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

The optical space-variant pattern-recognition systems described are examples of the growing repertoire of operations now achievable in optical computers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1455599/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1979","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"May 1979","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","volume":"67","issue":"5","displayDocTitle":"Coherent optical pattern recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent optical pattern recognition","sourcePdf":"01455599.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0438S","chronDate":"May  1979","isNumber":"31277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"8","articleId":"1455599","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1455600,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The value of each element in the new array is determined by its value in the original array and the orginal values of its nearest neighbors. The neighborhood configuration (tessellation) is usually called the \"cell\"; whence the term \"cellular logic.\" CLO's may be categorized acording to the tessellation in which they are embedded and according to the type or types of CLO sequences: sequences which are carried out in a single step; those which iterate the same CLO for many steps; those which repetitively alternate subsequences of CLO strings. The effect of the CLO sequence on the contents of the data array is frequently one of boundary modification. Depending on the CLO sequence(s) utilized, a boundary may be expanded to form the convex hull, or reduced so as to form the convex kernel, skeleton, or residue. As of 1977, cellular logic computers have become a commercial product in biomedical image processing where they are used in clinical instruments whose purpose is to classify white blood cell images at rates of several thousand per hour. Many other applications are foreseen and, as further examples, preliminary results in automatic X-ray image analysis and tissue image analysis are presented.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1979.11331","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31277/01455600.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1979.11331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31277","startPage":"826","endPage":"856","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Basics of cellular logic with some applications in medical image processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1455600","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Basics of cellular logic with some applications in medical image processing","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1979","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1455600/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1979","isJournal":true,"volume":"67","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1979","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Basics of cellular logic with some applications in medical image processing","sourcePdf":"01455600.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134339S","chronDate":"May  1979","isNumber":"31277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"124","articleId":"1455600","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1455623,"authors":[{"name":"R.G.

For many applications, this input rate, which may be significantly higher than the Nyquist rate required for waveform reconstruction, places stringent requirements on A/D converter hardware and transmission cable bandwidth. Recently, a technique referred to as digital interpolation beamfonning was introduced which greatly relaxes the sampling requirement and provides substantial hardware savings through more flexible design options. In this approach, the sensor channels need only be sampled at a rate which satisfies aliasing requirements. The vernier beam-delay increments are then synthesized using digital interpolation which can be implemented at the beamformer input or output to minimize digital processing complexity. Previously, this concept was presented for the case of \"low-pass\" signals. This paper extends this work by examining the relationship between interpolation and beamforming for the important class of \"bandpass\" signals. Specifically, sampling methods are discussed whereby the original waveform can be reconstructed from samples taken at a rate consistent with the bandwidth of the bandpass signal. Beamformer implementations are presented which utilize these bandwidth-sampling techniques in conjunction with interpolation and which compute beam output points at the generally low rate dictated by the signal bandwidth. The interpolation beamformer achieves time-delay quantization (beam-steering accuracy) independent of both the input and output sampling rates. This approach generally requires less hardware than conventional procedures. Interpolation falter characteristics dictated by the bandwidth-sampling procedure are described and efficient methods of implementation employing nonrecursive digital bandpass and low-pass filters are presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital interpolation beamforming for low-pass and bandpass signals","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1979.11354","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31278/01455623.pdf","startPage":"904","endPage":"919","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1979.11354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31278","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1455623","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1455623/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1979","displayDocTitle":"Digital interpolation beamforming for low-pass and bandpass signals","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"67","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"June 1979","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital interpolation beamforming for low-pass and bandpass signals","sourcePdf":"01455623.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039884S","chronDate":"June  1979","isNumber":"31278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"114","articleId":"1455623","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1455625,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

Included are methods for signal representation, linear system implementation, frequency response calculation, DFT calculation, filter design, and filter implementation.

Better surface truth and controlled experiments are still needed to obtain a more specific value for \u03b3 under a given condition. Theoretical modeling of radar sea scatter indicates that near vertical incidence the physical optics method is applicable while for incidence angles approximately in the range 30\u00b0 to 80\u00b0 the return can be explained by Bragg scattering due to capillary waves when the tilting effect of the large-scale waves is also included.

One objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the variety of techniques that have been proposed for enhancement and bandwidth compression of speech degraded by additive background noise.

It has been shown that electrophysiological auditory activity may be elicited by exposing the brains of laboratory animals to rectangular pulses of microwave energy. These results suggest that a microwave auditory phenomenon is evoked by a mechanism similar to that responsible for conventional sound reception and that the primary site of interaction resides peripheral to the cochlea. A comparison of the pressure amplitudes, such as those produced in a homogeneous planar layer of brain matter that is irradiated by a microwave pulse, indicates that the peak pressure due to thermal expansion is much greater than either radiation pressure or electrostriction. Theoretical analyses for a spherical brain based on the thermoelastic mechanism of interaction were found to agree with experimentally observed characteristics and indicate also that the induced sound frequency is only a function of the size and acoustic property of the brain. A few suggestions have been made for future research aimed at furthering our knowledge on microwave auditory effect and its health implications.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31285/01455852.pdf","startPage":"67","endPage":"73","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1980.11583","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1980.11583","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1455852","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustic pulses","Humans","Animals","Frequency","Laboratories","Cats","Rats","Acoustic waves","Electromagnetic fields","Electromagnetic radiation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1455852/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1980","displayDocTitle":"The microwave auditory phenomenon","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"Jan. 1980","volume":"68","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The microwave auditory phenomenon","sourcePdf":"01455852.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033681S","chronDate":"Jan.  1980","isNumber":"31285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"44","articleId":"1455852","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1455858,"authors":[{"name":"H.P.

They may be viewed as generalizations of polynomials because they admit power series expansions that converge everywhere. Entire functions are useful models for physical phenomena having finite \"spectra,\" such as important classes of time-varying signals and spatially varying fields. Entire function models may be studied through the linear expansion techniques (e.g., Fourier series and integrals) familiar to most engineers, but product expansions akin to polynomial factorizations provide a less familiar alternative which is often more powerful when phenomena have a nonlinear character. This paper provides a tutorial introduction to relevant aspects of the theory of entire functions of a single complex variable, and also a discussion of exemplary applications. The paper deals specifically with a class of entire functions of exponential type, dubbed B-functions, which contain all functions that are band limited according to the variious extant definitions of bandlimitation. Product expansions are emphasized because they lead one to regard the real and complex zeros of a B-function as its information bearing attributes. This view leads naturally to the study of sampling, clipping, and similar applications, and to more general issues concerned with the sufficiency of zero-based representations and the recovery of a B-function's waveform from a zero-based representation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31287","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31287/01455913.pdf","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1980.11644","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1980.11644","startPage":"308","endPage":"328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The zeros of entire functions: Theory and engineering applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1980","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1455913/","displayDocTitle":"The zeros of entire functions: Theory and engineering applications","isJournal":true,"volume":"68","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"March 1980","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The zeros of entire functions: Theory and engineering applications","sourcePdf":"01455913.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057477S","chronDate":"March  1980","isNumber":"31287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"97","articleId":"1455913","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1455914,"authors":[{"name":"G.L.

The most effective method is a computationally efficient method for realization of maximum likelihood or maximum posterior probability estimates of the frequencies. The second method is a class of algorithms for removing some of the deficiencies of present adaptive filtering and correlation-estimation approaches to estimation of frequencies, such as the forward-backward linear prediction method. In both of these new methods one is fitting a signal model to data. In method 1 the data are the observed samples of two complex sinusoids plus noise.

Theoretical results show how specific arrangements of physically realizable SAW chirp filters permit Fourier transformation of both baseband and IF input signals. The operation of SAW Fourier-transform processors, with separate real- and imaginary-baseband inputs, highlights their use as wide-band \"FFT-type\" processors. The application of individual SAW-based processors to spectrum analysis, network analysis, beamforming, and frequency-hopped wave-form synthesis is discussed and demonstrated. Finally, the use of combinations of two or more SAW Fourier-transform processors for cepstrum analysis and programmable correlation is described.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1980.11674","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31288/01455943.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1980.11674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31288","startPage":"450","endPage":"468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The theory, design, and applications of surface acoustic wave Fourier-transform processors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1455943","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The theory, design, and applications of surface acoustic wave Fourier-transform processors","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1455943/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1980","isJournal":true,"volume":"68","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1980","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The theory, design, and applications of surface acoustic wave Fourier-transform processors","sourcePdf":"01455943.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069347S","chronDate":"April  1980","isNumber":"31288","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"71","articleId":"1455943","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1455944,"authors":[{"name":"C.Y.

Differential encoding structures employing adaptive quantization and adaptive prediction constitute one of the most promising approaches to achieving these design objectives. This paper focuses on the design and analysis of adaptive predictors for differential encoders. Several differential encoding systems, including adaptive predictive coding, differential pulse-code modulation, noise feedback coding, direct feedback coding, and prediction error coding, are described and related. Adaptive quantizers are briefly discussed and quantitative and qualitative indicators of speech coder performance are defined. The channel model, the speech model, and the research problem statements used in the design of differential encoders and adaptive predictors are presented. The nomenclature and theory of forward and backward adaptive prediction are developed, and several new backward adaptive algorithms based on various assumptions are presented. A detailed survey of theoretical and simulation results on adaptive prediction for speech differential encoders is given, and the effects of background and transmission impairments on these systems are discussed, Finally, the impact of adaptive predictors on rate distortion theory motivated coders is indicated. Numerous areas for future research are highlighted.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1455945/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1980","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1980","volume":"68","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"April 1980","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive prediction in speech differential encoding systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive prediction in speech differential encoding systems","sourcePdf":"01455945.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11277S","chronDate":"April  1980","isNumber":"31288","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"103","articleId":"1455945","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1455947,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Soderstrand","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Soderstrand","id":"37271403000"},{"name":"C.

For the early applications, m-sequences were used primarily because of their excellent periodic autocorrelation properties. For many of the recent systems applications, however, the crosscorrelation properties of such sequences are at least as important as the autocorrelation properties, and the system performance depends upon the aperiodic correlation in addition to the periodic correlation. This paper presents a survey of recent results and provides several new results on the periodic and aperiodic crosscorrelation functions for pairs of m-sequences and for pairs of related (but not maximal-length) binary shift register sequences. Also included are several recent results on correlation for complex-valued sequences as well as identities relating the crosscorrelation functions to autocorrelation functions. Examples of problems in spread-spectrum communications are employed to motivate the choice of correlation parameters that are considered in the paper.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1980.11697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31289","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1980.11697","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31289/01455966.pdf","startPage":"593","endPage":"619","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crosscorrelation properties of pseudorandom and related sequences","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1980","displayDocTitle":"Crosscorrelation properties of pseudorandom and related sequences","volume":"68","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1980","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1455966/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crosscorrelation properties of pseudorandom and related sequences","sourcePdf":"01455966.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161031S","chronDate":"May  1980","isNumber":"31289","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"1125","articleId":"1455966","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1455987,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Chi Ho","affiliation":["Division of Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Yu-Chi Ho","id":"37347423000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2256"}],"articleNumber":"1455987","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":159,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":911},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision theory","Decision making","Rain","Uncertainty","Cities and towns","Information theory"]}],"abstract":"This tutorial-survey paper introduces the problems of decentralized statistical decision making (team theory) where the decision makers have access to different information concerning the underlying uncertainties.

This paper is primarily a \"cross-fertilization\" treatise which takes the two most popular nonlinear techniques, the Burg maximum entropy method and the maximum likelihood method, and relates them to their similar nonlinear adaptive array antenna counterparts, which consist of the generic sidelobe canceller and directional gain constraint techniques. The comparison analysis permits an examination of their principles of operation from the antenna spatial pattern viewpoint, and helps to qualify, their actual superresolution performance. A summary of the resolution performance of several adaptive algorithms against multiple-incoherent sources is provided, including a universal graph of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) versus source separation in beamwidths for the case of two equal-strength sources. Also, a significant dividend in the easy resolution of unequal-strength sources is reported. The superresolution of coherent spatial sources or radar targets is more difficult for these techniques, but successful results have been obtained whenever sufficient relative motion or \"Doppler cycles\" are available. Two alternate adaptive spatial spectrum estimators are suggested, consisting of a circular array predicting to its center point, and a new \"thermal noise\" algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1980.11719","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31290/01455988.pdf","startPage":"654","endPage":"666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1980.11719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral analysis and adaptive array superresolution techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1455988/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1980","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1980","displayDocTitle":"Spectral analysis and adaptive array superresolution techniques","volume":"68","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1980","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral analysis and adaptive array superresolution techniques","sourcePdf":"01455988.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049034S","chronDate":"June  1980","isNumber":"31290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"200","articleId":"1455988","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1455990,"authors":[{"name":"D.

A one-dimensional coding scheme is used in which run lengths are encoded using a modified Huffman code. This allows typical A4 size documents in the form of black and white images scanned at normal resolution (3.85 lines/mm, 1728 pels/line) to be transmitted in an average time of about a minute at a rate of 4800 bit/s. The Recommendation also includes a two-dimensional code, known as the modified relative element address designate (READ) code, which is in the form of an optional extension to the one-dimensional code. This extension allows typical documents scanned at high (twice normal) resolution (with every fourth line one dimensionally coded) to be transmitted in an average time of about 75 s at 4800 bit/s. This paper describes the coding schemes in detail and discusses the factors which led to their choice. In addition, this paper assesses the performance of the codes, particularly in relation to their compression efficiency and vulnerability to transmission errors, making use of 8 CCITT reference documents.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1980.11751","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31291/01456020.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1980.11751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31291","startPage":"854","endPage":"867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"International digital facsimile coding standards","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1456020","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"International digital facsimile coding standards","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456020/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1980","isJournal":true,"volume":"68","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1980","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"International digital facsimile coding standards","sourcePdf":"01456020.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056807S","chronDate":"July  1980","isNumber":"31291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"129","articleId":"1456020","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1456023,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The methods are such that an initial segment of the transmission permits the receiving device to construct an approximate picture; as transmission proceeds, the receiver progressively constructs better approximations. Some of the low-bandwidth channel usages include telebrowsing -where one wants to abort transmission of unwanted pictures as soon as they are recognized, and teleconferencing-where one wants to receive a gestalt first, followed by the details. In the method for grey-scale pictures, the transmitter first defines a hierarchical structure of picture subdivisions, and assigns, simply by table lookup, approximate average light values to all pairs of cells from the smallest size to that encompassing the entire picture. During tranmission the latter \"primary\" value is sent, followed by numbers which permit successive cell splitting, thus producing progressively finer picture representations in approximate values, culminating in an exact reconstruction at the pel level. A picture of p pels quantized into b bits each is perfectly reconstructed upon receipt of exactly b \u00d7 p bits. If the recipient deems an intermediate version satisfactory, then \"picture compression\" is effectively achieved. This scheme thus provides some of the benefits of transform encoding (Fourier, Hadamard, Hotelling, singular-value decomposition) but with no truncation error and no need for handling coefficients of various sizes. Furthermore, computation varies only linearly with number of pels. The method for binary (B/W) pictures also involves a hierarchical structuring of the picture but with attention paid to picture compression-by declaring subdivisions, at as high a level as possible, to be solid black or solid white (and in need of no further description). Compressions thus achieved are 8:1 in cases where the \"blob\" coding method of Frank gives 11\u00bd:1","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1980.11754","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31291/01456023.pdf","startPage":"885","endPage":"896","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1980.11754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Progressive transmission of grey-scale and binary pictures by simple, efficient, and lossless encoding schemes","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1980","displayDocTitle":"Progressive transmission of grey-scale and binary pictures by simple, efficient, and lossless encoding schemes","volume":"68","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456023/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1980","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Progressive transmission of grey-scale and binary pictures by simple, efficient, and lossless encoding schemes","sourcePdf":"01456023.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078156S","chronDate":"July  1980","isNumber":"31291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"49","articleId":"1456023","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1456043,"authors":[{"name":"M.M.

Various methods of echo control have been used for over 50 years but recent introduction of transmission delays in excess of 300 ms, over satellite circuits, has resulted in a general reexamination of suppression methods. This led to development of the echo canceller. Adaptive echo cancellation is accomplished by automatically synthesizing a replica of the echo path response, convolving the incoming signal with the replica and subtracting the resulting echo estimate from the echo path output. Transmission is not thereby interrupted in any way and two-way information transmission proceeds normally with little or no echo. Detailed mathematical formulations for the convergence properties of such devices allow understanding of the effects of various hardware configurations and input signal properties. Echo cancellers may be applied to the network in a number of ways and the development of a VLSI canceller chip promises inexpensive implementation of these applications. Worldwide tests have shown the effectiveness of cancellation methods for satellite transmission.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1980.11774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31292","startPage":"948","endPage":"963","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31292/01456043.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Silencing echoes on the telephone network","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456043/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1980","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1980","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Silencing echoes on the telephone network","publicationDate":"Aug. 1980","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"68","issue":"8","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Silencing echoes on the telephone network","sourcePdf":"01456043.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103972S","chronDate":"Aug.  1980","isNumber":"31292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"148","articleId":"1456043","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1456045,"authors":[{"name":"P.R.

Development on optical transmission systems is found to be most advanced for short-haul interoffice systems, with many countries in the world already having systems in commercial use. This is largely due to the amount of demand that exists in this field, and that insufficient laser diode reliability does not permit constructing a long-haul optical circuit. However, from an economical viewpoint, optical transmission systems introduction into long-haul trunk lines is quite attractive. This paper reports the results of a survey on some economic and reliability aspects of the system, together with the technology state of the art. Attainable repeater spacings are estimated after detailed consideration of optical-fiber loss and dispersion. Some experimental results are also shown to clarify the transmission characteristics for high-speed signals and long repeater spacing systems. Based on the survey, future developmental targets are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1980.11849","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31294/01456118.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1980.11849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31294","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","startPage":"1304","endPage":"1309","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1980","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Systems engineering for long-haul optical-fiber transmission","volume":"68","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456118/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1980","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systems engineering for long-haul optical-fiber transmission","sourcePdf":"01456118.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020061S","chronDate":"Oct.  1980","isNumber":"31294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"21","articleId":"1456118","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1456125,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

The focus is on broadcast, multiple access, relay, and other channels for which the recent theory is relativdy well developed. A discussion of the Gaussian version of these channels demonstrates the concreteness of the encoding and decoding necessary to achieve optimal information flow.

A restricted class of graphs, called disk graphs, plays a central role in frequency-distance constrained problems. We introduce two generalizations of chromatic number and show that many frequency assignment problems are equivalent to generalized graph coloring problems.

All exhibit roughly exponential increase in cost factors with performance increase beyond the robust range. This paper reviews these limitations. Electrically small antennas are analyzed via spherical mode theory, with the antenna enclosed in a virtual sphere. Minimum Q varies inversely as the cube of sphere radius in radian wavelengths when the radius is much less than the latter. This limits the achievable bandwidth. Superdirective apertures require a constraint; the optimization is generally intractable except for line sources. Superdirective arrays have spacing below half-wavelength, and for small spacings a constraint is desirable to limit Q, tolerances, efficiency, sidelobes, etc. This is accomplished by expressing constrained directivity as a ratio of two Hermilian quadratic forms, for which a solution exists. Array Q varies exponentially with directivity so only modest increases are practical. Superresolution arrays use maximum entropy processes to improve spatial frequency resolution for short samples (short arrays), analogous to spectral analysis processing. An amplitude-tapered autocorrelation function is extended by linear least square prediction and autoregression; the latter contributes filter poles. This extension is with minimum added information, hence maximum entropy. In contrast to superdirective arrays which are all zero functions, superresolution maximum entropy uses an all pole function. Results are dependent upon the sampling subarray size and upon signal/noise (S/N). Required S/N increases exponentially with inverse angular resolution. Achievable gain of high-gain reflector antennas is limited by cost of the structure. For random surface errors maximum gain is proportional to the mechanical tolerance ratio (antenna diameter/1\u03c3 tolerance) squared. Since cost increases rapidly with diameter and with tolerance ratio this comprises a gain limitation. Current best reflectors have maximum gain in the range of 90 to 100 dB.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1981.11950","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31298/01456218.pdf","startPage":"170","endPage":"182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1981.11950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamental limitations in antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1456218","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1981","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456218/","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental limitations in antennas","volume":"69","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1981","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental limitations in antennas","sourcePdf":"01456218.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036504S","chronDate":"Feb.  1981","isNumber":"31298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"381","articleId":"1456218","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":1456220,"authors":[{"name":"R.K.

Starting with simple techniques of sampling and pulse code modulation (PCM), state of the art algorithms for two-dimensional data transmission are reviewed. Topics covered include differential PCM (DPCM) and predictive coding, transform coding, hybrid coding, interframe coding, adaptive techniques, and applications. Effects of channel errors and other miscellaneous related topics are also considered. While most of the examples and image models have been specialized for visual images, the techniques discussed here could be easily adapted more generally for multidimensional data compression.

The DPLL represents the heart of the Building blocks required in the implementation of coherent (all digital) communications and tracking receivers. This survey is particularly motivated by the fact that microprocessor technology is advancing rapidly to the extent that sophisticated and flexible signal processing algorithms for communications and control can be realized in the digital domain. In fact, it is anticipated that the use of this signal processing technology will continue to expand rapidly in the development of advanced communications and tracking receivers, e.g., all digital modems. Consequently, one major purpose of this paper is to provide the reader with a survey and an overview of the theoretical and experimental work accomplished to date, thereby offering speedy access to the techniques and hardware developments which have been presented in a scattered literature. In addition, the authors feel that a tutorial article revealing the various theories, their relationships to one another, their shortcomings, their advantages and the assumptions on which each is based, would be of tremendous value to the engineer trying to decide what particular analysis procedure is applicable to his peculiar problem. Consequently, a byproduct of this presentation will be to point out unsolved problems of practical interest. A broad class of digital modulation techniques, viz. I-Q modulations and demodulation, are studied in a rather general way.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1981.11986","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31300/01456254.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1981.11986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31300","startPage":"410","endPage":"431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A survey of digital phase-locked loops","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1456254","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A survey of digital phase-locked loops","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1981","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456254/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1981","isJournal":true,"volume":"69","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1981","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A survey of digital phase-locked loops","sourcePdf":"01456254.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089469S","chronDate":"April  1981","isNumber":"31300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"400","articleId":"1456254","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":1456255,"authors":[{"name":"R.W.

These techniques also allow for the incorporation of prior knowledge of the signal in terms of the specification of a constraint operator. Conditions for convergence of the iteration under various combinations of distortions and constraints are explored. Particular attention is given to the use of iterative restoration techniques for constrained deconvolution, when the distortion band-limits the signal and spectral extrapolation must be performed. It is shown that by predistorting the signal (and later removing this predistortion) it is possible to achieve spectral extrapolation, to broaden the class of signals for which these algorithms achieve convergence, and to improve their performance in the presence of broad-band noise.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1981","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456255/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1981","volume":"69","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1981","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Constrained iterative restoration algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constrained iterative restoration algorithms","sourcePdf":"01456255.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056875S","chronDate":"April  1981","isNumber":"31300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"309","articleId":"1456255","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1456261,"authors":[{"name":"N.J.

Furthermore, under a variety of conditions, such as when a signal is of finite length, phase information alone is sufficient to completely reconstruct a signal to within a scale factor. In this paper, we review and discuss these observations and results in a number of different contexts and applications. Specifically, the intelligibility of phase-only reconstruction for images, speech, and crystallographic structures are illustrated. Several approaches to justifying the relative importance of phase through statistical arguments are presented, along with a number of informal arguments suggesting reasons for the importance of phase. Specific conditions under which a sequence can be exactly reconstructed from phase are reviewed, both for one-dimensional and multi-dimensional sequences, and algorithms for both approximate and exact reconstruction of signals from phase information are presented. A number of applications of the observations and results in this paper are suggested.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1981.12022","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31301/01456290.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1981.12022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31301","startPage":"529","endPage":"541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The importance of phase in signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1456290","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The importance of phase in signals","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1981","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456290/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1981","isJournal":true,"volume":"69","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1981","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The importance of phase in signals","sourcePdf":"01456290.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032226S","chronDate":"May  1981","isNumber":"31301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"1048","articleId":"1456290","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1456292,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

They obviously constitute an essential tool in expressing the laws of physics. Some of their structures, however (exterior algebra, exterior differential operators, and others), are not widely known or used. This article concentrates on the relevance of the \"exterior calculus\" to electromagnetics. It is shown that the association of differential forms with electromagnetic quantities is quite natural. The basic relations between these quantities, displayed in flow diagrams, make use of a single operator \"d\" (exterior differential) in place of the familiar curl, grad and div operators of vector calculus. Their covariance properties (behavior under change of variables) are discussed. These formulas in space-time have a strikingly concise and elegant expression. Furthermore, they are also invariant under any change of coordinates involving both space and time. Physical dimensions of the electromagnetic forms are such that only two units (coulomb and weber, or e and g) are needed. A few sample applications of the exterior calculus are discussed, mostly to familiarize the reader with the aspect of equations written in this manner. The transition from differential to integral formulas is uniformly performed by means of Stokes' theorem (concisely expressed in terms of forms). When integrations over moving domains are involved, the concepts of flow and Lie derivative come into play. The relation of the topology of a region to the existence of potentials valid in that region is illustrated by two examples: the magnetic field due to a steady electric current and the vector potential of the B-field due to a Dirac magnetic monopole. An extensive appendix reviews most results needed in the main text.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electromagnetics and differential forms","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1981.12048","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31302/01456316.pdf","startPage":"676","endPage":"696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1981.12048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31302","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1456316","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456316/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1981","displayDocTitle":"Electromagnetics and differential forms","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"69","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"June 1981","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electromagnetics and differential forms","sourcePdf":"01456316.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025622S","chronDate":"June  1981","isNumber":"31302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"162","articleId":"1456316","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1456317,"authors":[{"name":"L.J.

The design and reliable operation of satellite systems which provide the many applications in space and rely on the transmission of radio waves for communications and scientific purposes are dependent on the propagation characteristics of the transmission path. The presence of atmospheric gases, clouds, fog, precipitation, and turbulence cause uncontrolled variations in the signal characteristics which can result in a reduction of the quality and reliability of the transmitted information. Models and techniques used in the prediction of atmospheric effects as influenced by frequency, geography, elevation angle, and type of transmission are discussed. Recent data on performance characteristics obtained from direct measurements on satellite links operating to above 30 GHz are reviewed. Particular emphasis is placed on the effects of precipitation on the earth-space path, including rain attenuation, and rain and ice-particle depolarization. Sky noise, antenna gain degradation, scintillations, and bandwidth coherence are also discussed. The impact of the various propagation factors on communications system design criteria is presented. These criteria include link reliability, power margins, noise contributions, modulation and polarization factors, channel crosstalk, error-rate, and bandwidth limitations.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1981.12049","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31302/01456317.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1981.12049","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","startPage":"697","endPage":"727","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radio propagation for space communications systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1456317","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1981","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1981","displayDocTitle":"Radio propagation for space communications systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456317/","volume":"69","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1981","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio propagation for space communications systems","sourcePdf":"01456317.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043196S","chronDate":"June  1981","isNumber":"31302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"95","articleId":"1456317","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1456318,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Emphasis is placed on pseudonoise (PN) direct sequence systems. Pertinent features of the disturbed ionospheric propagation channel are described together with the characteristics of resulting satellite signal scintillations. Effects of frequency selective scintillations on PN spread-spectrum code correlation and tracking are illustrated in some detail. The design of the receiver PN code tracking loop is an important factor in determining the significance of these effects. Of the designs that have been investigated, a dedicated (non-time-shared) noncoherent code tracking loop appears to be least susceptible to losing code lock in the presence of frequency selective scintillation.

For dielectric media with periodic rough surfaces, an improved method is developed for calculating the reflected and transmitted powers.

A large number of design methods are currently in use. However, the evolution of these computer aids has occurred in an ad hoc manner. In most cases, computer programs have been written to solve specific problems as they have exist and no truly integrated computer-aided desisn (CAD) systems exist for the design of IC's. A structured approach both to circuit desisn and to circuit verification, as well as the development of integrated design systems, is necessary to produce cost-effective error-free VLSI circuits. This paper presents a review of the CAD techniques which have been used in the design of IC's, as well as a number of design methods to which the application of computer aids has proven most successful. The successful application of design-aids to VLSI circuits requites an evolution from these techniques and design methods.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1981.12160","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31306/01456428.pdf","startPage":"1189","endPage":"1199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1981.12160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer-aided design of VLSI circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1456428","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1981","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456428/","displayDocTitle":"Computer-aided design of VLSI circuits","volume":"69","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1981","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer-aided design of VLSI circuits","sourcePdf":"01456428.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096337S","chronDate":"Oct.  1981","isNumber":"31306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"20","articleId":"1456428","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":1456429,"authors":[{"name":"D.E.

Finally, the overall performance of the various transmultiplexer approaches are compared with each other by means of different criteria [1], such as stability under looped conditions, absolute value of the group delay, computational and control complexity, modularity, potential of intelligible crosstalk, absence of an additional analog frequency conversion, and the impact of out-of-band signaling For a more profound understanding of the individual digital trsnsmultiplexer approaches, the main chapter is preceded by an introductory discussion on analog and digital generation of single-sideband signals.

While many kinds of devices will benefit, the principal and first beneficiary will be bipolar transistors. The underlying central principle is the use of energy gap variations beside electric fields to control the forces acting on electrons and holes, separately and independently of each other. The resulting greater design freedom permits a re-optimization of doping levels and geometries, leading to higher speed devices. Microwave transistors with maximum oscillation frequencies above 100 GHz and digital switching transistors with switching times below 10 ps should become available. An inverted transistor strucure with a smaller collectors on top and a larger emitter on the bottom becomes possible, with speed advantages over the common \"emitter-up\" design. Double-heterostructure (DH) transistors with both wide-gap emitters and collectors offer additional advantages. They exhibit better performance under saturated operation. Their emitters and collectors may be interchanged by simply changing biasing conditions, greatly simplifying the architecture of bipolar IC's.

The growth and change in array antennas include increased emphasis on \"special-purpose\" array techniques such as conformal and printed circuit arrays, wide angle scanning arrays, techniques for limited sector coverage, and antennas with dramatically increased pattern control features such as low sidelobe, adaptively controlled patterns. These new topics have substantially replaced large radar arrays in the literature and constitute a major change in the technology. The paper presents a tutorial review of theoretical developments emphasizing techniques appropriate to finite arrays, but indicating parallel developments in infinite array theory, which has become the useful tool for analysis of large arrays. A brief review of the theory of ideal arrays is followed by a generalized formulation of array theory including mutual coupling effects, and is appropriate to finite or infinite arrays of arbitrary wire elements or apertures in the presence of a conducting ground screen. Some results of array tolerance theory are summarized from the literature and retained as reference throughout discussions of array component requirements and device tolerance for low sidelobe arrays. Examples from present technology include conformal and hemispherical coverage arrays, lightweight printed circuit arrays, systems for use with reflectors and lenses in limited sector coverage applications, and wide-band array techniques.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1982.12285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31311","startPage":"246","endPage":"291","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31311/01456553.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phased array theory and technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456553/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1982","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Phased array theory and technology","publicationDate":"March 1982","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"70","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phased array theory and technology","sourcePdf":"01456553.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143178S","chronDate":"March  1982","isNumber":"31311","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"152","articleId":"1456553","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1456581,"authors":[{"name":"Kung Chie Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Kung Chie Yeh","id":"37087261245"},{"name":"Chao-Han Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Chao-Han Liu","id":"37087260820"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2256"}],"articleNumber":"1456581","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1574},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1456581","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ionosphere","Geophysical measurements","Fluctuations","Frequency","Satellite broadcasting","Artificial satellites","Chaotic communication","Radar measurements","Phase measurement","Radar scattering"]}],"abstract":"The phenomenon of scintillation of radio waves propagating through the ionosphere is reviewed in this paper. The emphasis is on propagational aspects, including both theoretical and experimental results. The review opens with a discussion of the motivation for stochastic formulation of the problem. Based on measurements from in-situ, radar, and propagation experiments, ionospheric irregularities ate found to be characterized, in general, by a power-law spectrum. While earlier measurements indicated a spectral index of about 4, there is recent evidence showing that the index may vary with the strength of the irregularity and possibly a two-component spectrum may exist with different spectral indices for large and small structures. Several scintillation theories including the Phase Screen, Rytov, and Parabolic Equation Method (PEM) are discussed next. Statistical parameters of the signal such as the average signal, scintillation index, rms phase fluctuations, correlation functions, power spectra, distributions, etc., are investigated. Effects of multiple scattering are discussed. Experimental results concerning irregularity structures and signal statics are presented. These results are compared with theoretical predictions. The agreements are shown to be satisfactory in a large measure. Next, the temporal behavior of a transionospheric radio signal is studied in terms of a two-frequency mutual coherence function and the temporal moments. Results including numerical simulations are discussed. Finally, some future efforts in ionospheric scintillation studies in the areas of transionospheric communication and space- and geophysics are recommended.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31312","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1982.12313","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31312/01456581.pdf","startPage":"324","endPage":"360","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1982.12313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radio wave scintillations in the ionosphere","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1982","displayDocTitle":"Radio wave scintillations in the ionosphere","volume":"70","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1982","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456581/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1982","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio wave scintillations in the ionosphere","sourcePdf":"01456581.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.174725S","chronDate":"April  1982","isNumber":"31312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"67","articleId":"1456581","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1456599,"authors":[{"name":"K.E.

In addition, recent trends in the engineering literature indicate a growing interest in the use of silicon as a mechanical material with the ultimate goal of developing a broad range of inexpensive, batch-fabricated, high-performance sensors and transducers which are easily interfaced with the rapidly proliferating microprocessor. This review describes the advantages of employing silicon as a mechanical material, the relevant mechanical characteristics of silicon, and the processing techniques which are specific to micromechanical structures. Finally, the potentials of this new technology are illustrated by numerous detailed examples from the literature. It is clear that silicon will continue to be aggressively exploited in a wide variety of mechanical applications complementary to its traditional role as an electronic material. Furthermore, these multidisciplinary uses of silicon will significantly alter the way we think about all types of miniature mechanical devices and components.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1982.12331","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31313/01456599.pdf","startPage":"420","endPage":"457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1982.12331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Silicon as a mechanical material","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1456599","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456599/","displayDocTitle":"Silicon as a mechanical material","volume":"70","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1982","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Silicon as a mechanical material","sourcePdf":"01456599.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102661S","chronDate":"May  1982","isNumber":"31313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"2043","articleId":"1456599","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":1456601,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

Based on this model, a very simple program was written on a desk-top computer for the transient analysis of lossy trammission lines. Two examples are presented. The first example is an analysis of the step and pulse responses of a 600-m RG-8/U coaxial cable. The computed results show excellent agreement with measured data.

Lattice filters associated with stationary covariance sequences and their properties are discussed. The least squares prediction problem is defined for the given data case, and it is shown that many of the currently used lattice methods are actually approximations to the stationary least squares solution. The recently developed class of adaptive least squares lattice algorithms are described in detail, both in their unnormalized and normalized forms. The performance of the adaptive least squares lattice algorithm is compared to that of some gradient adaptive methods. Lattice forms for ARMA processes, for joint process estimation, and for the sliding-window covariance case are presented. The use of lattice structures for efficient factorization of covariance matrices and solution of Toeplitz sets of equations is briefly discussed.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1982.12407","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31316/01456675.pdf","startPage":"829","endPage":"867","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1982.12407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lattice filters for adaptive processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1982","displayDocTitle":"Lattice filters for adaptive processing","volume":"70","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456675/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1982","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lattice filters for adaptive processing","sourcePdf":"01456675.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121158S","chronDate":"Aug.  1982","isNumber":"31316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"278","articleId":"1456675","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1456692,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

The parameters of the hypothesized rational model are typically selected so that these relationships \"best represent\" a set of autocorrelation lag estimates computed from time series observations. One of the objectives of this paper will be that of establishing this fundamental approach to the generation of rational models. An examination of many popular contemporary spectral estimation methods reveals that the parameters of a hypothesized rational model are estimated upon using a \"minimal\" set of Yule-Walker equation evaluations. This results in an undesired parameter hypersensitivity and a subsequent decrease in estimation performance. To counteract this parameter hypersensitivity, the concept of using more than the minimal number of Yule-Walker equation evaluations is herein advocated. It is shown that by taking this overdetermined parametric evaluation approach, a reduction in data-induced model parameter hypersensitivity is obtained, and a corresponding improvement in modeling performance results. Moreover, upon adapting a singular value decomposition representation of an extended-order autocorrelation matrix estimate to this procedure, a desired model order determination method is obtained and a further significant improvement in modeling performance is achieved. This approach makes possible the generation of low-order high-quality rational spectral estimates from short data lengths.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31317/01456692.pdf","startPage":"907","endPage":"939","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1982.12424","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1982.12424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31317","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1456692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral estimation: An overdetermined rational model equation approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equations","Autocorrelation","Density functional theory","Radar signal processing","Array signal processing","Fourier transforms","Fourier series","Automatic programming","Singular value decomposition","Matrix decomposition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456692/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1982","displayDocTitle":"Spectral estimation: An overdetermined rational model equation approach","volume":"70","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1982","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral estimation: An overdetermined rational model equation approach","sourcePdf":"01456692.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054452S","chronDate":"Sept.  1982","isNumber":"31317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"378","articleId":"1456692","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1456693,"authors":[{"name":"E.T.

We conclude that: 1) \"Orthodox\" sampling theory methods are useful in problems where we have a known model (sampling distribution) for the properties of the noise, but no appreciable prior information about the quantities being estimated. 2) MAXENT is optimal in problems where we have prior information about multiplicities, but no noise. 3) The full Bayesian solution includes both of these as special cases and is needed in problems where we have both prior information and noise. 4) AR models are in one sense a special case of MAXENT, but in another sense they are ubiquitous in all spectral analysis problems with discrete time series. 5) Empirical methods such as Blackman-Tukey, which do not invoke even a likelihood function, are useful in the preliminary, exploratory phase of a problem where our knowledge is sufficient to permit intuitive judgments about how to organize a calculation (smoothing, decimation, windows, prewhitening, padding with zeroes, etc.) but insufficient to set up a quantitative model which would do the proper things for us automatically and optimally.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1982.12425","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31317/01456693.pdf","startPage":"939","endPage":"952","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1982.12425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the rationale of maximum-entropy methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1456693","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456693/","displayDocTitle":"On the rationale of maximum-entropy methods","volume":"70","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1982","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the rationale of maximum-entropy methods","sourcePdf":"01456693.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037284S","chronDate":"Sept.  1982","isNumber":"31317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"1003","articleId":"1456693","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":1456694,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Multichannel and multidimensional processes have covariance matrices of block Toeplitz form. In these cases and many other situations, one knows that the actual covariance matrix belongs to a particular subclass of covariance matrices. This paper discusses a method for estimating a covariance matrix of specified structure from vector samples of the random process. The theoretical foundation of the method is to assume that the random process is zero-mean multivariate Gaussian, and to find the maximum-likelihood covariance matrix that has the specified structure. An existence proof is given and the solution is interpreted in terms of a minimum-entropy principle. The necessary gradient conditions that must be satisfied by the maximum-likelihood solution are derived and unique and nonunique analytic solutions for some simple problems are presented. A major contribution of this paper is an iterative algorithm that solves the necessary gradient equations for moderate-sized problems with reasonable computational ease. Theoretical convergence properties of the basic algorithm are investigated and robust modifications discussed. In doing maximum-entropy spectral analysis of a sine wave in white noise from a single vector sample, this new estimation procedure causes no splitting of the spectral line in contrast to the Burg technique.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1982.12427","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31317/01456695.pdf","startPage":"963","endPage":"974","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1982.12427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of structured covariance matrices","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1982","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of structured covariance matrices","volume":"70","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456695/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1982","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of structured covariance matrices","sourcePdf":"01456695.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104752S","chronDate":"Sept.  1982","isNumber":"31317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"250","articleId":"1456695","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1456696,"authors":[{"name":"D.W.

A source for the improvement is an implied replacement of the usual estimated correlation matrix by a least squares approximation matrix having the lower rank M. A second, related cause for the improvement is an increase in the order of the prediction filter beyond conventional limits. Computationally, the recommended signal processing is the same as for the FBLP method, except that the vector of prediction coefficients is formed from a linear combination of the M principal eigenvectors of the estimated correlation matrix. Alternatively, singular value decomposition can be used in the implementation. In one special case, which we call the Kumaresan-Prony (KP) case, the new prediction coefficients can be calculated in a very simple way. Philosophically, the improvement can be considered to result from a preliminary estimation of the explainable, predictable components of the data, rather than attempting to explain all of the observed data by linear prediction.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1982.12428","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31317/01456696.pdf","startPage":"975","endPage":"989","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1982.12428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of frequencies of multiple sinusoids: Making linear prediction perform like maximum likelihood","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456696/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1982","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of frequencies of multiple sinusoids: Making linear prediction perform like maximum likelihood","volume":"70","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1982","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of frequencies of multiple sinusoids: Making linear prediction perform like maximum likelihood","sourcePdf":"01456696.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0867S","chronDate":"Sept.  1982","isNumber":"31317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"753","articleId":"1456696","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1456697,"authors":[{"name":"B.

In this paper we present a new method based on a \"local\" eigenexpansion to estimate the spectrum in terms of the solution of an integral equation. Computationally this method is equivalent to using the weishted average of a series of direct-spectrum estimates based on orthogonal data windows (discrete prolate spheroidal sequences) to treat both the bias and smoothing problems. Some of the attractive features of this estimate are: there are no arbitrary windows; it is a small sample theory; it is consistent; it provides an analysis-of-variance test for line components; and it has high resolution. We also show relations of this estimate to maximum-likelihood estimates, show that the estimation capacity of the estimate is high, and show applications to coherence and polyspectrum estimates.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456701/","volume":"70","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1982","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum estimation and harmonic analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum estimation and harmonic analysis","sourcePdf":"01456701.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166257S","chronDate":"Sept.  1982","isNumber":"31317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"2568","articleId":"1456701","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":1456702,"authors":[{"name":"R.D.

Outliers and other local perturbations are modeled by non-Gaussian additive noise, which is zero most of the time. Correspondingly, the lack of robustness of the conventional estimates of the spectrum manifest not only inflated variances but also damaging asymptotic biases. This paper discusses robust-resistant methods of spectrum estimation which do not suffer in this way. The main approach involves \"data cleaning\" by either one-sided or two-sided outlier interpolators based on autoregressive approximations. The autoregressive coefficients are themselves estimated robustly in an iterative loop along with the data-cleaning operation. The well-cleaned data are then used along with the autoregressive model to form smoothed spectral density estimates via prewhitening. Study of the so-called \"linear part\" of the nonlinear outlier interpolator algorithm shows that considerable bias reduction is realizable through use of the robust procedure. Some examples of applications of the robust methodology are presented. Special considerations for real-time processing and large data sets are discussed. Extensions of the method to cross-spectrum estimation, missing data, and irregularly spaced data problems are briefly mentioned.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust-resistant spectrum estimation","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1982.12434","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31317/01456702.pdf","startPage":"1097","endPage":"1115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1982.12434","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31317","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1456702","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456702/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1982","displayDocTitle":"Robust-resistant spectrum estimation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"70","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"Sept. 1982","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust-resistant spectrum estimation","sourcePdf":"01456702.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058776S","chronDate":"Sept.  1982","isNumber":"31317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"125","articleId":"1456702","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1456707,"authors":[{"name":"M.D. Flickner","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, IBM Research Center, San Jose, CA, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA"],"firstName":"M.D.","lastName":"Flickner","id":"37353212100"},{"name":"N.

A new logic design methodology called CSA theory is described here which overcomes many of these deficiencies. It is based on three primitive component types: connectors that perform wired-logic operations, switches representing controlled connectors, and attenuators representing resistive load devices. Four basic types of logic values are recognized: Boolean 0 and 1 values, unknown or indeterminate U values, and the high-impedance state Z. The number of logic values can be increased systematically to improve modeling accuracy using a concept of logical strength, which corresponds to current drive capability in analog circuits. It is shown that both the behavior and layout of most types of MOS logic circuits, including contact, gate, and nonclassical mixed circuits, can be treated in a uniform and rigorous manner using CSA network models with either four or seven logic values. The use of a digital charge-storage element called a well to represent sequential behavior is examined. CSA theory is applied to two VLSI design issues, inverter synthesis and fault simulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31318/01456714.pdf","startPage":"1140","endPage":"1151","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1982.12446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1982.12446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31318","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1456714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A unified switching theory with applications to VLSI design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Logic circuits","Connectors","Logic devices","Boolean functions","Switching circuits","Logic design","Switches","Attenuators","Analog circuits"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456714/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1982","displayDocTitle":"A unified switching theory with applications to VLSI design","volume":"70","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1982","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified switching theory with applications to VLSI design","sourcePdf":"01456714.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107125S","chronDate":"Oct.  1982","isNumber":"31318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"58","articleId":"1456714","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1456716,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The process speedup due to parallelism and the cost advantage due to the use of large numbers of identical VLSI parts make these new machines practical today.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1983.12527","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31321/01456795.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1983.12527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31321","startPage":"57","endPage":"65","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wire-routing machines\u2014New tools for VLSI physical design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1456795","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wire-routing machines\u2014New tools for VLSI physical design","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456795/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1983","isJournal":true,"volume":"71","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1983","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wire-routing machines\u2014New tools for VLSI physical design","sourcePdf":"01456795.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038977S","chronDate":"Jan.  1983","isNumber":"31321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"17","articleId":"1456795","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1456797,"authors":[{"name":"S.G.

When CW irradiation is used, the sidelobes in the pointspread function are inherently high and tend to limit the dynamic range of the reconstructed images. The point-spread function of a system using CW irradiation and an aperture that completely surrounds the object has a central lobe of width of \u03bb/5, but the first sidelobe is only 8 dB below the central peak. The limitation due to the high sidelobes can be partially overcome by using wide-band signals or bistatic diversity. One of the steps in reconstructing a coherent Doppler tomogram is to perform a two-dimensional Fourier transform. The ordinary two-dimensional discrete Fourier transform (DFT) produces points in the transform space on a Cartesian raster. In coherent Doppler tomography (CDT), however, the data are sampled on a polar raster. To diminish the computational burden associated with converting to the Cartesian raster and interpolating, we have developed an alternative algorithm which requires no interpolation and is based on interpreting the two-dimensional Fourier transform as a one-dimensional circular convolution integral. The quality of the images computed in this fashion compares favorably with that for the old method and the computational burden is greatly reduced.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1983.12563","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31322/01456831.pdf","startPage":"254","endPage":"261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1983.12563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coherent Doppler tomography for microwave imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456831/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1983","displayDocTitle":"Coherent Doppler tomography for microwave imaging","volume":"71","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1983","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent Doppler tomography for microwave imaging","sourcePdf":"01456831.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058481S","chronDate":"Feb.  1983","isNumber":"31322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"62","articleId":"1456831","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1456865,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

In this tutorial paper, the inversion formula for the case of two-dimensional (2-D) reconstruction from line integrals is manipulated into a number of different forms, each of which may be discretized to obtain different algorithms for reconstruction from sampled data. For the convolution-backprojection algorithm and the direct Fourier algorithm the emphasis is placed on understanding the relationship between the discrete operations specified by the algorithm and the functional operations expressed by the inversion formula. The performance of the Fourier algorithm may be improved, with negligible extra computation, by interleaving two polar sampling grids in Fourier space. The convolution-backprojection formulas are adapted for the fan-beam geometry, and other reconstruction methods are summarized, including the rho-filtered layergram method, and methods involving expansions in angular harmonics. A standard mathematical process leads to a known formula for iterative reconstruction from projections at a finite number of angles. A new iterative reconstruction algorithm is obtained from this formula by introducing one-dimensional (1-D) and 2-D interpolating functions, applied to sampled projections and images, respectively. These interpolating functions are derived by the same Fourier approach which aids in the development and understanding of the more conventional transform methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456865/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1983","publicationDate":"March 1983","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","volume":"71","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction algorithms: Transform methods","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction algorithms: Transform methods","sourcePdf":"01456865.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085066S","chronDate":"March  1983","isNumber":"31323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"264","articleId":"1456865","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":1456866,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Great research efforts have gone into them since but many questions still wait to be answered. These methods, synonymously known as algebraic methods, iterative algorithms, or optimization theory techniques, are based on the discretization of the image domain prior to any mathematical analysis and thus are rooted in a completely different branch of mathematics than the transform methods which are discussed in this issue by Lewitt [51]. How is the model set up? What is the methodology of the approach? Where does mathematical optimization theory enter? What do these reconstruction algorithms look like? How are quadratic optimization, entropy optimization, and Bayesian analysis used in image reconstruction? Finally, why study series expansion methods if transform methods are so much faster? These are some of the questions that are answered in this paper.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite series-expansion reconstruction methods","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1983.12598","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31323/01456866.pdf","startPage":"409","endPage":"419","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1983.12598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31323","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1456866","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456866/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1983","displayDocTitle":"Finite series-expansion reconstruction methods","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"71","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"March 1983","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite series-expansion reconstruction methods","sourcePdf":"01456866.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068581S","chronDate":"March  1983","isNumber":"31323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"310","articleId":"1456866","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1456887,"authors":[{"name":"C.H.

The attraction of the long-wavelength region is the availability of the ultimately low-loss and wide-band features of the silica fiber, where minimum loss is 0.27 dB/km at a wavelength of 1.3 \u00b5m and 0.16 dB/km at 1.55 \u00b5m. The single-mode fiber has found its first significant applications in long-wavelength systems. The specific characteristics of lightwave components are discussed with focus on physical fundamentals. The practical performance of fibers and lightwave devices is surveyed. The dynamic properties of long-wavelength laser diodes are discussed in relation to fiber characteristics. The noise characteristics of long-wavelength detectors are considered for the purpose of specifying the repeater spacing. Some system studies are reviewed, for example, 1.3-\u00b5m-wavelength lightwave systems, which have demonstrated bandwidth-distance products of about 40 GHz \u010b km. Various approaches to extend the capacity of long-wavelength lightwave transmission are given. In the future, the 1.5-\u00b5m wavelength system could operate at the lowest loss wavelength region extending from 1.5 to 1.65 \u00b5m. Much higher performance, for example, bandwidth-distance products of 185 GHz \u010b km, achieved by further continuation of research and development on lightwave sources as well as fibers. Because of the author's familiarity with work in Japan, that work is emphasized and most frequently cited.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1983.12659","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31326/01456927.pdf","startPage":"692","endPage":"721","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1983.12659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Long-wavelength optical fiber communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456927/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1983","displayDocTitle":"Long-wavelength optical fiber communication","volume":"71","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1983","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long-wavelength optical fiber communication","sourcePdf":"01456927.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017373S","chronDate":"June  1983","isNumber":"31326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"36","articleId":"1456927","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1456937,"authors":[{"name":"B.B.

A computer program was written which drove the Cart through cluttered spaces, gaining its knowledge of the world entirely from images broadcast by an on-board TV system. The CMU Rover is a more capable, and neatly operational, robot being built to develop and extend the Stanford work and to explore new directions. The Cart used several kinds of stereopsis to locate objects around it in three dimensions and to deduce its own motion. It planned an obstacle-avoiding path to a desired destination on the basis of a model built with this information. The plan changed as the Cart perceived new obstacles on its journey. The system was reliable for short runs, but slow. The Cart moved 1 m every 10 to 15 min, in lurches. After rolling a meter it stopped, took some pictures, and thought about them for a long time. Then it planned a new path, executed a little of it, and paused again. It successfully drove the Cart through several 20-m courses (each taking about 5 h) complex enough to necessitate three or four avoiding swerves; it failed in other trials in revealing ways. The Rover system has been designed with maximum mechanical and control system flexibility to support a wide range of research in perception and control. It features an omnidirectional steering system, a dozen on-board processors for essential real-time tasks, and a large remote computer to be helped by a high-speed digitizing/data playback unit and a high-performance array processor. Distributed high-level control software similar in organization to the Hearsay II speech-understanding system and the beginnings of a vision library are being readied. By analogy with the evolution of natural intelligence, we believe that incrementally solving the control and perception problems of an autonomous mobile mechanism is one of the best ways of arriving at general artificial intelligence.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456952/","volume":"71","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1983","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Stanford Cart and the CMU Rover","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Stanford Cart and the CMU Rover","sourcePdf":"01456952.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031132S","chronDate":"July  1983","isNumber":"31327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"221","articleId":"1456952","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1456954,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This paper shows that spotlight-mode SAR can be interpreted as a tomographic reeonstrution problem and analyzed using the projection-slice theorem from computer-aided tomograpy (CAT). The signal recorded at each SAR transmission point is modeled as a portion of the Fourier transform of a central projection of the imaged ground area. Reconstruction of a SAR image may then be accomplished using algorithms from CAT. This model permits a simple understanding of SAR imaging, not based on Doppler shifts. Resolution, sampling rates, waveform curvature, the Doppler effect, and other issues are also discussed within the context of this interpretation of SAR.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1983.12698","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31328/01456966.pdf","startPage":"917","endPage":"925","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1983.12698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A tomographic formulation of spotlight-mode synthetic aperture radar","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456966/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1983","displayDocTitle":"A tomographic formulation of spotlight-mode synthetic aperture radar","volume":"71","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1983","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A tomographic formulation of spotlight-mode synthetic aperture radar","sourcePdf":"01456966.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054415S","chronDate":"Aug.  1983","isNumber":"31328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"458","articleId":"1456966","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1456967,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

At frequencies above about 5 GHz, rain, snow, or ice crystals in high altitudes cause various degrading effects on the performance of communication links. The attenuation of the transmitted signals is a well-known example of such effects. Because of the demand for more communication channels, operating frequencies of both terrestrial and earth--scace communication systems become increasingly higher, and the communication technology becomes more and more sophisticated with the use of digital techniques, or the use of both orthogonaly polarized channels. These have given rise to the need of acquiring more detailed knowledge of interactions between hydrometeors and waves than is necessary for the calculation of attenuation. To obtain such knowledge, we have to know the detailed microphysical properties of hydrometeors, such as shape, size distributions, or the motion of hydrometeors while they are falling. These properties, some obtained previously by meteorolgists and some obtaianed recently by radio engineers to meet the requirements of present radio problems, are reviewed first. Various methods of calculations, and the detailed knowledge obtained from calculations of the single scattering properties of hydrometeors, whose sizes are generally comparable to wavelength, are then reviewed. With the information of these scattering properties, various propagation phenomena are discussed from a theoretical point of view. Specific subjects treated include attenuation, cross polarization due to rain or ice crystals in high altitudes, the methods of depolarization cancellation, rain scattering other then forward and backward which is necessary in the estimation of rain scatter interference between two communication links operating at the same frequency, various multiple or incoherent scattering effects on copolar and cross-polar signals, pulse shape, channel transfer characteristics, etc. The aim of this review is to provide fundamental background informations on the interactions between hydrometeors and radio waves, and hence the more practical investigations, such as long-term statistics of attenuation, are beyond the scope of this review.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31329/01456992.pdf","startPage":"1029","endPage":"1078","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1983.12724","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1983.12724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31329","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1456992","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electromagnetic wave propagation and scattering in rain and other hydrometeors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic propagation","Electromagnetic scattering","Rain","Attenuation","Ice","Crystals","Polarization","Shape","Frequency estimation","Microwave theory and techniques"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1456992/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1983","displayDocTitle":"Electromagnetic wave propagation and scattering in rain and other hydrometeors","volume":"71","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1983","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electromagnetic wave propagation and scattering in rain and other hydrometeors","sourcePdf":"01456992.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136566S","chronDate":"Sept.  1983","isNumber":"31329","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"320","articleId":"1456992","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":1456996,"authors":[{"name":"J.D.

Some attempt is made to place this work in historical relation to similar efforts in radio-wave propagation through the ionosphere and light propagation through the atmosphere. It is emphasized that internal waves as a random medium possess several new features unfamiliar to those dealing with homogeneous isotropic turbulence. The effect of a background deterministic wave-speed variation (the ocean sound channel) is central to the theoretical treatment, which is based on a path-integral solution of the parabolic wave equation. A distinction is made between two sections of the saturated region and some emphasis is placed on the region of partial saturation. Comparison with experiment is discussed with examples from the two-point mutual coherence function of time, frequency, and vertical separation; the intensity correlation in time, frequency, and vertical separation; the spectra of phase and log intensity, pulse propagation, and the higher moments of intensity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457032/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1983","volume":"71","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1983","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Wave propagation through random media: Contributions from ocean acoustics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wave propagation through random media: Contributions from ocean acoustics","sourcePdf":"01457032.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090746S","chronDate":"Nov.  1983","isNumber":"31331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"111","articleId":"1457032","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1457033,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.

A synthesis array measures the Fourier transform of the observed brightness distribution by cross-correlating the signals from antennas separated by distances up to tens of kilometers. The antennas must be equipped with low-noise receiving systems and connected together by phase-stable transmission links. Wide-bandwidth digital correlators are used to perform the cross correlation. The data-reduction algorithms and computing system play a critical role in determining the quality of the images produced by the array. The Very Large Array (VLA) synthesis telescope, recently constructed in New Mexico, consists of twenty-seven 25-m-diameter antennas arranged in a Y-shaped array. Each arm of the Y is approximately 21 km long and the antetmas can be moved to various positions on the arms by a rail-mounted transporter. The antennas are equipped with cryogenically cooled receiving systems and are interconnected by low-loss, TE\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">01</inf>\n-mode, large-diameter waveguide. The cross-correlation products for each of the 351 pair combinations of antennas are measured for 4 IF signals by a 50-MHz bandwidth digital correlator. In this paper we discuss the design of synthesis arrays in general, and describe the design and performance of the VLA in particular, under the seven headings: array geometry design, sensitivity considerations, phase stability requirements, signal transmission system, delay and correlator system, control system, and data-reduction requirments. In each section, we review the underlying instrumental requirements and provide details of how the VLA was designed to meet them. Recently developed data-reduction algorithms provide effective ways of correcting synthesis images for the effects of missing Fourier components and instrumental and atmospheric amplitude and phase errors. The power of these algorithms is demonstrated using actual VLA images.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The very large array: Design and performance of a modern synthesis radio telescope","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1983.12765","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31331/01457033.pdf","startPage":"1295","endPage":"1320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1983.12765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31331","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1457033","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457033/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1983","displayDocTitle":"The very large array: Design and performance of a modern synthesis radio telescope","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"71","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"Nov. 1983","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The very large array: Design and performance of a modern synthesis radio telescope","sourcePdf":"01457033.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166657S","chronDate":"Nov.  1983","isNumber":"31331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"203","articleId":"1457033","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1457047,"authors":[{"name":"A.L.

The two concepts together describe all of the peer-to-peer interactions that take place in the OSI environment. The national and international organizations concerned with OSI have applied these concepts successfully in the development of OSI service and protocol standards.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31332/01457047.pdf","startPage":"1365","endPage":"1371","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1983.12779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1983.12779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Connections and connectionless data transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457047/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1983","displayDocTitle":"Connections and connectionless data transmission","publicationDate":"Dec. 1983","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","isJournal":true,"volume":"71","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Connections and connectionless data transmission","sourcePdf":"01457047.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019395S","chronDate":"Dec.  1983","isNumber":"31332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"4","articleId":"1457047","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1457066,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Based on similar concepts, we develop a new theory for low-sensitivity discrete-time filter structures. The mathematical setup for the development is the bounded-real property of transfer functions and matrices. Starting from this property, we derive procedures for the synthesis of any stable digital filter transfer function by means of a low-sensitivity structure. Most of the structures generated by this approach are interconnections of a basic building block called digital \"two-pair,\" and each two-pair is characterized by a lossless bounded-real (LBR) transfer matrix. The theory and synthesis procedures also cover special cases such as wave digital filters, which are derived from continuous-time networks, and digital lattice structures, which are closely related to unit elements of distributed network theory.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1984.12878","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31336/01457146.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1984.12878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31336","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","startPage":"404","endPage":"423","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1984","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Low passband sensitivity digital filters: A generalized viewpoint and synthesis procedures","volume":"72","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457146/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1984","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low passband sensitivity digital filters: A generalized viewpoint and synthesis procedures","sourcePdf":"01457146.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041719S","chronDate":"April  1984","isNumber":"31336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"116","articleId":"1457146","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1457152,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The main focus is on design optimization for speed and device area and on meeting the on-chip load drive requirements using one- and two-dimensional expansion techniques. Detailed comparisons are made between the effectiveness of the various design options in their ability to yield a specific performance within speed and/or area constraints while driving on-chip loads with and without geometrical constraints. These comparisons result in a number of design curves that cover the range of full CMOS custom design, for which two-dimensional scaling can be optimally utilized, to those cases involving semi-custom and gate-array designs for which geometric constraints exist (fixed height cells or fixed device sizes). A figure of merit is defined that relates speed and area to each specific circuit implementation, indicating that it can be used to make an effective comparison between overall performance and design option. It is finally suggested that a chip layout approach can be adopted that is useful for implementing any of the design options discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31338/01457184.pdf","startPage":"670","endPage":"689","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1984.12916","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1984.12916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31338","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1457184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of device area and overall delay for CMOS VLSI designs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design optimization","Very large scale integration","Design automation","Timing","Delay effects","Integrated circuit interconnections","Logic circuits","Analytical models","Circuit simulation","Silicides"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457184/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1984","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of device area and overall delay for CMOS VLSI designs","volume":"72","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1984","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of device area and overall delay for CMOS VLSI designs","sourcePdf":"01457184.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052768S","chronDate":"June  1984","isNumber":"31338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"16","articleId":"1457184","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1457205,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

Next is a discussion of communication, interconnection, and input-output problems of digital electronic and optical computers at the gate, chip, and processor level. A particular architecture for implementing general sequential optical logic systems including digital optical processors is described. This architecture avoids some of the interconnection problems of electronic integrated circuits and VLSI systems, and offers the potential of non von Neumann parallel digital processors.

The operational principles of the converter are summarized and a performance analysis presented. The analysis indicates that with currently attainable components, conversion in the 4- to 6-bit range at rates from 1 to 3 GS/s is feasible. Experimental results for several converters are summarized, including a description of beatfrequency tests for analog signals with frequency content up to 500 MHz that indicate the analog bandwidth capabilities of this device. The electrooptical technology is compared to competing high-speed A/D technologies in Si, GaAs, and superconducting materials and the relative merits analyzed. It is found that the electrooptic approach eliminates some of the fundamental and severe problems of conventional converters (e.g., sampling pickup and large numbers of comparators). Finally, application of this converter to wide-band signal-processing problems is described. It is noted that there are numerous applications where a moderate number of bits at a high (gigahertz) sampling rate is attractive.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1984.12940","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31339/01457208.pdf","startPage":"802","endPage":"819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1984.12940","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1984","displayDocTitle":"Wide-band electrooptic guided-wave analog-to-digital converters","volume":"72","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"July 1984","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457208/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide-band electrooptic guided-wave analog-to-digital converters","sourcePdf":"01457208.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051487S","chronDate":"July  1984","isNumber":"31339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"63","articleId":"1457208","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":1457211,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

This paper investigates the possibility of applying optical and electrooptical technologies to such interconnection problems. The origins of the communication crisis are discussed. Those aspects of electrooptic technology that are applicable to the generation, routing, and detection of light at the level of chips and boards are reviewed. Algorithmic implications of interconnections are discussed, with emphasis on the definition of a hierarchy of interconnection problems from the signal-processing area having an increasing level of complexity. One potential application of optical interconnections is to the problem of clock distribution, for which a single signal must be routed to many parts of a chip or board. More complex is the problem of supplying data interconnections via optical technology.

Tremendous progress has been made on several promising parallel architectures for scientific computations, including a variety of digital filters, fast Fourier transform (FFT) processors, data-flow processors, systolic arrays, and wavefront arrays. This paper describes these computing networks in terms of signal-flow graphs (SFG) or data-flow graphs (DFG), and proposes a methodology of converting SFG computing networks into synchronous systolic arrays or data-driven wavefront arrays. Both one- and two-dimensional arrays are discussed theoretically, as well as with illustrative examples. A wavefront-oriented programming language, which describes the (parallel) data flow in systolic/wavefront-type arrays, is presented. The structural property of parallel recursive algorithms points to the feasibility of a Hierarchical Iterative Flow-Graph Design (HIFD) of VLSI Array Processors.

These fiber structures can be used to perform various high-speed time-domain and frequency-domain functions such as matrix operations and frequency filtering. In this paper we mainly consider systems in which the signals (optical intensities) and coupling coefficients are nonnegative quantities; these systems fit well in the theory of positive systems. We use this theory to conclude, for example, that for such systems the pole of the system transfer function with the largest magnitude is simple and positive-valued (in the Z-plane), and that the magnitude of the frequency response can nowhere exceed its value at the origin. We also discuss the effects of various noise phenomena on the performance of fiber-optic signal processors, particularly considering the effects of laser source phase fluctuations. Experimental results are presented showing that the dynamic range of the fiber systems, discussed in this paper, is limited, not by the laser source intensity noise or shot noise, but by the laser phase-induced intensity noise. Mathematical analyses of lattice structures as well as additional applications are also presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fiber-optic lattice signal processing","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1984.12948","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31339/01457216.pdf","startPage":"909","endPage":"930","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1984.12948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31339","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1457216","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457216/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1984","displayDocTitle":"Fiber-optic lattice signal processing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"72","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"July 1984","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fiber-optic lattice signal processing","sourcePdf":"01457216.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046757S","chronDate":"July  1984","isNumber":"31339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"139","articleId":"1457216","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":1457227,"authors":[{"name":"R.

A new sequence of symmetric polynomials of descending degrees is defined for the characteristic polynomial and the number of zeros inside and outside the unit circle is shown to be related to a certain sign variation pattern of the polynomials in the sequence. A stability table based on this sequence is presented to obtain the sought distribution of zeros. The new table is close in appearance, size, and number of arithmetic operations to the Routh table used for continuous-time system polynomials. By comparison with the table of Jury, based on the theory of Marden, Cohn, and Schur, the new table involves about half the number of entries and a corresponding significant saving in computations. The study includes a detailed consideration of all possible cases of singular conditions so that the complete information on the number of zeros inside, outside, and on the unit circle is always obtained (including some additional information on possible reciprocal pairs of zeros). Necessary and sufficient conditions for a polynomial to have all its zeros inside the unit circle are obtained as a special outcome. Other additional necessary conditions, that are useful to shorten procedures when the table is used only for testing the stability of the system, are also given.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear systems","Polynomials","Stability","Discrete time systems","Difference equations","Arithmetic","Sufficient conditions","System testing","Transfer functions"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PROC.1984.12993","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31341/01457261.pdf","startPage":"1131","endPage":"1142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1984.12993","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zero location with respect to the unit circle of discrete-time linear system polynomials","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1457261","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Zero location with respect to the unit circle of discrete-time linear system polynomials","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457261/","volume":"72","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1984","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1984","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero location with respect to the unit circle of discrete-time linear system polynomials","sourcePdf":"01457261.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02487S","chronDate":"Sept.  1984","isNumber":"31341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"123","articleId":"1457261","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1457262,"authors":[{"name":"S.W.

The explorationist has used data from seismic and other sources to derive an indirect description of a potential reservoir. Key to his success has been the use of forward-modeling methods to aid him in relating what he sees in the seismic data to what he expects to see, based on his hypothesized geologic model These forward-modeling methods have developed from simple ray-tracing procedures that determine travel time, to more sophisticated methods that model the total wavefield. These methods include extensions of ray techniques, along with propagator and finite-difference methods. The formation of subsurface images from the seismic data has traditionally involved the use of inversion principles. The operations of deconvolution and migration are inverse methods that aid in the production of enhanced images of the subsurface. In recent years, the development of more direct methods of inversion has been initiated, based on scattering theory. These methods seek to estimate the acoustic or elastic parameters of the earth for ever more general model assumptions. Good progress has already been made using the assumption that the processed seismic data emulate the response of a horizontally stratified earth to a plane-wave excitation. Research is continuing to generalize the assumptions to include point-source excitation and a general scattering model of the subsurface.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1984.13025","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31342/01457293.pdf","startPage":"1385","endPage":"1393","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1984.13025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Seismic modeling and inversion","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457293/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1984","displayDocTitle":"Seismic modeling and inversion","volume":"72","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"Oct. 1984","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Seismic modeling and inversion","sourcePdf":"01457293.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046242S","chronDate":"Oct.  1984","isNumber":"31342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"8","articleId":"1457293","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1457294,"authors":[{"name":"D.G.

A seismic signal may be modeled as a convolutional model with the wavelet as one component. The wavelet propagated by the seismic energy source is complicated by transmission and recording filters. Some filters in the system can be deterministically defined while others are more conjectural. The estimation of the wavelet is useful in two major ways. Borehole measurements are used to model the surface seismograms. The wavelet used in the model needs to match that of the seismogram to correlate the two measurements. Conversely, the estimated wavelet can be used to design inverse filters which make the seismogram approach the borehole measures. Some well-known methods for estimation of the wavelet are based on assumptions about the wavelet or the earth reflectivity. Examples of the methods indicate success on some data even though each makes different assumptions. The methods serve to point out basic problems in reliably estimating the wavelet from the seismogram. Basic problems include noise, band-limiting, nonstationarity, uncertain theoretical models, assumption failure, and widely diverse geological sequences of the earth. Quality control or evaluation of the performance of an estimation algorithm is a nontrivial problem. The estimation of the wavelet from a seismic recording remains an area of challenging research and importance in exploration for hydrocarbons.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet estimation","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1984.13026","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31342/01457294.pdf","startPage":"1394","endPage":"1402","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1984.13026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1457294","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457294/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1984","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet estimation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"72","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"Oct. 1984","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet estimation","sourcePdf":"01457294.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045642S","chronDate":"Oct.  1984","isNumber":"31342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"31","articleId":"1457294","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1457295,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the use of the bispectrum in order to obviate the minimum-phase requirement.

This system utilizes TDMA digital communication in the trunk transmission route of the public communication network, which includes interregional-center routes and main-island-to-remoteisland routes. Small transportable earth stations enable easy access to the public communication network from any place in Japan. The adoption of the 30/20-GHz band enables use of a compact on-board antenna that has a shaped beam that effectively covers the main islands of Japan. It also enables the use of high-performance, compact antennas at the earth stations. These antennas can easily be installed on the roof of telephone offices or set on motor vehicles. One apparent disadvantage of using the 30/20-GHz band is rain attenuation. However, NTT has realized a commercial system that is affected very little by rain attenuation. This was accomplished by utilizing high-performance radio equipment and by concentrating on appropriate system design. Adoption of the 30/20-GHz band is quite significant because the wide bandwidth available enables construction of high-capacity economical transmission systems. It also enables use of small antennas, which allow construction of high-speed digital direct-to-user transmission systems using small earth stations. These expand the application of the domestic satellite communication system to even small service areas. Therefore, NTT considers satellite communication to be of primary importance for its proposed digital communication network, and has begun research on a high-capacity, economical, multibeam communication satellite system using the 30/20-GHz band. This paper describes the 30/20-GHz band radio technology, digital communication technology utilizing high-speed TDMA, and operational technology in the public communication network.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1984.13060","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31343/01457328.pdf","startPage":"1637","endPage":"1644","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1984.13060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"30/20-GHz domestic satellite communication system in the public communication network of Japan: Design and operation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1457328","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457328/","displayDocTitle":"30/20-GHz domestic satellite communication system in the public communication network of Japan: Design and operation","volume":"72","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1984","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"30/20-GHz domestic satellite communication system in the public communication network of Japan: Design and operation","sourcePdf":"01457328.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020954S","chronDate":"Nov.  1984","isNumber":"31343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"2","articleId":"1457328","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1457341,"authors":[{"name":"B.K.P.

Very recently, highly accurate millimeter-wave (5- to 1/2-mm) data on complex dielectric permittivity and loss tangent have become available to engineers for a variety of materials such as common ceramics, semiconductors, crystalline, and glass materials. One quasi-optical measurement method has proved to be most accurate and reproducible, namely, dispersive Fourier transform spectroscopy (DFTS) applied to a polarizing interferometer. The openresonator method and the Mach-Zehnder-IMPATT spectrometer will also be described and compared. The fact that the dielectric loss increases with frequency in the millimeter, unlike the microwave, is an important feature of these data. Reliable measurements also reveal that the methods of preparation of nominally identical specimens can change the dielectric losses by a factor of three.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457382/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1985","publicationDate":"Jan. 1985","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","volume":"73","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Millimeter-wave dielectric measurement of materials","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimeter-wave dielectric measurement of materials","sourcePdf":"01457382.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056028S","chronDate":"Jan.  1985","isNumber":"31345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"100","articleId":"1457382","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1457400,"authors":[{"name":"M.I.

Effects such as sea-surface roughness and horizontal inhomogeneity are also addressed. The models have been compared with extensive measurements in a variety of geographic locations. Worldwide radio refractivity climatologies have been compiled. A propagation assessment system, called the \"Integrated Refractive Effects Prediction System\" (IREPS), has been developed and successfully tested. It uses a small computer with interactive graphic displays and provides the user with performance assessment of communications and radar equipment based on prevailing atmospheric conditions. Environmental inputs into the system consist of surface measurements and profiles of atmospheric refractivity either calculated from radiosonde balloon data or measured by microwave refractometers.

Robust schemes are useful in situations where imprecise a priori knowledge of input characteristics makes the sensitivity of performance to deviations from assumed conditions an important factor in the design of good signal processing schemes. In this survey we discuss the minimax approach for the design of robust methods for signal processing. This has proven to be a very useful approach because it leads to constructive procedures for designing robust schemes. Our emphasis is on the contributions which have been made in robust signal processing, although key results of other robust statistical procedures are also considered. Most of the results we survey have been obtained in the past fifteen years, although some interesting earlier ideas for minimax signal processing are also mentioned. This survey is organized into five main parts, which deal separately with robust linear filters for signal estimation, robust linear filters for signal detection and related applications, nonlinear methods for robust signal detection, nonlinear methods for robust estimation, and robust data quantization. The interrelationships among many of these results are also discussed in the survey.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust techniques for signal processing: A survey","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1985.13167","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31347/01457435.pdf","startPage":"433","endPage":"481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1985.13167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31347","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1457435","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457435/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1985","displayDocTitle":"Robust techniques for signal processing: A survey","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"73","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"March 1985","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust techniques for signal processing: A survey","sourcePdf":"01457435.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166554S","chronDate":"March  1985","isNumber":"31347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"541","articleId":"1457435","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1457450,"authors":[{"name":"E.

A time-varying image, which is a function of three independent variables, must be sampled in at least two dimensions for transmission over a one-dimensional analog communication channel, and in three dimensions for digital processing and transmission. At the receiver, the sampled image must be interpolated to reconstruct a continuous function of space and time. In imagery destined for human viewing, the visual system forms an integral part of the reconstruction process. This paper presents an overview of the theory of sampling and reconstruction of multidimensional signals. The concept of sampling structures based on lattices is introduced. The important problem of conversion between different sampling structures is also treated. This theory is then applied to the sampling of time-varying imagery, including the role of the camera and display apertures, and the human visual system. Finally, a class of nonlinear interpolation algorithms which adapt to the motion in the scene is presented.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1985.13182","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31348/01457450.pdf","startPage":"502","endPage":"522","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1985.13182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The sampling and reconstruction of time-varying imagery with application in video systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1457450","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457450/","displayDocTitle":"The sampling and reconstruction of time-varying imagery with application in video systems","volume":"73","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1985","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The sampling and reconstruction of time-varying imagery with application in video systems","sourcePdf":"01457450.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0615S","chronDate":"April  1985","isNumber":"31348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"216","articleId":"1457450","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1457451,"authors":[{"name":"H.G.

The goal of image coding is to reduce this number, as much as possible, and reconstruct a faithful duplicate of the original picture. Early efforts in image coding, solely guided by information theory, led to a plethora of methods. The compression ratio, starting at 1 with the first digital picture in the early 1960s, reached a saturation level around 10:1 a couple of years ago. This certainly does not mean that the upper bound given by the entropy of the source has also been reached. First, this entropy is not known and depends heavily on the model used for the source, i.e., the digital image. Second, the information theory does not take into account what the human eye sees and how it sees. Recent progress in the study of the brain mechanism of vision has opened new vistas in picture coding. Directional sensitivity of the neurones in the visual pathway combined with the separate processing of contours and textures has led to a new class of coding methods capable of achieving compression ratios as high as 70:1. Image quality, of course, remains as an important problem to be investigated. This class of methods, that we call second generation, is the subject of this paper. Two groups can be formed in this class: methods using local operators and combining their output in a suitable way and methods using contour-texture descriptions. Four methods, two in each class, are described in detail. They are applied to the same set of original pictures to allow a fair comparison of the quality in the decoded pictures. If more effort is devoted to this subject, a compression ratio of 100:1 is within reach.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1985.13184","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31348/01457452.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1985.13184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31348","startPage":"549","endPage":"574","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Second-generation image-coding techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1457452","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Second-generation image-coding techniques","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457452/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1985","isJournal":true,"volume":"73","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1985","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Second-generation image-coding techniques","sourcePdf":"01457452.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044493S","chronDate":"April  1985","isNumber":"31348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"465","articleId":"1457452","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1457454,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The paper discusses the relationship of possible HDTV studio standards to these other channels and attempts to quantify, the magnitude of the problems of achieving compatibility and \"transparency.\" The main question of compatibility is identified as the need to solve the problem of using the same studio source as a signal for 60- as well as 50-Hz transmissions. \"Transparency\" can be achieved in a compatible way by adding bandwidth to carry the higher definition. However, if sophisticated bandwidth reduction techniques using picture storage in the receiver are to be used to achieve optimum spectrum usage a new starting point of standardization for transmission is required.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31348/01457457.pdf","startPage":"638","endPage":"645","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31348","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1985.13189","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1985.13189","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1457457","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["HDTV","Power cables","Cable TV","Bandwidth","TV broadcasting","Multimedia communication","Consumer electronics","Production","Satellite broadcasting","Computer displays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457457/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1985","displayDocTitle":"The evolution towards high-definition television","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"April 1985","volume":"73","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The evolution towards high-definition television","sourcePdf":"01457457.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041228S","chronDate":"April  1985","isNumber":"31348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"7","articleId":"1457457","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1457458,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The provisional HDTV system proposed by NHK based on the result of many studies and the performances of the system are described. Early in 1984, the MUSE system has been developed by NHK and the desirable HDTV information can be compressed with 8 MHz and packed with this system. Thanks to the development of the MUSE system, there is the potential of HDTV broadcasting via satellite and early introduction of HDTV into package media such as video discs and videotapes. The NHK's HDTV system was designed to match many other applications. Many kinds of HDTV equipment have been developed in Japan and HDTV is approached and studied in the relation to various aspects such as electrocinematography, printing, and medicine. NHK has been working on the development of the entire broadcasting system of HDTV to unite the whole world into one \"television community\" in the coming generation by a worldwide single standard. Video engineers all over the world should be aware of the importance of every possible effort toward the establishment of a global HDTV system.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1985.13190","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31348/01457458.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1985.13190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31348","startPage":"646","endPage":"655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-definition television systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1457458","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-definition television systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457458/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1985","isJournal":true,"volume":"73","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1985","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-definition television systems","sourcePdf":"01457458.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033468S","chronDate":"April  1985","isNumber":"31348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"32","articleId":"1457458","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1457486,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Theory and algorithms that are associated with these approaches are reviewed and problems of their practical application are identified. Associated with the fault dictionary approach we consider fault dictionary construction techniques, methods of optimum measurement selection, different fault isolation criteria, and efficient fault simulation techniques. Parameter identification techniques that either utilize linear or nonlinear systems of equations to identify all network elements are examined very thoroughly. Under fault verification techniques we discuss node-fault diagnosis, branch-fault diagnosis, subnetwork testability conditions as well as combinatorial techniques, the failure bound technique, and the network decomposition technique. For the approximation approach we consider probabilistic methods and optimization-based methods. The artificial intelligence technique and the different measures of testability are also considered. The main features of the techniques considered are summarized in a comparative table.

This tutorial paper gives an overview of the current state of the art in adaptive equalization. In the first part of the paper, the problem of intersymbol interference (ISI) and the basic concept of transversal equalizers are introduced followed by a simplified description of some practical adaptive equalizer structures and their properties. Related applications of adaptive filters and implementation approaches are discussed. Linear and nonlinear receiver structures, their steady-state performance and sensitivity to timing phase are presented in some depth in the next part. It is shown that a fractionally spaced equalizer can serve as the optimum receive filter for any receiver. Decision-feedback equalization, decision-aided ISI cancellation, and adaptive filtering for maximum-likelihood sequence estimation are presented in a common framework. The next two parts of the paper are devoted to a discussion of the convergence and steady-state properties of least mean-square (LMS) adaptation algorithms, including digital precision considerations, and three classes of rapidly converging adaptive equalization algorithms: namely, orthogonalized LMS, periodic or cyclic, and recursive least squares algorithms.

Network synchronization is an integral part of any large communication system, such as the telephone network. It also plays an important role in many diverse applications like navigation and position determination, computer communication, data gathering, control and command systems, and phased-array antennas. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the reader to the subject of network synchronization by organizing and presenting a tutorial of the theoretical work accomplished to date. Since the subject material is scattered, disconnected, and couched in different notations, the authors have long felt that it would be significant to organize the material and present the reader with an overview of the growth of the subject. A by-product of such a review should serve as an aid to set direction for future studies and research work. The paper begins by providing the classification of networks into plesiochronous (asynchronous) and synchronous. Further breakdown of this basic classification into a tree-structure hierarchy is presented. Since the time and frequency waveforms transmitted between nodes experience propagation delay, some form of ranging system application is usually required in order to compensate for these delays. Several delay compensation techniques are described and incorporated into a more detailed classification of the synchronization systems. This is then followed by presenting functional network models from which a generic and unified mathematical model is formulated. Network performance measures are defined and the mathematical model is used to characterize the synchronization behavior of the network in terms of these measures. Emphasis is placed on characterizing and understanding network stability, steady-state behavior, effects of clock phase noise, and channel thermal noise. The nonlinear behavior of synchronization systems is also explored. Numerous applications are pointed out and a rather complete list (unfortunately nonexhaustive) of the references is provided for the purpose of directing future research work.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1985.13317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31354","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1985.13317","endPage":"1467","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31354/01457585.pdf","startPage":"1445","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network synchronization","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457585/","displayDocTitle":"Network synchronization","volume":"73","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"Oct. 1985","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network synchronization","sourcePdf":"01457585.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080587S","chronDate":"Oct.  1985","isNumber":"31354","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"153","articleId":"1457585","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1457592,"authors":[{"name":"S.U.

By making use of a theorem by Caratheodory, it is shown that, for a given number of elements, there exists a distribution of element positions which, for uncorrelated sources, results in superior spatial spectrum estimators than are otherwise achievable. The improvement is obtained by constructing an augmented covariance matrix, made possible by the choice of element positions, with dimension greater than the number of array elements. The augmented matrix is then used in any of the known spectrum estimation methods in conjunction with a correspondingly augmented search pointing vector. Examples are given to show the superior detection capability, the larger dynamic range for spectral peak to background level, the lower sidelobes, and the relatively low bias values, when one of the known spectrum estimation techniques based on eigenstructure is used.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1985.13324","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31354/01457592.pdf","startPage":"1522","endPage":"1524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1985.13324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31354","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach to array geometry for improved spatial spectrum estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457592/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1985","displayDocTitle":"A new approach to array geometry for improved spatial spectrum estimation","volume":"73","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach to array geometry for improved spatial spectrum estimation","sourcePdf":"01457592.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025031S","chronDate":"Oct.  1985","isNumber":"31354","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"130","articleId":"1457592","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1457596,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The independent quantization of each signal value or parameter is termed scalar quantization, while the joint quantization of a block of parameters is termed block or vector quantization. This tutorial review presents the basic concepts employed in vector quantization and gives a realistic assessment of its benefits and costs when compared to scalar quantization. Vector quantization is presented as a process of redundancy removal that makes effective use of four interrelated properties of vector parameters: linear dependency (correlation), nonlinear dependency, shape of the probability density function (pdf), and vector dimensionality itself. In contrast, scalar quantization can utilize effectively only linear dependency and pdf shape. The basic concepts are illustrated by means of simple examples and the theoretical limits of vector quantizer performance are reviewed, based on results from rate-distortion theory. Practical issues relating to quantizer design, implementation, and performance in actual applications are explored. While many of the methods presented are quite general and can be used for the coding of arbitrary signals, this paper focuses primarily on the coding of speech signals and parameters.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31355","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31355/01457608.pdf","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1985.13340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1985.13340","startPage":"1551","endPage":"1588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vector quantization in speech coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457608/","displayDocTitle":"Vector quantization in speech coding","isJournal":true,"volume":"73","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"Nov. 1985","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vector quantization in speech coding","sourcePdf":"01457608.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094454S","chronDate":"Nov.  1985","isNumber":"31355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"575","articleId":"1457608","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1457610,"authors":[{"name":"V.W.

Central to this progress has been the development and application of mathematical methods that permit modeling the speech signal as a complex code with several coexisting levels of structure. The most successful of these are \"template matching,\" stochastic modeling, and probabilistic parsing. The manifestation of common themes such as dynamic programming and finite-state descriptions accentuates a superficial likeness amongst the methods which is often mistaken for the deeper similarity arising from their shared Bayesian foundation. In this paper, we outline the mathematical bases of these methods, invariant metrics, hidden Markov chains, and formal grammars, respectively. We then recount and briefly interpret the results of experiments in speech recognition to which the various methods were applied. Since these mathematical principles seem to bear little resemblance to traditional linguistic characterizations of speech, the success of the experiments is occasionally attributed, even by their authors, merely to excellent engineering. We conclude by speculating that, quite to the contrary, these methods actually constitute a powerful theory of speech that can be reconciled with and elucidate conventional linguistic theories while being used to build truly competent mechanical speech recognizers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457612/","volume":"73","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Structural methods in automatic speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structural methods in automatic speech recognition","sourcePdf":"01457612.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091746S","chronDate":"Nov.  1985","isNumber":"31355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"100","articleId":"1457612","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1457613,"authors":[{"name":"G.R.

Considerable progress has been made on both theoretical properties of energy functions and on criteria suitable for on-line implementation. Current theory provides a satisfactory treatment of voltage-dependent reactive power demand, transfer conductances, and flux decay. However, it cannot incorporate the exciter control Proposed on-line criteria appear to work very well on sample examples; but, they still lack rigorous justification. Finally, recent work has shown that power systems can exhibit chaotic behavior.

Perspective is provided by a summary of the role played by nondestructive evaluation in the manufacture and utilization of structural components. Included are discussions of the methodologies for predicting part serviceability and of the constraints placed on the nondestructive measurement process by the mechanical designs and functions of structural components. The principles of active (ultrasonic) and passive (acoustic-emission) testing techniques are then reviewed. Specific examples of applications from several industries illustrate the capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art techniques based on these principles. Detailed discussion is then given of present research and development activities designed to overcome these limitations, with particular emphasis on those areas best addressed by the tools of electrical engineering. Included are discussions of instrumentation, inspection performance modeling, flaw sizing techniques (including imaging systems), material property measurement techniques, and acousticemission techniques. The paper concludes with a consideration of important directions of future work.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1985.13367","startPage":"1716","endPage":"1755","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31356/01457635.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1985.13367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrasonics in nondestructive evaluation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manufacturing","Acoustic measurements","Mechanical variables measurement","Ultrasonic variables measurement","Acoustic testing","Research and development","Electrical engineering","Instruments","Inspection","Acoustic imaging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457635/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1985","displayDocTitle":"Ultrasonics in nondestructive evaluation","volume":"73","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrasonics in nondestructive evaluation","sourcePdf":"01457635.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.191265S","chronDate":"Dec.  1985","isNumber":"31356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"10","articleId":"1457635","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1457648,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The exploitation of information on the echo polarization state through polarimetric radars is currently a subject of interest, due to theoretical and technological advances, as well as to the development of new radar applications. Many polarization techniques, which have been proposed and analyzed to enhance radar performance, are reviewed in this paper in order to assess the possible improvement they can provide in the signal-to-disturbance ratio, target detectability, target discrimination and resolution, and target classification and identification. Some recent experimentally based results relating to these applications are also presented. Those techniques are emphasized for which polarization-based capabilities appear sufficiently assessed, such as adaptive polarization cancellation of clutter, chaff, and jamming. Polarization Doppler processing of dual-polarization radar signals, meteorologic applications, and polarization adaptation for target detection in the clear (in free space) are also examined.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31358","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31358/01457725.pdf","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1986.13457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1986.13457","startPage":"245","endPage":"269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polarization diversity in radars","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457725/","displayDocTitle":"Polarization diversity in radars","isJournal":true,"volume":"74","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"Feb. 1986","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polarization diversity in radars","sourcePdf":"01457725.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.191024S","chronDate":"Feb.  1986","isNumber":"31358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"267","articleId":"1457725","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1457726,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This interpretation leads to statistical tests more insightful than the original tests and makes the procedures computationally tractable.

An important source of these errors will be the products of radioactive decay. It is proposed to combat these transient errors by a new technique called soft-error filtering (SEF). This is based on filtering the input to every latch in the VLSI circuit, thereby preventing these transients, generated by alpha particle hits in the combinational section, from being latched in the corresponding registers. Several approaches to the problem of designing filtering latches are compared. This comparison demonstrates the superiority of a double-filter realization. The design for a CMOS implementation of the double-filter latch is presented. Not only is the design simple and efficient, but it can be expected to be tolerant to process variations. A comparison of SEF with conventional techniques for dealing with soft errors shows the former to be generally much more attractive, from the point of view of both area and time overhead.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1986.13530","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31361/01457798.pdf","startPage":"669","endPage":"683","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1986.13530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft-error filtering: A solution to the reliability problem of future VLSI digital circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457798/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1986","displayDocTitle":"Soft-error filtering: A solution to the reliability problem of future VLSI digital circuits","volume":"74","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1986","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft-error filtering: A solution to the reliability problem of future VLSI digital circuits","sourcePdf":"01457798.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055045S","chronDate":"May  1986","isNumber":"31361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"29","articleId":"1457798","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1457799,"authors":[{"name":"W.R.

With the advent of VLSI technology, large numbers of processing elements which cooperate with each other at high speed have become economically feasible. Since any functional error in a high-performance system may seriously jeopardize the operation of the system and its data integrity, some level of fault tolerance must be incorporated in order to ensure that the results of long computations are valid. Since the major computational requirements for many important real-time signal processing tasks can be reduced to a common set of basic matrix operations, the development of a unified fault-tolerant scheme for matrix operations can solve the problems of both reliable signal processing and reliable matrix operations. Earlier work proposed a low-cost checksum scheme for fault-tolerant matrix operations on multiple processor systems. However, this scheme can only correct errors in matrix multiplication; it can detect, but not correct, errors in matrix-vector multiplication, LU decomposition, matrix inversion, etc. In order to solve these problems with the checksum scheme, a very general matrix encoding scheme is proposed in this paper to achieve fault-tolerant matrix arithmetic and signal processing with linear arrays, which are believed to hold the most promise in VLSI computing structures for their flexibility, low cost, and applicability to most of the interesting algorithms. This proposed technique is, therefore, a very cost-effective encoding technique to achieve fault-tolerant matrix arithmetic and signal processing on highly concurrent VLSI computing structures.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault tolerance","Arithmetic","Signal processing","Concurrent computing","Matrix decomposition","Signal processing algorithms","Very large scale integration","Fault tolerant systems","Error correction","Encoding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1457803","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1986.13535","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31361/01457803.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1986.13535","startPage":"732","endPage":"741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31361","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault-tolerant matrix arithmetic and signal processing on highly concurrent computing structures","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fault-tolerant matrix arithmetic and signal processing on highly concurrent computing structures","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457803/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1986","volume":"74","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"May 1986","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault-tolerant matrix arithmetic and signal processing on highly concurrent computing structures","sourcePdf":"01457803.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057002S","chronDate":"May  1986","isNumber":"31361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"176","articleId":"1457803","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1457808,"authors":[{"name":"L.N.M.

Modulation-doped FETs using this heterojunction system offer many advantages among which are a small gate to conducting channel separation (\u223c 300 \u00c5) leading to extremely high transconductances, a large current-carrying capability (\u223c 500 mA/mm per interface), a small source resistance, and a small saturation voltage. The benefits improve quite substantially at 77 K where the transconductance increases to \u223c 500 mS/mm. Improved device performance has been obtained in both high-speed and digital applications. Modulation-doped FETs used as low-noise amplifiers exhibit noise figures as low as 0.4 dB with 14-dB gain at 10 GHz at 77 K and a noise temperature of 3.5 K at 3.3 GHz with the MODFET cooled to 15 K. The rate of increase in noise temperature is about 1 K/GHz. Quarter micrometer devices have exhibited a current-gain cutoff frequency of 70 GHz. When used as inverters in logic circuits, propagation delays of 12 ps and under 10 ps have been obtained at 300 and 77 K, respectively. Delay times as low as 5 ps are quite possible at 77 K. Static RAMs with 4-kbit complexity exhibited access times of about 2 ns. These results are far superior to any other three-terminal device which is the primary reason why numerous university, industrial, and government laboratories in the U.S., Europe, and Japan have sizable MODFET programs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457824/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1986","publicationDate":"June 1986","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","volume":"74","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modulation-doped GaAs/(Al,Ga)As heterojunction field-effect transistors: MODFETs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modulation-doped GaAs/(Al,Ga)As heterojunction field-effect transistors: MODFETs","sourcePdf":"01457824.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.39073S","chronDate":"June  1986","isNumber":"31362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"24","articleId":"1457824","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1457828,"authors":[{"name":"C.U.

Semiconductor magnetic field sensors exploit the galvanomagnetic effects due to the Lorentz force on charge carriers. Integrated semiconductor, notably silicon, magnetic field sensors, are manufactured using integrated circuit technologies. Integrated sensors are being increasingly developed for a variety of applications in view of the advantage offered by the integration of the magnetic field sensitive element together with support and signal processing circuitry on the same semiconductor chip. The ultimate goal is to develop a broad range of inexpensive batch-fabricated high-performance sensors interfaced with the rapidly proliferating microprocessor. This review aims at the recent progress in integrated silicon magnetic devices such as integrated Hall plates, magnetic field-effect transistors, vertical and lateral bipolar magnetotransistors, magnetodiodes, and current-domain magnetometers. The current development of integrated magnetic field sensors based on III-V semiconductors is described as well. Bulk Hall-effect devices are also reviewed and serve to define terms of performance reference. Magnetic device modeling and the incorporation of magnetic devices into an integrated circuit offering in situ amplification and compensation of offset and temperature effects are further topics of this paper. Silicon will continue to be aggressively exploited in a variety of magnetic (and other) sensor applications, complementary to its traditional role as integrated circuit material.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1986.13597","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31364/01457865.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1986.13597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31364","startPage":"1107","endPage":"1132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated semiconductor magnetic field sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1457865","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Integrated semiconductor magnetic field sensors","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457865/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1986","isJournal":true,"volume":"74","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated semiconductor magnetic field sensors","sourcePdf":"01457865.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.206036S","chronDate":"Aug.  1986","isNumber":"31364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"239","articleId":"1457865","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":1457885,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Quite a few ideas pertaining to zero-crossing counts found in the literature can be expressed and interpreted with the help of this more general setup. A central issue addressed in some detail is the fruitful connection which exists between zero-crossing counts and linear filtering. This connection is explored and interpreted with the help of a certain zero-crossing spectral representation, and is then applied in spectral analysis, detection, and discrimination. Zero-crossing counts in filtered time series are called higher order crossings. The theme of this work is that higher order crossings analysis provides a useful descriptive as well as an analytical tool that can in many respects match spectral analysis. To a great extent these two types of analysis are, in fact, equivalent, but each emphasizes a different point of view. Advantages offered by higher order crossings are great simplicity and a drastic data reduction.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1986.13663","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31367/01457931.pdf","startPage":"1477","endPage":"1493","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1986.13663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral analysis and discrimination by zero-crossings","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457931/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1986","displayDocTitle":"Spectral analysis and discrimination by zero-crossings","volume":"74","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral analysis and discrimination by zero-crossings","sourcePdf":"01457931.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056135S","chronDate":"Nov.  1986","isNumber":"31367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"98","articleId":"1457931","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1457932,"authors":[{"name":"H.N.

A thousand times increase in density and a ten times increase in speed have been recorded. Semiconductor memories have thus been a key element in the revolutionary development of digital electronics. Today, they are undoubtedly entering their age of maturity. Their density limit will be on the order of 100 Mbits per chip, roughly a hundred times the state of the art, and additional speed increase will be less than ten times. Nonetheless, the challenge is still there. Efforts to search for new technology which will actually bring out, in a cost-effective manner, the remaining density and speed potential of semiconductor memories are essential. A thorough investigation is needed to clarify and overcome mechanisms of phenomena which dominate device reliability and degradation. Integrating various data processing, as well as data storing, functions on a chip is the key to adding values to semiconductor memories.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1986.13681","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31368/01457949.pdf","startPage":"1623","endPage":"1635","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1986.13681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semiconductor memory trends","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457949/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1986","displayDocTitle":"Semiconductor memory trends","volume":"74","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semiconductor memory trends","sourcePdf":"01457949.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084355S","chronDate":"Dec.  1986","isNumber":"31368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"7","articleId":"1457949","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1457952,"authors":[{"name":"T.H.

The developments clearly point to three salient features of today's advanced bipolar transistors, namely i) self-aligned structure, ii) deeptrench isolation, and iii) polysilicon emitter contact. Both i) and ii) allow advanced bipolar devices to have much higher circuit density and lower power-delay product than without these features. The polysilicon emitter contact allows bipolar devices to be scaled down vertically without suffering from problems of insufficient current gain or low emitter-collector punchthrough voltage. It is clear that while progress will continue in scaling the familiar high-speed ECL logic and memory, the integration level of these very-high-speed chips is severely limited by the accompanied power dissipation. One seemingly promising and yet relatively unexplored direction is to increase the integration level by taking advantage of circuits with much lower power-delay product than ECL, such as NTL, TTL, CIVIL, and MTL to improve the functional throughput. The technology challenges as well as the potential of submicrometer bipolar technology are also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1986.13684","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31368/01457952.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1986.13684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31368","startPage":"1669","endPage":"1677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bipolar trends","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1457952","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bipolar trends","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457952/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1986","isJournal":true,"volume":"74","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bipolar trends","sourcePdf":"01457952.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106919S","chronDate":"Dec.  1986","isNumber":"31368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"16","articleId":"1457952","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":1457954,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

There is usually no single correct choice, and the decisions are dependent on the environment that the network must work in, the requirements for performance and other functionalities, and the cost and other limitations, in addition, as new hardware and software technologies become available, the parameters governing the decisions change and often result in different selections. This paper outlines a number of design issues and choices available. The intent is to provide an overview of the design decisions that must be made so as to provide a context for the decisions made in a number of existing and developing packet radio networks. It is hoped that this will allow future designs to take advantage of both the wealth of experience available as well as new technologies. Three areas of design decisions are identified. The first area deals with the physical aspects of the network and concentrates on the radio connectivity and channel sharing. The second area deals with the automated management of the network and concentrates on issues such as link management and routing. The third area deals with the interface of the network to the users and some practical aspects of operating and maintaining a network.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Issues in packet radio network design","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1987.13701","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31369/01457969.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1987.13701","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31369","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1457969","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457969/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1987","displayDocTitle":"Issues in packet radio network design","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"75","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"Jan. 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Issues in packet radio network design","sourcePdf":"01457969.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059317S","chronDate":"Jan.  1987","isNumber":"31369","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"85","articleId":"1457969","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1457970,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In this paper, we outline those features that distinguish the High Frequency (HF) Intra Task Force (ITF) Network from other packet radio networks, and we present a design concept for this network that encompasses organizational structure, waveform design, and channel access. Network survivability is achieved through the use of distributed network control and frequency hopping spread-spectrum signaling. We demonstrate how the execution of the fully distributed Linked Cluster Algorithm can enable a network to reconfigure itself when it is affected by connectivity changes such as those resulting from jamming. Additional resistance against jamming is provided by frequency hopping, which leads naturally to the use of code division mutiple access (CDMA) techniques that permit the simultaneous successful transmission by several users. Distributed algorithms that exploit CDMA properties have been developed to schedule contention-free transmissions for much of the channel access in this network. Contention-based channel access protocols can also be implemented in conjunction with the Linked Cluster network structure. The design concept presented in this paper provides a high degree of survivability and flexibility, to accommodate changing environmental conditions and user demands.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457973/","volume":"75","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A design concept for reliable mobile radio networks with frequency hopping signaling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A design concept for reliable mobile radio networks with frequency hopping signaling","sourcePdf":"01457973.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031297S","chronDate":"Jan.  1987","isNumber":"31369","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"530","articleId":"1457973","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":1457975,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Many of these pertain to the RF channel and its use, others pertain to the operational protocols. Clearly, no single model can be formulated which incorporates all the necessary parameters and leads to the optimum solution. The one essential element which complicates matters is that, contrary to point-to-point networks in which each channel is utilized by a single pair of nodes, the radio channel in packet radio networks is a multiaccess broadcast resource: i) in a given locality determined by radio connectivity, the channel is shared by many contending users, hence the need for channel access protocols; ii) radio is a broadcast medium and thus the action taken by a node has an effect on the actions taken by neighboring nodes and their outcome. Despite the complexity of the problem, there has been significant progress worth reporting on. The work accomplished so far has been either the analysis of specific examples of networks or an attempt to create models that would be useful in the design of general networks. The purpose of this paper is to survey the various modeling techniques that have been used for the performance analysis of packet radio networks, and to discuss the assumptions underlying these models, their scope of applicability, and some of the results obtained.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and performance analysis of multihop packet radio networks","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1987.13710","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31369/01457978.pdf","startPage":"135","endPage":"155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1987.13710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31369","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1457978","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1457978/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1987","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and performance analysis of multihop packet radio networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"75","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"Jan. 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and performance analysis of multihop packet radio networks","sourcePdf":"01457978.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054137S","chronDate":"Jan.  1987","isNumber":"31369","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"93","articleId":"1457978","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1457979,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The focus here is on coupling in a locally distributed system through multi-system data sharing in which all systems have direct access to the data. This paper addresses the following questions; i) How does a workload running on a single system today perform if migrated to a multi-system? ii) What are the multi-system locking design issues that limit multi-system performance and what is the maximum number of systems that may be effectively coupled? iii) Can alternative locking designs increase the number of systems that may be effectively coupled? Our analysis is based on traces from large mainframe systems running IBM's IMS database management system. We have developed a hierarchical modeling methodology that starts by synthesizing a multi-system IMS lock trace and a reference trace from single-system traces. The multisystem traces are used in trace-driven simulations to predict lock contention and database I/O increase in multi-system environment and to generate workload parameters. These parameters are used in event-driven simulation models to examine the overall performance under different system structures. Performance results are presented for realistic system parameters to determine the performance impact of various design parameters. Lock contention is found to be the critical factor in determining the coupling effectiveness and the effect of alternative locking design to reduce lock contention is studied. The limit on coupling is explored and the analysis indicates that, for this workload, on the order of 6 to 12 systems may be effectively coupled through data sharing, depending on system structure and locking design.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31373","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31373/01458041.pdf","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1987.13774","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1987.13774","startPage":"573","endPage":"587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On coupling multi-systems through data sharing","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1458041/","displayDocTitle":"On coupling multi-systems through data sharing","isJournal":true,"volume":"75","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","publicationDate":"May 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On coupling multi-systems through data sharing","sourcePdf":"01458041.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057541S","chronDate":"May  1987","isNumber":"31373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"40","articleId":"1458041","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1458053,"authors":[{"name":"M.G.

In the first three sections, several features of the VLSI problem domain which complicate automation are listed. The VLSI design process is diagrammed and the individual steps described. The term \"silicon compilation\" is defined to cover the entire process, and definitions for various subcategories of silicon compilers are given. The next Section describes both algorithmic and knowledge-based techniques Which perform higher level synthesis, including area estimation and module binding concurrent with synthesis. Research at Bell Labs, USC, CMU, and in Canada is described, along with other projects. The fifth section discusses the three categories of silicon compilers: commercially available systems, experimental compilers being developed by industry, and artificial intelligence approaches from university research. A survey of several systems is provided. The last section focuses on two systems developed at CMU and USC which plan or control design activities, Ulysses and DPE. Both systems allow the integration of various design automation tools and determine the proper tool invocation to automatically create a design. ADAM takes an autonomous approach, while ULYSSES follows user-defined scripts.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31374/01458066.pdf","startPage":"777","endPage":"785","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1987.13799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1987.13799","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31374","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1458066","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automating the VLSI design process using expert systems and silicon compilation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Process design","Expert systems","Control system synthesis","Design automation","Silicon compiler","Application specific integrated circuits","Integrated circuit synthesis","Automatic control","Process control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1458066/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1987","displayDocTitle":"Automating the VLSI design process using expert systems and silicon compilation","volume":"75","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1987","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automating the VLSI design process using expert systems and silicon compilation","sourcePdf":"01458066.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077059S","chronDate":"June  1987","isNumber":"31374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"9","articleId":"1458066","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1458091,"authors":[{"name":"C.L.

In this paper we explore its role in estimation problems in which the measured data are statistical observations and moment constraints on the observation function h(x) do not exist. We conclude that: 1) For the class of likelihood problems arising in a complete-incomplete data context in which the complete data x are nonuniquely determined by the measured incomplete data y via the many-to-one mapping y = h(x), the density maximizing entropy is identical to the conditional density of the complete data given the incomplete data. This equivalence results by viewing the measurements as specifying the domain over which the density is defined, rather than as a moment constraint on h(x). 2) The identity between the maximum entropy and the conditional density results in the fact that maximum-likelihood estimates may be obtained via a joint maximization (minimization) of the entropy function (Kullback-Liebler divergence). This provides the basis for the iterative algorithm of Dempster, Laird, and Rubin [1] for the maximization of likelihood functions. 3) This iterative method is used for maximum-likelihood estimation of image parameters in emission tomography and gammaray astronomy. We demonstrate that unconstrained likelihood estimation of image intensities from finite data sets yields unstable estimates. We show how Grenander's method of sieves can be used with the iterative algorithm to remove the instability. A bandwidth sieve is introduced resulting in an estimator which is smoothed via exponential splines. 4) We also derive a recursive algorithm for the generation of Toeplitz constrained maximum-likelihood estimators which at each iteration evaluates conditional mean estimates of the lag products based on the previous estimate of the covariance, from which the updated Toeplitz covariance is generated. We prove that the sequence of Toeplitz estimators has the property that they increase in likelihood, remain in the set of positive-definite Toeplitz covariances, and has all of its limit points stable and satisfying the necessary conditions for maximizing the likelihood.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1987.13825","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31375/01458092.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1987.13825","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31375","startPage":"892","endPage":"907","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The role of likelihood and entropy in incomplete-data problems: Applications to estimating point-process intensities and toeplitz constrained covariances","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1458092","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The role of likelihood and entropy in incomplete-data problems: Applications to estimating point-process intensities and toeplitz constrained covariances","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1458092/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1987","isJournal":true,"volume":"75","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1987","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The role of likelihood and entropy in incomplete-data problems: Applications to estimating point-process intensities and toeplitz constrained covariances","sourcePdf":"01458092.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036232S","chronDate":"July  1987","isNumber":"31375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"108","articleId":"1458092","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1458112,"authors":[{"name":"T.S.

The scheduling of operations upon the availability of their operands has been termed the data-driven mode of execution and offers an elegant solution to the issue. This approach is described in this paper and several architectures which have been proposed or implemented (systolic arrays, data-flow machines, etc.) are examined in detail.

Data flow programs for signal processing are directed graphs where each node represents a function and each arc represents a signal path. Synchronous data flow (SDF) is a special case of data flow (either atomic or large grain) in which the number of data samples produced or consumed by each node on each invocation is specified a priori. Nodes can be scheduled statically (at compile time) onto single or parallel programmable processors so the run-time overhead usually associated with data flow evaporates. Multiple sample rates within the same system are easily and naturally handled. Conditions for correctness of SDF graph are explained and scheduling algorithms are described for homogeneous parallel processors sharing memory. A preliminary SDF software system for automatically generating assembly language code for DSP microcomputers is described. Two new efficiency techniques are introduced, static buffering and an extension to SDF to efficiently implement conditionals.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1987.13876","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1987.13876","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31377/01458143.pdf","startPage":"1235","endPage":"1245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronous data flow","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1987","displayDocTitle":"Synchronous data flow","volume":"75","issue":"9","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1987","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1458143/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronous data flow","sourcePdf":"01458143.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044585S","chronDate":"Sept.  1987","isNumber":"31377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"1096","articleId":"1458143","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1458145,"authors":[{"name":"P.R.

Furthermore, the pace of the technology is being set by the improvements made in semiconductor materials growth using such methods as molecular beam and vapor phase epitaxies. In this paper we discuss the needs of several generic photonic systems for advanced optoelectronic chips. These needs are now being met by the fabrication of high-performance and highly functional integrated transmitters, receivers, modulators, and arrays of such devices. We discuss examples of these and other archetype integrated circuits which serve to illustrate the advances in, and challenges to this new device technology.

The power system control processes needed to maintain a designated security level at minimum operating cost are extremely complicated. They increasingly depend upon on-line computer security analysis and optimization. This on-line technology is still relatively new, with enormous further potential. Since security and optimality are normally conflicting requirements of power system control, it is inappropriate to treat them separately. Therefore, they are slowly becoming coalesced into a unified hierarchical mathematical problem formulation: one that is, however, far too complex to afford anything but an approximate, near-optimal solution. The practical validity of this unifying trend relies on being able to incorporate all significant security constraints within the process. The main two current computational tools in this field are contingency analysis and special operations-oriented versions of optimal power flow (OPF). Contingency analysis identifies potential emergencies through extensive \"what if?.\" simulations on the power system network. OPF is a major extension to the conventional dispatch calculation. It can respect system static security limits, and can schedule reactive as well as active power. Moreover, the advanced versions of OPF include or interface with contingency analysis. This paper reviews present formulations and methods, and tries to point out areas of difficulty that constitute the main challenges for successful practical on-line implementations over the coming years.","doi":"10.1109/PROC.1987.13931","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31380/01458198.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1987.13931","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31380","startPage":"1623","endPage":"1644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security analysis and optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1458198","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Security analysis and optimization","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1458198/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1987","isJournal":true,"volume":"75","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security analysis and optimization","sourcePdf":"01458198.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117228S","chronDate":"Dec.  1987","isNumber":"31380","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"369","articleId":"1458198","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1458199,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

The systems to accomplish these functions are known as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. This paper provides an overview of the functions of SCADA and the fundamentals of operation of SCADA systems, including a brief description of the key man-machine interface.

At such times it becomes difficult to reach a correct diagnosis of the problem or to formulate the correct decision when actions must be taken. Artificial Intelligence gives designers of Energy Management Systems a way to solve many of the diagnosis and decision problems so as to make the EMS more useful. This paper explores reasons why AI techniques, such as knowledge-based expert systems, are being used in EMS designs and the differences between knowledge-based expert systems and traditional numeric algorithm development. The differences between expert systems and the numeric approach extend to the basic conception and design of the applications. This is illustrated using a relay fault diagnosis system, showing both the traditional and rapid prototyping approaches to its development. Finally, issues concerned with the implementation of AI in EMS computers are explored along with the authors' predictions of possible AI applications to power system operations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial intelligence","Power systems","Medical services","Diagnostic expert systems","Application software","Power system relaying","Energy management","Algorithm design and analysis","Fault diagnosis","Prototypes"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PROC.1987.13935","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/31380/01458202.pdf","startPage":"1678","endPage":"1685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1987.13935","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial intelligence in power system operations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1458202","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Artificial intelligence in power system operations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1458202/","volume":"75","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial intelligence in power system operations","sourcePdf":"01458202.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036082S","chronDate":"Dec.  1987","isNumber":"31380","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"48","articleId":"1458202","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1458228,"authors":[{"name":"F.F.

However, many difficulties intrinsic to the wireless environment make meeting the FCC objective challenging. These challenges include channel fading, low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), multiuser interference, and multipath conditions.

In cooperative localization, sensors work together in a peer-to-peer manner to make measurements and then forms a map of the network. Various application requirements influence the design of sensor localization systems. In this article, the authors describe the measurement-based statistical models useful to describe time-of-arrival (TOA), angle-of-arrival (AOA), and received-signal-strength (RSS) measurements in wireless sensor networks. Wideband and ultra-wideband (UWB) measurements, and RF and acoustic media are also discussed. Using the models, the authors have shown the calculation of a Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) on the location estimation precision possible for a given set of measurements. The article briefly surveys a large and growing body of sensor localization algorithms.

The boundary can be reconstructed back by Lagrange's interpolation of the samples. The proposed method uses an iterative procedure, which starts with uniform samples of the boundary. Then these samples are reduced to minimum by split and merge technique, which leads to non-uniform sampling of the boundary. The split and merge technique optimizes the number of control points required to represent a curve, thus achieving high compression ratios. The image boundary contour is optimally sampled to 'n' number of intervals. Then the curve is generated using Lagrange's interpolation method that passes through these n+1 points. The curve regenerated through interpolation is then compared with the original contour by weighted distance transform method Tsang, PWM et al., (1994). If the error is less than the tolerable range, then we merge two sample points to make one point and if the error is more than the tolerable range, then a new sample is added in the middle of two samples. The process is repeated till we get optimum number of sample points to reconstruct the contour. Thus only those sample points are retained which are necessary for reconstruction.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Image sampling","Image reconstruction","Interpolation","Lagrangian functions","Iterative methods","Image coding","Bandwidth","Frequency","Digital images"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image representation","image reconstruction","image sampling","interpolation","iterative methods","optimisation","image coding","data compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image boundary representation","nonuniform sampling technique","image reconstruction","Lagranges interpolation","iterative procedure","split technique","merge technique","optimization","compression ratio","curve regeneration","weighted distance transform method","2D contour"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SPCOM.2004.1458352","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/01458352.png","publicationTitle":"2004 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications, 2004.

It has been observed that the algorithms designed for Gaussian noise typically perform poor in presence of non-Gaussian noise. This paper discusses an error entropy minimization algorithm using kernel density estimates to improve channel estimation in non-Gaussian noise environment. Entropy is a measure of average information contained in a given probability density function. This probability density is assumed unknown and is estimated by using kernel density estimator. Thereby combining entropy cost function with kernel density estimate provides a robust channel estimator in presence of co-channel interference. New lower bounds for co-channel interference effected channel in presence of Gaussian noise are presented as a measure of performance. The simulations for channel estimator in co-channel interference plus Gaussian noise effected channel confirms that a better estimate can be obtained by using the proposed technique as compared to the traditional least squares algorithm, which is considered optimal in the Gaussian noise environments.","doi":"10.1109/SPCOM.2004.1458353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31229","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/01458353.png","startPage":"41","endPage":"45","pdfPath":"/iel5/9869/31229/01458353.pdf","publicationTitle":"2004 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications, 2004.

Among the several recently proposed methods for frame/symbol synchronization, the technique suggested in T. M. Schmidl et. al. (1997) is robust to channel phase and frequency offset. The timing metric proposed in T. M. Schmidl et. al. (1997) reaches a plateau which, in the presence of noise and frequency-selective channel, can give rise to some ambiguity in the start of the frame. In this paper, for the same preamble as in T. M. Schmidl et. al. (1997), we propose a new timing metric, and considering an ideal scenario we show that it yields a sharp peak at the correct symbol boundary. We then analyze the metric and evaluate its mean at the symbol boundary and in its neighborhood for the case of AWGN and frequency-selective channels. The mean values predicted by the analysis are close to those obtained from simulations. Since the derivation of variance expression is tedious, we used simulations to evaluate this at the corresponding time instants. From the results of mean and standard deviation, it is clear that the proposed metric yields sharp peak at the symbol boundary.","doi":"10.1109/SPCOM.2004.1458359","publicationTitle":"2004 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications, 2004.

Diversity techniques applied in OFDM systems help to reduce nonlinear effects produced by the power amplifier. In this paper, low peak to average power ratio (PAPR) techniques clustered OFDM (COFDM) and antenna interleaving OFDM (AIOFDM) applied in a wireless LAN systems are evaluated under nonlinear power amplifier. This paper shows that the bit error rate (BER) obtained using antenna interleaving OFDM is lower compared to the BER obtained applying clustered OFDM and conventional OFDM in fading channels subject to amplifier nonlinearities. The implementation of these low PAPR techniques can help to reduce the power amplifier linearity restrictions increasing the power efficiency.

The receiver is implemented using the constrained minimum output energy (MOE) criterion and the least mean square (LMS) algorithm. The computational complexity of the proposed receiver is only of order N (O(N)) per symbol, where N is the processing gain. The proposed receiver requires only the signature code of the user of interest (UOI) and does not require any training sequences, the channel parameters of any users and signature codes of the interfering users (Timing information is assumed to be known by the receiver). Though the channel parameters of the UOI are not explicitly calculated, the energies of multiple paths are advantageously combined as done in a conventional RAKE receiver. Here multiple access interference (MAI) is first removed and SNR is subsequently maximized using the min-max principle. The bit-error performance of the proposed receiver closely approaches that of the non-blind, non-adaptive MMSE detector. We are also introducing a blind, adaptive, decorrelating receiver, which can be obtained even when noise is zero.","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/01458368.png","displayPublicationTitle":"2004 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications, 2004.

On the other hand, the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique transforms a frequency-selective fading channel into parallel correlated fading channels. Hence, in the presence of frequency selectivity, it is natural to combine STC with the OFDM systems. The channel state information is an essential requirement in the case of ST OFDM systems. In this paper, a unique channel estimation technique for MIMO OFDM systems exploiting the cyclic prefix of OFDM symbols has been proposed.

Transmitter precoding is one such technique and it represents a linear transformation of transmitted signals, such that mean squared error at all receivers is minimised. In this paper, we investigate the performance of transmitter precoding technique for the downlink of multiple input single output (MISO) DS CDMA system over fading channel. Our receivers are constrained to simple matched filters and complete channel information (CSI) at the transmitter is assumed. This is feasible under the time division duplex (TDD) mode of the 3G UMTS system where channel is assumed to be the same on uplink and downlink and can be estimated from the uplink at the base station. It is seen that transmitter precoding for MISO system offers reasonable advantage over single antenna system precoding along with transferring computational complexity to the base station from mobile station.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmitter precoding for space time CDMA system in multiuser communication","publicationTitle":"2004 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications, 2004.

Most of the systems employ frequency offset estimation and correction, as a part of synchronizing the receiver to the transmitter. Depending on the availability of training data and/or the computation power, frequency offset may not be corrected exactly. Moreover, some times we may want to do the correction in the frequency domain in order to reduce the latency and complexity in the receiver. This paper discusses the frequency domain modeling of the effect of residual frequency offset as a linear transformation on the sub-carrier symbols. An interesting property is observed that the transformation matrix is Toeplitz and which simplifies the frequency correction circuit complexity.

In this paper, a novel block-matching algorithm for fast motion estimation namely direct ion-based block-matching algorithm (DBM) is proposed. Existing BMA initiate its search from the center of the search area for every frame, which is time consuming. The proposed algorithm utilizes the temporal correlation in the motion vectors between successive frames to reduce the search time.

In this work, previous frame block motion vector is the reference vector to track the motion of the current block. We also investigate the advantages of partial distortion measures for early jump outs to reduce the computations further. The experimental results reveal that the proposed adaptive search area FSBM algorithm (ASFSBM) saves up to 96% of computations, as compared to FSBM and the estimation accuracy is very close to that of FSBM. To obtain fine motion vector accuracy, ASFSBM has been implemented with half-pixel accuracy. Its performance has been compared with three-step search (TSS) and FSBM for a variety of test video sequences.","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/01458413.png","displayPublicationTitle":"2004 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications, 2004.

As the HWT directly provides the decimated subband components in the frequency domain, it enables direct application of the MGD to subband signals. In the HWT, the decomposition separates different parts of the spectrum into subbands and the decimation stretches each subband spectrum, hence the frequency resolution improves. Further as this also separates a low level spectral peak from a strong neighboring one, the signal detectability also improves. The MGD improves noise immunity, as it not only removes the spectral ripples due to leakage effect but also due to the associated noise. In view of these, the new estimator facilitates a significant improvement in: the reduction of variance, frequency resolution and signal detectability; compared with those of the MGD processing of fullband signals.","doi":"10.1109/SPCOM.2004.1458416","publicationTitle":"2004 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications, 2004.

The SDHWT directly provides subband signals and the WVD of these components are concatenated to get the overall WVD without using antialias and image rejection filtering. The SDHWT and the MMGD remove the existence of crossterms (CT) and the ripple effect due to truncation of the WVD kernel without applying any window, respectively. Since there is no time and frequency smoothing, the proposed method has a better performance in terms of both time and frequency resolution and desirable properties of a time-frequency representation (TFR) than the pseudo WVD (PWVD). Further, it has a relatively better noise immunity compared to that of PWVD. In the WVD, for signal decomposition, the use of SDHWT, compared to that of a filter bank, provides almost similar results but has a significant (72%) computational advantage.","doi":"10.1109/SPCOM.2004.1458417","publicationTitle":"2004 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications, 2004.

The data stream in MC-CDMA is spread using a user specific spreading sequence in the frequency domain and thus, every chip travels on a different sub-carrier. At the receiver, the different sub-carriers have to be combined properly to form the decision variable. minimum mean square error (MMSE) detector is a popular choice for this, but as it tries to minimize the mean square error (MSE) and not the bit error rate (BER), the BER it attains is not optimum. In this paper, we propose a minimum probability of error (MPOE) based linear multiuser detector for uplink MC-CDMA, which tries to minimize the probability of error, by exploiting the probability density function (pdf) of the filter's output. Theoretical and simulation results are presented for the MPOE detector and it can be seen that the MPOE detector outperforms the MMSE detector in terms of BER and near far resistance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum probability of error demodulation for uplink MC-CDMA","publicationTitle":"2004 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications, 2004.

In these limited number of MIPS, we want to achieve the maximum possible frame rate, while maintaining the PSNR of the encoded video. There are several parts of the video encoding process that can be optimized for high quality, high compression ratio and fast encoding speed. We study motion estimation, which is the most computationally intensive part of encoding. We study a novel criterion, the mean removed MAD (MR-MAD) for block matching, which is an improvement over the mean of absolute differences, MAD. We then incorporate MR-MAD into our criterion for decision between coded/non-coded blocks and propose an efficient algorithm that performs well in terms of speed with a small cost in quality and the bit rate for different kinds of motion sequences. We have implemented these optimizations in a MPEG-4 framework and the results are encouraging.","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/01458510.png","displayPublicationTitle":"2004 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications, 2004.

Most existing protocols are based on simple geographical rules and focus on either tree cost or application load balance performance. Little attention is pay to the lower level performance. The paper analyzes the constraints on multicast routing, then formalizes three functions to evaluate an application layer multicast tree on three indexes, cost, application layer load balance and network layer load balance, then generates one fitness function to describe the tree's overall performance. Then the paper proposes the ALMR-GA algorithm, a novel application layer multicast routing approach based on genetic algorithms.

These techniques are used to solve a number of classification problems such as predicting whether or not a chemical compound has the desired biological activity, is toxic or nontoxic, and filtering out drug-like compounds from large compound libraries. This paper presents a substructure-based classification algorithm that decouples the substructure discovery process from the classification model construction and uses frequent subgraph discovery algorithms to find all topological and geometric substructures present in the data set. The advantage of this approach is that during classification model construction, all relevant substructures are available allowing the classifier to intelligently select the most discriminating ones.

A number of techniques have been developed to classify proteins according to important features in their sequences, secondary structures, or three-dimensional structures. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to protein classification based on significant patterns discovered on the surface of a protein. We define a notion called /spl alpha/-surface. We discuss the geometric properties of /spl alpha/-surface and present an algorithm that calculates the /spl alpha/-surface from a finite set of points in R/sup 3/. We apply the algorithm to extracting the /spl alpha/-surface of a protein and use a pattern discovery algorithm to discover frequently occurring patterns on the surfaces. The pattern discovery algorithm utilizes a new index structure called the /spl Delta/B/sup +/ tree. We use these patterns to classify the proteins. While most existing techniques focus on the binary classification problem, we apply our approach to classifying three families of proteins. Experimental results show the good performance of the proposed approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1458700/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 2005","publicationDate":"Aug. 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1458700/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","accessionNumber":"8528316","volume":"17","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Finding patterns on protein surfaces: algorithms and applications to protein classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finding patterns on protein surfaces: algorithms and applications to protein classification","sourcePdf":"01458700.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136445S","chronDate":"Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"31394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"31394","articleId":"1458700","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1458740,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Dou Ker","affiliation":["Nanoelectronics and Gigascale Systems Laboratory, Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7298/31396/1458740/1458740-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ming-Dou Ker (S'92\u2013M'94\u2013SM'97) received the B.S. degree from the Department of Electronics Engineering and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Institute of Electronics, National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1986, 1988, and 1993, respectively.","In 1994, he joined the VLSI Design Department of the Computer and Communication Research Laboratories (CCL), Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), Taiwan, as a Circuit Design Engineer.

We show that an equilibrium of TCP/IP, if exists, maximizes aggregate utility over both source rates and routes, provided congestion prices are used as link costs. An equilibrium exists if and only if this utility maximization problem and its Lagrangian dual have no duality gap. In this case, TCP/IP incurs no penalty in not splitting traffic across multiple paths. Such an equilibrium, however, can be unstable. It can be stabilized by adding a static component to link cost, but at the expense of a reduced utility in equilibrium. If link capacities are optimally provisioned, however, pure static routing, which is necessarily stable, is sufficient to maximize utility. Moreover single-path routing again achieves the same utility as multipath routing at optimality.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31397","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2005.850219","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/31397/01458766.pdf","startPage":"582","endPage":"595","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2005.850219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-layer optimization in TCP/IP networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Cross-layer optimization in TCP/IP networks","volume":"13","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1458766/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2005","accessionNumber":"8519886","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1458766/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-layer optimization in TCP/IP networks","sourcePdf":"01458766.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132832S","chronDate":"June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"31397","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"31397","articleId":"1458766","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":1458768,"authors":[{"name":"Hongyi Wu","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Louisiana, Lafayette, LA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/31397/1458768/1458768-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hongyi Wu (M'02) received the B.S. degree in scientific instruments from Zhejiang University in 1996, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo in 2000 and 2002, respectively.","He is currently an Assistant Professor at the Center for Advanced Computer Studies (CACS), University of Louisiana (UL) at Lafayette.

In this paper, we propose a novel self-configurable positioning technique for multihop wireless networks, based on a Euclidean distance estimation model and a coordinates establishment scheme. A number of nodes serve as the landmarks to establish a coordinates system. Specifically, any pair of landmarks estimate their Euclidean distance according to the shortest path length between them and establish the coordinates system by minimizing an error objective function. Other nodes in the network can accordingly contact the landmarks and determine their own coordinates. The proposed technique is independent of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs), and the established coordinates can be easily tuned to GNSS if at least one node in the network is equipped with GNSS receiver. Our simulation results show that the proposed self-configurable positioning technique is highly fault-tolerable to measurement inaccuracy and can effectively establish the coordinates for multihop wireless networks. More landmarks yield more accurate results. With the rectification of our Euclidean distance estimation model, four to seven landmarks are usually sufficient to meet the accuracy requirement in a network with hundreds of nodes. The computing time for coordinates establishment is in the order of milliseconds for a GHz CPU, acceptable for most applications in the mobile ad hoc networks as well as the sensor networks.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2005.850202","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/31397/01458768.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2005.850202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31397","startPage":"609","endPage":"621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel self-configurable positioning technique for multihop wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1458768","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Novel self-configurable positioning technique for multihop wireless networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1458768/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2005","accessionNumber":"8519888","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1458768/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel self-configurable positioning technique for multihop wireless networks","sourcePdf":"01458768.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.3902S","chronDate":"June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"31397","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"31397","articleId":"1458768","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1458772,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The problem is to create a feasible path from a given node to the destination such that the bandwidth and reliability requirements of the path are satisfied and the cost of the path is minimized (Reliability Constrained Least Cost Routing Problem). To solve the problem, we propose an approach which employs a novel concept, called partial protection, wherein backup paths are created for a selected set of domains in the network so as to meet the reliability constraints. The Partial Protection Approach (PPA) has two steps: Primary Path Creation and Backup Path Creation if necessary. To implement PPA, we propose three scalable two-pass resource reservation schemes, viz., Conservative, Optimistic, and Hybrid schemes. These schemes differ depending on whether the backup paths are created during the forward pass, reverse pass, or both. We evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes for dynamic multicast groups with different bandwidth and reliability requirements using average call acceptance rate and average tree cost as performance metrics. Our studies show that group dynamics and reliability requirements have significant impact on the performance of the schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2005.850222","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/31397/01458772.pdf","startPage":"662","endPage":"675","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2005.850222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31397","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability constrained routing in QoS networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1458772","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1458772/","displayDocTitle":"Reliability constrained routing in QoS networks","volume":"13","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2005","accessionNumber":"8519892","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1458772/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability constrained routing in QoS networks","sourcePdf":"01458772.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076909S","chronDate":"June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"31397","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"31397","articleId":"1458772","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1458782,"authors":[{"name":"S.R.

Coding schemes exist that tackle these problems individually. In this paper, we present a coding framework derived from a communication-theoretic view of a DSM bus to jointly address power, delay, and reliability. In this framework, the data is first passed through a nonlinear source coder that reduces self and coupling transition activity and imposes a constraint on the peak coupling transitions on the bus. Next, a linear error control coder adds redundancy to enable error detection and correction. The framework is employed to efficiently combine existing codes and to derive novel codes that span a wide range of tradeoffs between bus delay, codec latency, power, area, and reliability. Using simulation results in 0.13-/spl mu/m CMOS technology, we show that coding is a better alternative to repeater insertion for delay reduction as it reduces power dissipation at the same time. For a 10-mm 4-bit bus, we show that a bus employing the proposed codes achieves up to 2.17/spl times/ speed-up and 33% energy savings over a bus employing Hamming code. For a 10-mm 32-bit bus, we show that 1.7/spl times/ speed-up and 27% reduction in energy are achievable over an uncoded bus by employing low-swing signaling without any loss in reliability.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System-on-a-chip","Couplings","CMOS technology","Propagation delay","Added delay","Error correction","Redundancy","Error correction codes","Codecs","Repeaters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system-on-chip","integrated circuit interconnections","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit noise","Hamming codes","error correction codes","error detection codes","CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit reliability","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global buses","system-on-chip designs","propagation delays","DSM noise","coding schemes","nonlinear source coder","self transition activity","coupling transition activity","peak coupling transitions","linear error control","error detection","error correction","bus delay","codec latency","CMOS technology","repeater insertion","delay reduction","power dissipation","energy saving","Hamming code","low-swing signaling","bus coding","crosstalk avoidance","interconnection networks","low-power design","on-chip buses","0.13 micron","10 mm","4 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bus coding","bus delay","crosstalk avoidance","interconnection networks","low-power","on-chip buses","reliability","system-on-chip"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1458782","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2005.848816","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/31398/01458782.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2005.848816","startPage":"655","endPage":"667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31398","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coding for system-on-chip networks: a unified framework","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Coding for system-on-chip networks: a unified framework","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1458782/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","volume":"13","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1458782/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","publicationDate":"June 2005","accessionNumber":"8529113","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding for system-on-chip networks: a unified framework","sourcePdf":"01458782.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100531S","chronDate":"June  2005","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"31398","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"140","xplore-issue":"31398","articleId":"1458782","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1458783,"authors":[{"name":"Yangdong Deng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Camegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/31398/1458783/1458783-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yangdong (Steven) Deng (S'98) received the M.E. degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1998.

A new hybrid style full adder circuit is also presented. The sum and carry generation circuits of the proposed full adder are designed with hybrid logic styles. To operate at ultra-low supply voltage, the pass logic circuit that cogenerates the intermediate XOR and XNOR outputs has been improved to overcome the switching delay problem. As full adders are frequently employed in a tree structured configuration for high-performance arithmetic circuits, a cascaded simulation structure is introduced to evaluate the full adders in a realistic application environment. A systematic and elegant procedure to scale the transistor for minimal power-delay product is proposed. The circuits being studied are optimized for energy efficiency at 0.18-/spl mu/m CMOS process technology. With the proposed simulation environment, it is shown that some survival cells in stand alone operation at low voltage may fail when cascaded in a larger circuit, either due to the lack of drivability or unsatisfactory speed of operation. The proposed hybrid full adder exhibits not only the full swing logic and balanced outputs but also strong output drivability. The increase in the transistor count of its complementary CMOS output stage is compensated by its area efficient layout. Therefore, it remains one of the best contenders for designing large tree structured arithmetic circuits with reduced energy consumption while keeping the increase in area to a minimum.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2005.848806","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/31398/01458785.pdf","startPage":"686","endPage":"695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2005.848806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31398","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A review of 0.18-/spl mu/m full adder performances for tree structured arithmetic circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1458785","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1458785/","displayDocTitle":"A review of 0.18-/spl mu/m full adder performances for tree structured arithmetic circuits","volume":"13","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2005","accessionNumber":"8529116","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1458785/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A review of 0.18-/spl mu/m full adder performances for tree structured arithmetic circuits","sourcePdf":"01458785.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091357S","chronDate":"June  2005","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"31398","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"206","xplore-issue":"31398","articleId":"1458785","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":1458789,"authors":[{"name":"Shyue-Kung Lu","affiliation":["Very Large Scale Integration, Computer-Aided Design Laboratory, Department of Electronic Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/31398/1458789/1458789-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shyue-Kung Lu received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the National Taiwan University, Taipei, in 1995.","From 1995 to 1998, he was an Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering, Lunghwa Junior College of Technology and Commerce.

Our M-testability conditions guarantee 100% single-module-fault testability with a minimum number of test patterns. Based on this testable design, fault-tolerant approaches at the bit level and the multiply-subtract-add (MSA) module level are proposed, respectively. If the reconfiguration is performed at the bit level, then the FFT/sub BIT/ network is constructed. Two types of reconfiguration schemes (Type-I FFT/sub MSA/ and Type-II FFT/sub MSA/) are proposed at the MSA module level. Since both the design for testability (DFT) and the design for yield (DFY) issues are considered at the same time for all these proposed approaches, the resulting architectures are simpler as compared with previous works. The reliability of the FFT system increases significantly. The hardware overhead is low-about 12% and 1/2N for the FFT/sub BIT/ network and the Type-II FFT/sub MSA/ network, respectively. An experimental chip is also implemented to verify our approaches. Reliabilities and hardware overhead are also evaluated and compared with previous works.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2005.844306","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/31398/01458789.pdf","startPage":"732","endPage":"741","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2005.844306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31398","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design-for-testability and fault-tolerant techniques for FFT processors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1458789","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1458789/","displayDocTitle":"Design-for-testability and fault-tolerant techniques for FFT processors","volume":"13","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2005","accessionNumber":"8529120","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1458789/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design-for-testability and fault-tolerant techniques for FFT processors","sourcePdf":"01458789.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071205S","chronDate":"June  2005","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"31398","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"31398","articleId":"1458789","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1458790,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Fu Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jung Li, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jin-Fu Li","id":"37279861800"},{"name":"J.-C.

We demonstrate the accuracy of the method by applying it to examples of high-performance 32- and 64-b adders in 100- and 130-nm CMOS technologies.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2005.848819","startPage":"754","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/31398/01458793.pdf","endPage":"758","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31398","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2005.848819","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1458793/","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of high-performance VLSI adders in the energy-delay space","volume":"13","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1458793/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8529124","publicationDate":"June 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of high-performance VLSI adders in the energy-delay space","sourcePdf":"01458793.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055969S","chronDate":"June  2005","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"31398","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"31398","articleId":"1458793","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1458794,"authors":[{"name":"S.W.

In the proposed architecture, existing configuration memory normally used to control the connectivity pattern of the FPGA is made user accessible. Typically, not all the switch blocks in an FPGA are used to transport signals. By adding only a modest amount of circuitry, the configuration memory in these unused switch blocks (or unused paths within used switch blocks) can be used to implement wide, shallow buffers and other similar memory structures. The size of FPGA required to implement a benchmark circuit that makes use of the wide, shallow memories, is 20% smaller than a standard memory architecture. In addition, the benchmark circuit is on average 40% faster using the proposed architecture.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/31398/01458794.pdf","startPage":"758","endPage":"762","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2005.848817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2005.848817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31398","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1458794","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel FPGA architecture supporting wide, shallow memories","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Switches","Random access memory","Read-write memory","Switching circuits","Logic devices","Memory architecture","Programmable logic arrays","Application specific integrated circuits","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memory architecture","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","embedded systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA architecture","wide/shallow memories","field programmable gate array","configuration memory","user accessible","switch blocks","benchmark circuit","embedded memory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Embedded memory","field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1458794/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"A novel FPGA architecture supporting wide, shallow memories","volume":"13","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1458794/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2005","accessionNumber":"8529125","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel FPGA architecture supporting wide, shallow memories","sourcePdf":"01458794.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058526S","chronDate":"June  2005","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"31398","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"31398","articleId":"1458794","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1458804,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The measured results are in good agreement with the simulated predictions. The overall size of the filter is only about 0.22/spl lambda//sub g/ by 0.2 /spl lambda//sub g/.

As a result, the complexity and computation load increase drastically. This paper presents a fast mode decision algorithm for H.264/AVC intraprediction based on local edge information. Prior to intraprediction, an edge map is created and a local edge direction histogram is then established for each subblock. Based on the distribution of the edge direction histogram, only a small part of intraprediction modes are chosen for RDO calculation.

On the other hand, most video compression standards recommend motion compensation in the spatial domain. Thus, compressed data that is motion-compensated in the spatial domain should be motion-compensated in the transform domain for the transform-domain transcoding. However, this combination of encoding in the spatial domain and decoding in the transform domain degrades image quality due to mismatches of the inverse DCT and motion compensation. There have been few investigations into this mismatch problem. In this paper, we establish that the rounding in calculation is the major cause of the mismatch. We investigate the mismatch problem in detail and propose a precision lifting method to reduce the effects of the mismatch problem. Experimental results show that our proposed method can effectively reduce the mismatch problem.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/31400/01458826.pdf","startPage":"835","endPage":"843","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2005.848353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2005.848353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31400","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1458826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of IDCT and motion-compensation mismatches between spatial-domain and transform-domain motion-compensated coders","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion analysis","Discrete cosine transforms","Transcoding","Video compression","Motion compensation","Image coding","Streaming media","Computational complexity","Discrete transforms","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","motion compensation","image matching","transform coding","data compression","video coding","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IDCT analysis","motion-compensation mismatch","spatial-domain motion-compensated coder","transform-domain motion-compensated coder","video stream compression","video coding","inverse discrete cosine transform","computational complexity","data compression","transform-domain transcoding","image matching","precision lifting method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Inverse discrete cosine transform (IDCT)","mismatch","motion compensation (MC)","precision lifting (PL)","rounding","transcoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1458826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of IDCT and motion-compensation mismatches between spatial-domain and transform-domain motion-compensated coders","volume":"15","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/1458826/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8528669","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of IDCT and motion-compensation mismatches between spatial-domain and transform-domain motion-compensated coders","sourcePdf":"01458826.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04899S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"31400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"31400","articleId":"1458826","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1458832,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Tsung Huang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/31400/1458832/1458832-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chao-Tsung Huang was born in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1979.

However, as a single bit is used in the representation of image frames, bad motion vectors are likely to be resolved in 1BT-based motion estimation algorithms particularly for small block sizes. It is proposed in this paper to utilize a two-bit transform (2BT) for block-based motion estimation. Image frames are converted into two-bit representations by a simple block-by-block two bit transform based on multithresholding with mean and linearly approximated standard deviation values. In order to avoid blocking effects at block boundaries during the block-by-block transformation while enabling the two-bit representation to be constructed according to local detail, threshold values are computed within a larger window surrounding the transforming block. The 2BT makes use of lower bit-depth and binary matching criteria properties of 1BTs to achieve low-complexity block motion estimation. The 2BT improves motion estimation accuracy and seriously reduces the amount of bad motion vectors compared to 1BTs, particularly for small block sizes. It is shown that the proposed 2BT-based motion estimation technique improves motion estimation accuracy in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio of reconstructed frames and also results in visually more accurate frames subsequent to motion compensation compared to the 1BT-based motion estimation approach.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2005.848340","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/31400/01458836.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2005.848340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31400","startPage":"938","endPage":"946","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-bit transform for binary block motion estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1458836","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Two-bit transform for binary block motion estimation","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1458836/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8528679","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1458836/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-bit transform for binary block motion estimation","sourcePdf":"01458836.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049807S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"31400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"31400","articleId":"1458836","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1458837,"authors":[{"name":"E.

This new feature has achieved significant coding gain compared to coding a macroblock (MB) using fixed block size. However, this feature results in extremely high computational complexity when brute force rate distortion optimization (RDO) algorithm is used. This paper proposes a fast intermode decision algorithm to decide the best mode in intercoding. It makes use of the spatial homogeneity and the temporal stationarity characteristics of video objects. Specifically, spatial homogeneity of a MB is decided based on the MB's edge intensity, and temporal stationarity is decided by the difference of the current MB and it colocated counterpart in the reference frame. Based on the homogeneity and stationarity of the video objects, only a small number of intermodes are selected in the RDO process. The experimental results show that the fast intermode decision algorithm is able to reduce on the average 30% encoding time, with a negligible peak signal-to-noise ratio loss of 0.03 dB or, equivalently, a bit rate increment of 0.6%.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/31400/01458838.pdf","startPage":"953","endPage":"958","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2005.848304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2005.848304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31400","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1458838","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast intermode decision in H.264/AVC video coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic voltage control","Video coding","Motion estimation","Costs","Computational complexity","Rate-distortion","PSNR","MPEG 4 Standard","Bit rate","IEC standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding","block codes","image texture","image sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast intermode decision algorithm","H.264-AVC video coding standard","interframe coding","macroblock coding","computational complexity","rate distortion optimization algorithm","temporal stationarity characteristic","edge intensity","spatial homogeneity","signal-to-noise ratio","image texture","video sequence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video coding","H.264","AVC","RDO","homogeneity","stationarity","inter mode"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1458838/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Fast intermode decision in H.264/AVC video coding","volume":"15","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/1458838/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8528681","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast intermode decision in H.264/AVC video coding","sourcePdf":"01458838.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066955S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"31400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"234","xplore-issue":"31400","articleId":"1458838","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1458847,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

The technique is based on deriving a directional quantity proportional to the fault current signal and the prefault voltage signal. Standard fast wavelet transform (FWT) schemes may not be as effective for data that has chiefly oscillatory features. An effective solution to discrimination involves examining the signal in both the time and frequency domains simultaneously. The wavelet packet transform is an extension of the FWT that allows for finer characterization of signal content for both time and frequency together. A 11/132-kV transformer connected to a 132-kV power system was simulated using Alternative Transient Program/Electromagnetic Transient Program (ATP/EMTP). Results indicate that the proposed technique is stable, reliable, and fast during the discrimination between internal and external faults, magnetizing inrush currents, and internal faults, ratio-mismatch, and saturation of current transformers (CTs).","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2005.848646","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","startPage":"1830","endPage":"1836","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2005.848646","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31401","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/31401/01458850.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protection","Wavelet packets","Current transformers","Circuit faults","Wavelet transforms","Power system reliability","Power system simulation","Power system transients","EMTP","Fault currents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power transformer protection","fault currents","wavelet transforms","time-domain analysis","frequency-domain analysis","EMTP","current transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital directional transformer protection","wavelet packet transforms","fault current signal","fast wavelet transform schemes","oscillatory features","frequency domains","time domains","alternative transient program","electromagnetic transient program","EMTP","magnetizing inrush currents","ratio-mismatch","current transformer saturation","11 kV","32 kV"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Current-transformer (CT) saturation","inrush current","ratio-mismatch","transformer faults","wavelet packet transform (WPT)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A novel digital directional transformer protection technique based on wavelet packet","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1458850/","volume":"20","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1458850/","accessionNumber":"8526424","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","publicationDate":"July 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel digital directional transformer protection technique based on wavelet packet","sourcePdf":"01458850.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079043S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"31401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"31401","articleId":"1458850","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":1458855,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Designing nonlinear systems, such as power-electronic converters, to be robust is a challenging task as settings that may be optimal for a given operating configuration may be inadequate for another. This paper extends the method of combining nonlinear optimization with electromagnetic transient simulation, which has previously been successfully applied to the design of optimal systems at only one operating point; to an approach which simultaneously considers a range of operating points. The method is exemplified using two examples. In the first example, a dc power supply is designed to operate optimally over a range of current order settings. The second is the case of an HVdc system, which is optimized to work well with a range of possible ac system configurations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1458871/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","volume":"20","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","accessionNumber":"8517296","publicationDate":"July 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1458871/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Inclusion of robustness into design using optimization-enabled transient simulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inclusion of robustness into design using optimization-enabled transient simulation","sourcePdf":"01458871.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051047S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"31401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"31401","articleId":"1458871","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1458891,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The optimization technique adopted in this paper is the artificial neural network-aided simulated-annealing (SA) algorithm. By coupling a trained neural net with the annealing algorithm, the execution speed of the latter is greatly enhanced to evaluate the optimum values for the design parameters of the electrode-spacer arrangements compared to calculating the cost function via the entire process for field calculation at every move of the optimization algorithm. The convergence of the optimization algorithm has also been compared statistically with the genetic algorithm. The results presented in this paper show that optimized electrode-spacer contours have been obtained with an acceptable degree of accuracy using the neural-network-aided SA algorithm. The statistical analysis shows a promising result for the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2004.843457","startPage":"2144","endPage":"2152","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/31401/01458891.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2004.843457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel approach based on Simulated annealing coupled to artificial neural network for 3-D electric-field optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Simulated annealing","Artificial neural networks","Electrodes","Stress","Design optimization","Boundary element methods","Optimization methods","Power transformer insulation","Cost function","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simulated annealing","genetic algorithms","neural nets","electric fields","power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simulated annealing","artificial neural network","3D electric field optimization","stress distribution","electrode-spacer arrangement","gas-insulated systems","genetic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial neural network (ANN)","indirect boundary element method (BEM)","optimization of three-dimensional (3-D) electric field","simulated annealing (SA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1458891/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","displayDocTitle":"A novel approach based on Simulated annealing coupled to artificial neural network for 3-D electric-field optimization","volume":"20","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1458891/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","accessionNumber":"8526450","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel approach based on Simulated annealing coupled to artificial neural network for 3-D electric-field optimization","sourcePdf":"01458891.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096722S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"31401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"31401","articleId":"1458891","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1458900,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

As each portion of the application starts to execute, the system partially reconfigures the datapath so as to perform the corresponding computation. The reconfigurable datapath should have as few and simple hardware blocks and interconnections as possible, in order to reduce its cost, area, and reconfiguration overhead. To achieve that, hardware blocks and interconnections should be reused as much as possible across the application. We represent each piece of the application as a data-flow graph (DFG). The DFG merging process identifies similarities among the DFGs, and produces a single datapath that can be dynamically reconfigured and has a minimum area cost, when considering both hardware blocks and interconnections. In this paper we present a novel technique for the DFG merge problem, and we evaluate it using programs from the MediaBench benchmark. Our algorithm execution time approaches the fastest previous solution to this problem and produces datapaths with an average area reduction of 20%. When compared to the best known area solution, our approach produces datapaths with area costs equivalent to (and in many cases better than) it, while achieving impressive speedups.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2005.850844","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/31402/01458926.pdf","startPage":"969","endPage":"980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2005.850844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient datapath merging for partially reconfigurable architectures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Efficient datapath merging for partially reconfigurable architectures","volume":"24","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","accessionNumber":"8522973","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1458926/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1458926/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient datapath merging for partially reconfigurable architectures","sourcePdf":"01458926.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109609S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"31402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"31402","articleId":"1458926","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1458930,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Previous system-level approaches focus on reducing power consumption without considering leakage power consumption. To overcome this limitation, we propose a two-phase approach to combine dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) and adaptive body biasing (ABB) for distributed real-time embedded systems. DVS is a powerful technique for reducing dynamic power consumption quadratically. However, DVS often requires a reduction in the threshold voltage that increases subthreshold leakage current exponentially and, hence, subthreshold leakage power consumption. ABB, which exploits the exponential dependence of subthreshold leakage power on the threshold voltage, is effective in managing leakage power consumption. We first derive an energy consumption model to determine the optimal supply voltage and body bias voltage under a given clock frequency. Then, we analyze the tradeoff between energy consumption and clock period to allocate slack to a set of tasks with precedence relationships and real-time constraints. Based on this two-phase approach, we propose a new system-level scheduling algorithm that can optimize both dynamic power and leakage power consumption by performing DVS and ABB simultaneously for distributed real-time embedded systems. Experimental results show that the average power reduction of our technique with respect to DVS alone is 37.4% for the 70-nm technology.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2005.850895","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/31402/01458930.pdf","startPage":"1030","endPage":"1041","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2005.850895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint dynamic voltage scaling and adaptive body biasing for heterogeneous distributed real-time embedded systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1458930","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1458930/","displayDocTitle":"Joint dynamic voltage scaling and adaptive body biasing for heterogeneous distributed real-time embedded systems","volume":"24","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8522977","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1458930/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint dynamic voltage scaling and adaptive body biasing for heterogeneous distributed real-time embedded systems","sourcePdf":"01458930.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086453S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"31402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"31402","articleId":"1458930","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":1458931,"authors":[{"name":"Weiping Liao","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/31402/1458931/1458931-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Weiping Liao (S'05) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees, both in physics, from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 1996 and 1999, respectively, and the M.S. degree in computer engineering from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, in 2002.

Performance is affected by both temperature and supply voltage because of the temperature and voltage dependence of circuit delay. Furthermore, as semiconductor technology scales down, leakage power's exponential dependence on temperature and supply voltage becomes significant. Therefore, future design studies call for temperature and voltage aware performance and power modeling. In this paper, we study microarchitecture-level temperature and voltage aware performance and power modeling. We present a leakage power model with temperature and voltage scaling, and show that leakage and total energy vary by 38% and 24%, respectively, between 65/spl deg/C and 110/spl deg/C. We study thermal runaway induced by the interdependence between temperature and leakage power, and demonstrate that without temperature-aware modeling, underestimation of leakage power may lead to the failure of thermal controls, and overestimation of leakage power may result in excessive performance penalties of up to 5.24%. All of these studies underscore the necessity of temperature-aware power modeling. Furthermore, we study optimal voltage scaling for best performance with dynamic power and thermal management under different packaging options. We show that dynamic power and thermal management allows designs to target at the common-case thermal scenario among benchmarks and improves performance by 6.59% compared to designs targeted at the worst case thermal scenario without dynamic power and thermal management. Additionally, the optimal V/sub dd/ for the best performance may not be the largest V/sub dd/ allowed by the given packaging platform, and that advanced cooling techniques can improve throughput significantly.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2005.850860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31402","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2005.850860","endPage":"1053","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/31402/01458931.pdf","startPage":"1042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temperature and supply Voltage aware performance and power modeling at microarchitecture level","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1458931/","displayDocTitle":"Temperature and supply Voltage aware performance and power modeling at microarchitecture level","volume":"24","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"8513041","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1458931/","publicationDate":"July 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temperature and supply Voltage aware performance and power modeling at microarchitecture level","sourcePdf":"01458931.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101016S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"31402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"191","xplore-issue":"31402","articleId":"1458931","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1458932,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Most of the current interconnect estimation techniques estimate either the average or the total wirelength and some qualitative measure of routing demand for circuits. A priori techniques estimate these parameters without actually performing circuit placement. We propose a new a priori interconnect and wirelength estimation methodology for island style field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). For a given design, we estimate bounding box semiperimeter wirelengths of all nets for an optimized placement and the minimum number of tracks per channel required for successful routing on an FPGA device. We analyze the structural characteristics of circuits and limitations posed by the FPGA architecture to derive a consistent model for wirelength and routing demand estimation. We identify reconvergences present in a circuit as an important global circuit characteristic in wirelength prediction. Our overall results show that we have an average error of 11.6% w.r.t. semiperimeter wirelength measured from the optimized layout using VPR. Also, the number of routing tracks per channel is predicted with an average error of 13.2% of the detailed routing results from VPR.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/31402/01458932.pdf","startPage":"1054","endPage":"1065","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2005.850868","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2005.850868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31402","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1458932","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A priori wirelength and interconnect estimation based on circuit characteristics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit interconnections","Routing","Field programmable gate arrays","Design automation","Application specific integrated circuits","Current measurement","Parameter estimation","Design optimization","Prediction methods","Calibration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit interconnections","field programmable gate arrays","network routing","circuit layout CAD","integrated circuit layout","logic CAD","circuit optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["a priori wirelength estimation","a priori interconnect estimation","circuit characteristics","integrated circuit interconnection","parameter estimation","circuit placement","island style field programmable gate arrays","circuit optimization","integrated circuit layout","FPGA architecture","routing demand estimation","wirelength prediction","interconnect prediction","network routing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["A priori estimation","interconnect estimation","placement","preplacement estimation","routing demand","wirelength"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1458932/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"A priori wirelength and interconnect estimation based on circuit characteristics","volume":"24","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/1458932/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8522978","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A priori wirelength and interconnect estimation based on circuit characteristics","sourcePdf":"01458932.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089014S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"31402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"31402","articleId":"1458932","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1458933,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Zhu","affiliation":["Computer Science and Technology Department, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/31402/1458933/1458933-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qi Zhu (S'03) received the B.E. degree in computer science and technology from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2003.

One of them is the interconnect effects, which may cause longer delay and heavier crosstalk. To solve this problem, many interconnect performance optimization algorithms have been proposed. However, when these algorithms are designed based on rectilinear interconnect architecture, the optimization capability is limited. Therefore, nonrectilinear interconnect architectures become a field of active research in which the octilinear interconnect architecture is the most promising one since it extends from the rectilinear case and greatly shortens the wire length. Meanwhile, an interconnect with less length is helpful to reduce wire capacitance, congestion, and routing area. In an interconnect architecture, the Steiner minimal tree (SMT) construction is one of the key problems. In this paper, we give two practical octilinear Steiner minimal tree (OSMT) construction algorithms based on octilinear spanning graphs (OSGs). The one with edge substitution (OST-E) has a worst-case running time of O(nlogn) and a similar performance as the recent work using batched greedy. The other one with triangle contraction (OST-T) has a small increase in the constant factor of running time and a better performance. These two are the fastest algorithms for octilinear Steiner tree construction so far. Experiments on both industrial and random test cases are conducted to compare with other programs.

Starting with a conventional depletion-mode HEMT sample, we found that fluoride-based plasma treatment can effectively shift the threshold voltage from -4.0 to 0.9 V.

This behavior is demonstrated with different metal combinations on both SiO/sub 2/ and HfO/sub 2/ gate dielectrics. We use capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics to investigate the effect of different annealing conditions and different metal/metal bilayer couples on the work function. By comparing the as-deposited and annealed films, and by comparing with metals that are relatively inert with each other, we deduce that the work function tuning behavior likely involves metal/metal interdiffusion.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/55/31403/01458951.pdf","startPage":"445","endPage":"447","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","doi":"10.1109/LED.2005.851232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2005.851232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31403","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1458951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characteristics and mechanism of tunable work function gate electrodes using a bilayer metal structure on SiO/sub 2/ and HfO/sub 2/","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrodes","Hafnium oxide","Annealing","CMOS technology","Materials science and technology","Dielectric thin films","Plasma temperature","Stacking","Capacitance","Threshold voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dielectric thin films","MIS devices","metal-insulator boundaries","work function","annealing","silicon compounds","hafnium compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tunable work function gate electrodes","bilayer metal structure","MOS structure","metal layer thickness","metal combinations","gate dielectrics","capacitance-voltage characteristics","annealing conditions","metal/metal bilayer couples","as-deposited films","annealed films","metal/metal interdiffusion","high-k dielectrics","SiO/sub 2/","HfO/sub 2/"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["high-","metal gate","work function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1458951/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Characteristics and mechanism of tunable work function gate electrodes using a bilayer metal structure on SiO/sub 2/ and HfO/sub 2/","volume":"26","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/1458951/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8525337","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characteristics and mechanism of tunable work function gate electrodes using a bilayer metal structure on SiO/sub 2/ and HfO/sub 2/","sourcePdf":"01458951.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07328S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"31403","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"31403","articleId":"1458951","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1458966,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The MAP principle provides an estimate for the segmented image by maximizing the posterior probabilities of the classes defined in the image. The posterior probability can be represented as the product of the class conditional probability (CCP) and the class prior probability (CPP). In this paper, novel supervised algorithms for the CCP and the CPP estimations are proposed which are appropriate for remote sensing images where the estimation process might to be done in high-dimensional spaces. For the CCP, a supervised algorithm which uses the support vector machines (SVM) density estimation approach is proposed. This algorithm uses a novel learning procedure, derived from the main field theory, which avoids the (hard) quadratic optimization problem arising from the traditional formulation of the SVM density estimation. For the CPP estimation, Markov random field (MRF) is a common choice which incorporates contextual and geometrical information in the estimation process. Instead of using predefined values for the parameters of the MRF, an analytical algorithm is proposed which automatically identifies the values of the MRF parameters. The proposed framework is built in an iterative setup which refines the estimated image to get the optimum solution. Experiments using both synthetic and real remote sensing data (multispectral and hyperspectral) show the powerful performance of the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed density estimation algorithm outperforms other algorithms for remote sensing data over a wide range of spectral dimensions. The MRF modeling raises the segmentation accuracy by up to 10% in remote sensing images.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A unified framework for MAP estimation in remote sensing image segmentation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2005.849059","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/31405/01459027.pdf","startPage":"1617","endPage":"1634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2005.849059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31405","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1459027","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1459027/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","displayDocTitle":"A unified framework for MAP estimation in remote sensing image segmentation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/1459027/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8525368","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified framework for MAP estimation in remote sensing image segmentation","sourcePdf":"01459027.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103163S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"31405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"31405","articleId":"1459027","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1459041,"authors":[{"name":"V.

This quantity plays an important role in various contexts, including approximating marginal distributions, parameter estimation, combinatorial enumeration, statistical decision theory, and large-deviations bounds. Our derivation is based on concepts from convex duality and information geometry: in particular, it exploits mixtures of distributions in the exponential domain, and the Legendre mapping between exponential and mean parameters. In the special case of convex combinations of tree-structured distributions, we obtain a family of variational problems, similar to the Bethe variational problem, but distinguished by the following desirable properties: i) they are convex, and have a unique global optimum; and ii) the optimum gives an upper bound on the log partition function. This optimum is defined by stationary conditions very similar to those defining fixed points of the sum-product algorithm, or more generally, any local optimum of the Bethe variational problem. As with sum-product fixed points, the elements of the optimizing argument can be used as approximations to the marginals of the original model. The analysis extends naturally to convex combinations of hypertree-structured distributions, thereby establishing links to Kikuchi approximations and variants.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2005.850091","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/31406/01459045.pdf","startPage":"2313","endPage":"2335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2005.850091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new class of upper bounds on the log partition function","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1459045","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","displayDocTitle":"A new class of upper bounds on the log partition function","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1459045/","publicationDate":"July 2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8491309","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1459045/","volume":"51","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new class of upper bounds on the log partition function","sourcePdf":"01459045.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.210803S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"31406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"31406","articleId":"1459045","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1459046,"authors":[{"name":"Jianyi Huang","affiliation":["RedDot Wireless, Milpitas, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Jianyi Huang","id":"37281268700"},{"name":"S.P.

The following conclusions are obtained under general assumptions on the channel statistics. i) The capacity-achieving input distribution is binary for low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The proof is obtained on comparing the optimization equations that determine channel capacity with a linear program over the space of probability measures. ii) Simple discrete approximations can nearly reach capacity even in cases where the optimal distribution is known to be absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure. iii) A new class of algorithms is introduced based on the cutting-plane method to iteratively construct discrete distributions, along with upper and lower bounds on channel capacity. It is shown that the bounds converge to the true channel capacity, and that the distributions converge weakly to a capacity-achieving distribution.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2005.850108","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/31406/01459046.pdf","startPage":"2336","endPage":"2351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2005.850108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization and computation of optimal distributions for channel coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1459046","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1459046/","displayDocTitle":"Characterization and computation of optimal distributions for channel coding","volume":"51","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8491310","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1459046/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization and computation of optimal distributions for channel coding","sourcePdf":"01459046.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121383S","chronDate":"July  2005","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"31406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"31406","articleId":"1459046","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":1459047,"authors":[{"name":"H.D.

The new bounded complexity result is achieved by puncturing bits, and allowing in this way a sufficient number of state nodes in the Tanner graph representing the codes.

In particular, a new algebraic formulation for the diversity advantage design criterion is developed. The new criterion encompasses, as a special case, the well-known diversity advantage for unitary space-time signals and, more importantly, applies to arbitrary signaling schemes and arbitrary channel distributions. This criterion is used to establish the optimal diversity-versus-rate tradeoff for training based schemes in block-fading channels. Our results are then specialized to the class of affine space-time signals which allows for a low complexity decoder. Within this class, space-time constellations based on the threaded algebraic space-time (TAST) architecture are considered. These constellations achieve the optimal diversity-versus-rate tradeoff over noncoherent block-fading channels and outperform previously proposed codes in the considered scenarios as demonstrated by the numerical results.

In particular, we consider a setting where information about a random n-bit string X is stored in s classical or quantum bits, for s<n, i.e., the stored information is bound to be only partial. Later, a randomly chosen predicate F about X has to be guessed using only the stored information. The maximum probability of correctly guessing F(X) is then compared for the cases where the storage device is classical or quantum mechanical, respectively. We show that, despite the fact that the measurement of quantum bits can depend arbitrarily on the predicate F, the quantum advantage is negligible already for small values of the difference n-s. Our setting generalizes the setting of Ambainis et al. who considered the problem of guessing an arbitrary bit (i.e., one of the n bits) of X. An implication for cryptography is that privacy amplification by universal hashing remains essentially equally secure when the adversary's memory is allowed to be quantum rather than only classical. Since privacy amplification is a main ingredient of many quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, our result can be used to prove the security of QKD in a generic way.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2005.850087","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/31406/01459049.pdf","startPage":"2391","endPage":"2401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2005.850087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the power of quantum memory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1459049","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1459049/","displayDocTitle":"On the power of quantum memory","volume":"51","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8491313","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1459049/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the power of quantum memory","sourcePdf":"01459049.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088517S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"31406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"31406","articleId":"1459049","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1459051,"authors":[{"name":"Y.C.

This class of receivers is based on the recently proposed covariance shaping least-squares estimator, and is designed to minimize the total variance of the weighted error between the receiver output and the observed signal, subject to the constraint that the covariance of the noise component in the receiver output is proportional to a given covariance matrix, so that we control the dynamic range and spectral shape of the output noise. Some of the well-known linear multiuser receivers are shown to be special cases of the CSMU receiver. This allows us to interpret these receivers as the receivers that minimize the total error variance in the observations, among all linear receivers with the same output noise covariance, and to analyze their performance in a unified way. We derive exact and approximate expressions for the probability of bit error, as well as the asymptotic signal-to-interference+noise ratio in the large system limit. We also characterize the spectral efficiency versus energy-per-information bit of the CSMU receiver in the wideband regime. Finally, we consider a special case of the CSMU receiver, equivalent to a mismatched minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) receiver, in which the channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is not known precisely. Using our general performance analysis results, we characterize the performance of the mismatched MMSE receiver. We then treat the case in which the SNR is known to lie in a given uncertainty range, and develop a robust mismatched MMSE receiver whose performance is very close to that of the MMSE receiver over the entire uncertainty range.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2005.850049","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31406","startPage":"2426","endPage":"2446","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/31406/01459051.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A covariance shaping framework for linear multiuser detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1459051/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1459051/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A covariance shaping framework for linear multiuser detection","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8491315","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"51","issue":"7","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A covariance shaping framework for linear multiuser detection","sourcePdf":"01459051.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097764S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"31406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"31406","articleId":"1459051","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1459054,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

For the low- and high-SNR regions, in turn, we uncover compact capacity expansions that are valid for arbitrary numbers of antennas and that shed insight on how antenna correlation impacts the tradeoffs among power, bandwidth, and rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1459054/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","volume":"51","issue":"7","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8491318","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","publicationDate":"July 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1459054/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Impact of antenna correlation on the capacity of multiantenna channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of antenna correlation on the capacity of multiantenna channels","sourcePdf":"01459054.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.173725S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"31406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"267","xplore-issue":"31406","articleId":"1459054","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1459058,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This is a natural question about a fundamental object connected to many fields such as data compression, Kolmogorov complexity, pattern identification, and addition chains. Due to the problem's inherent complexity, our objective is to find an approximation algorithm which finds a small grammar for the input string. We focus attention on the approximation ratio of the algorithm (and implicitly, the worst case behavior) to establish provable performance guarantees and to address shortcomings in the classical measure of redundancy in the literature. Our first results are concern the hardness of approximating the smallest grammar problem. Most notably, we show that every efficient algorithm for the smallest grammar problem has approximation ratio at least 8569/8568 unless P=NP. We then bound approximation ratios for several of the best known grammar-based compression algorithms, including LZ78, B ISECTION, SEQUENTIAL, LONGEST MATCH, GREEDY, and RE-PAIR. Among these, the best upper bound we show is O(n/sup 1/2/). We finish by presenting two novel algorithms with exponentially better ratios of O(log/sup 3/n) and O(log(n/m/sup */)), where m/sup */ is the size of the smallest grammar for that input. The latter algorithm highlights a connection between grammar-based compression and LZ77.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2005.850116","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/31406/01459058.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2005.850116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31406","startPage":"2554","endPage":"2576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The smallest grammar problem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1459058","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The smallest grammar problem","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1459058/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"51","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8491322","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1459058/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The smallest grammar problem","sourcePdf":"01459058.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127694S","chronDate":"July  2005","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"31406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"209","xplore-issue":"31406","articleId":"1459058","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":1459059,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

However, for delay-tolerable applications, it is unnecessary to maintain the SIR at a certain level all the time. To maximize throughput, one should increase one's power when the interference level is low, and the information transmission rate is adjusted accordingly by adaptive modulation and coding techniques. This approach is called opportunistic communications. In this paper, we generalize Yates' result and establish a new framework, which is applicable to systems supporting opportunistic communications and with heterogeneous service requirements. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm yields significant improvement in throughput when compared with the conventional target tracking approach.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2005.850045","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/31406/01459062.pdf","startPage":"2625","endPage":"2635","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2005.850045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A generalized framework for distributed power control in wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1459062","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1459062/","displayDocTitle":"A generalized framework for distributed power control in wireless networks","volume":"51","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8491326","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1459062/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A generalized framework for distributed power control in wireless networks","sourcePdf":"01459062.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106201S","chronDate":"July  2005","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"31406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"31406","articleId":"1459062","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1459063,"authors":[{"name":"V.

A general asymmetric MPR model is introduced and the medium-access control (MAC) capacity region is specified. An explicit characterization of the ALOHA stability region for the two-user system is given. It is shown that the stability region undergoes a phase transition from a concave region to a convex polyhedral region as the MPR capability improves. It is also shown that after this phase transition, slotted ALOHA is optimal i.e., the ALOHA stability region coincides with the MAC capacity region. Further, it is observed that there is no need for transmission control when ALOHA is optimal i.e., ALOHA with transmission probability one is optimal. Next, these results are extended to a symmetric N>2 user ALOHA system. Finally, a complete characterization of average delay in capture channels for the two-user system is given. It is shown that in certain capture scenarios, ALOHA with transmission probability one is delay optimal for all stable arrival rates. Further, it is also shown that ALOHA with transmission probability one is optimal for stability and delay simultaneously in the two-user capture channel.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2005.850060","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/31406/01459063.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2005.850060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31406","startPage":"2636","endPage":"2656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability and delay of finite-user slotted ALOHA with multipacket reception","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1459063","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stability and delay of finite-user slotted ALOHA with multipacket reception","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1459063/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"51","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8491327","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1459063/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability and delay of finite-user slotted ALOHA with multipacket reception","sourcePdf":"01459063.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094946S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"31406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"220","xplore-issue":"31406","articleId":"1459063","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1459064,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Xu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Broadband Optical Transmission and Communication Network, School of Communication andInformation Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China","Department of Electrical andComputer Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA"],"lastName":"Bo Xu","id":"37334702400"},{"name":"M.

We study LDPC codes for channels with nonuniform noise distributions, rate-adaptive coding, and unequal error protection. First, we propose a technique to design LDPC codes for volume holographic memory (VHM) systems for which the noise distribution is nonuniform. We show that the proposed coding scheme has an easy design procedure and results in efficient codes for holographic memories. An important property of the proposed technique is the design of the codes that have a low error floor and low variable node degrees, while maintaining performance close to the Shannon limit. We then show that punctured LDPC codes can be studied as a special case of our design methodology for nonuniform channels. Finally, we propose a method to generate LDPC codes that can provide unequal error protection in addition to having a good overall performance. Moreover, the highly protected bits can be decoded without requiring the entire word to be decoded.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2005.850230","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/31406/01459071.pdf","startPage":"2702","endPage":"2714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2005.850230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonuniform error correction using low-density parity-check codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1459071","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Nonuniform error correction using low-density parity-check codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1459071/","publicationDate":"July 2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8491335","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1459071/","volume":"51","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonuniform error correction using low-density parity-check codes","sourcePdf":"01459071.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135801S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"31406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"31406","articleId":"1459071","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1459072,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Using the devices in the key circuit blocks for typical RF transceivers, we review and give trends for the FoMs that characterize active and passive RF devices. These FoMs include transit frequency at unity current gain f/sub T/, maximum frequency of oscillation f/sub MAX/ at unit power gain, noise, breakdown voltage, capacitor density, varactor and inductor quality, and the like. We use the specifications for wireless communications systems to show how different Si-based devices may achieve acceptable FoMs. We focus on Si complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS), Si Bipolar CMOS, and Si bipolar devices, including SiGe heterojunction bipolar transistors, RF devices, and integrated circuits (ICs). We analyze trends in the FoMs for Si-based RF devices and ICs and show how these trends relate to the technology nodes of the 2003 International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors. We also compare FoMs for the best reported performance of research devices and for the performance of devices manufactured in high volumes, typically more than 10 000 devices.

In this paper, we review recent advances in interconnect schemes that promise to meet all of the above system requirements. Unlike traditional wired interconnects based solely on time-division multiple access for data transmission, these new interconnect schemes facilitate the use of additional multiple access techniques including code-division multiple access and frequency-division multiple access to greatly increase bandwidth and channel concurrency as well as to reduce channel latency. The physical transmission line is no longer limited to a direct-coupled metal wire. Rather, it can be accomplished via either wired or wireless mediums through capacitor couplers that reduce the baseband noise and dc power consumption while simplifying the fabrication process by eliminating vertical metal studs needed in three-dimensional ICs. These new advances in interconnect schemes would fundamentally alter the paradigm of ULSI data communications and enable the design of next-generation computing/processing systems.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2005.850699","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31407/01459085.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2005.850699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31407","startPage":"1271","endPage":"1285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced RF/baseband interconnect schemes for inter- and intra-ULSI communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1459085","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Advanced RF/baseband interconnect schemes for inter- and intra-ULSI communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1459085/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8534788","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1459085/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced RF/baseband interconnect schemes for inter- and intra-ULSI communications","sourcePdf":"01459085.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1485S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"31407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"31407","articleId":"1459085","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1459087,"authors":[{"name":"A.Z.H.

Firstly, the impact of technology scaling on the noise and linearity of the low-noise amplifier (LNA) is thoroughly analyzed. Then two new circuits, i.e., CMOS complementary parallel push-pull (CCPP) circuit and vertical-NPN (V-NPN) circuit for direct-conversion receiver (DCR), are introduced. In CCPP, the high RF performance of pMOS comparable to nMOS provides single ended differential RF signal processing capability without the use of a bulky balun. The use of parasitic V-NPN bipolar transistor, available in triple well CMOS technology, has shown to provide more than an order of magnitude improvement in 1/f noise and dc offset related problems, which have been the bottleneck for CMOS single chip integration. Then CMOS technology scaling for various passive device performances such as the inductor, varactor, MIM capacitor, and switched capacitor, is discussed. Both the forward scaling of the active devices and the inverse scaling of interconnection layer, i.e., more interconnection layers with effectively thicker total dielectric and metal layers, provide very favorable scenario for all passive devices. Finally, the impact of CMOS scaling on the various digital circuits is introduced, taking the digital modem blocks, the various digital calibration circuits, the switching RF power amplifier, and eventually the software defined radio, as examples.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2005.850632","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31407/01459100.pdf","startPage":"1415","endPage":"1422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2005.850632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The impact of semiconductor technology scaling on CMOS RF and digital circuits for wireless application","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1459100","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1459100/","displayDocTitle":"The impact of semiconductor technology scaling on CMOS RF and digital circuits for wireless application","volume":"52","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8534803","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1459100/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The impact of semiconductor technology scaling on CMOS RF and digital circuits for wireless application","sourcePdf":"01459100.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123577S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"31407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"31407","articleId":"1459100","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1459102,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The energy exists as a very small charge (4 nC) at high voltage (300 V). An initial proposal for power processing used a carefully scaled lateral power MOSFET-diode pair, which results in a low, but sufficient, energy yield. It was found that increasing the area of the MOSFET to reduce conduction loss is highly detrimental to the energy yield because of capacitive loading of the generator. This paper examines alternative device topologies which may greatly increase the energy yield for a given system size by increasing both the generation efficiency and the conversion efficiency. An insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT) and a MOS-triggered thyristor, both based on previous silicon-on-insulator MOSFET designs, are examined for their switching speed and losses using physics-based finite-element simulation. The scaling criteria to achieve optimum system effectiveness are discussed. The small charge available from the generator results in a brief conduction period which does not allow the devices to reach their steady-state carrier distributions. Nevertheless the IGBT, and especially the MOS-triggered thyristor, switch on faster than the MOSFET, run at higher current densities, and provide improved efficiency. This allows the devices to be reduced in area leading to less capacitive loading on the generator. It also allows a reduction in the value and volume of the circuit inductor without a conduction loss penalty. We describe the device behavior in detail for the various phases of the conversion cycle and illustrate device/circuit tradeoffs graphically. Requirements are outlined for the development of power devices for microgenerators in implanted medical sensors.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2005.850940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31407","startPage":"1640","endPage":"1648","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31407/01459131.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of SOI power device structures in power converters for high-voltage, low-charge electrostatic microgenerators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1459131/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1459131/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparison of SOI power device structures in power converters for high-voltage, low-charge electrostatic microgenerators","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8534833","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"52","issue":"7","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of SOI power device structures in power converters for high-voltage, low-charge electrostatic microgenerators","sourcePdf":"01459131.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0759S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"31407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"31407","articleId":"1459131","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1459135,"authors":[{"name":"Y.P.

The design was made using the Zeland IE3D software package. The fabrication was realized with the back-end-of-line process of silicon substrates of low resistivity 10 /spl Omega//spl middot/cm. The characterization was conducted on wafer with Cascade Microtech coplanar probes and an HP8510XF network analyzer. The results show that the inverted-F antenna achieved a minimum return loss of 32 dB and a gain of -19 dBi at 61 GHz; while the quasi-Yagi antenna achieved a minimum return loss of 6.75 dB and a gain of -12.5 dBi at 65 GHz.

However, due to the use of explicit march-in-time schemes, their time steps are limited not only by the modeling accuracy but also by the Courant-Friedrich-Levy (CFL) stability condition. This CFL condition poses quite a significant restriction on the application of the FDTD methods to a number of problems, in particular those requiring highly non-uniform grids. In this talk, we present an overview of the two unconditionally stable FDTD schemes that have been developed in recent years. The first one is the alternating-direction-implicit (ADI) FDTD method and the second one is the FDTD method using Laguerre polynomials. We show the principles of these two methods and analyze the associated errors and the techniques to improve them. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of the two methods by showing their applications such as computation of conducting loss and a PEC slot.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unconditionally stable finite-difference time-domain methods and their applications","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Although the higher order approaches have the distinct advantages of higher accuracy and faster convergence, some recognized inherent deficiencies of leading to larger condition numbers of FEM matrices have limited them in the use of iterative methods. A rectangular resonator cavity is considered and the eigenvalue matrix equation is obtained by FEM where the higher order hexahedral vector basis functions are employed to expand the unknown field. The condition numbers of two stiffness matrices resulting from the eigenvalue equation are analyzed with respect to different higher order bases.

The FDTD method is used to calculate the temporal response of EM fields inside the structure due to a Gaussian incident plane wave and then a frequency domain response is obtained via a discrete Fourier transform. In the next step, we assign a TF to each point by dividing its frequency response by the frequency response of the Gaussian incident wave.. This TF can be used to predict the response of the system to any other temporal waveforms with a frequency content near to the input's frequency content. Thus, once we pay the cost of a long-time memory-consuming numerical calculation to obtain the exact solution of the field distribution inside the structure, due to a proper input (Gaussian pulse), we can come up with a very simple and fast way to predict the answer to other similar inputs.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Wideband wireless systems based on OFDM are limited in their performance by the dips in the frequency spectrum of the multipath fading channel. Channel estimation is not only useful for demodulation of the transmitted data but also for implementing the loading scheme for the transmitter, since the performance of an OFDM-based system can be augmented by the adaptive loading and power allocation of the subcarriers. We simulated two kinds of channel estimation schemes and an adaptive loading algorithm, and compared the effects of the channel estimation for loading gain. Simulation shows that the loading gain of the adaptive algorithm can be improved ulteriorly through better channel estimation.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The module's modulation rate can reach 150 Mbps in L band, or 600 Mbps in X band. Compared to the conventional QPSK, the main difference of OQPSK is that its Q-channel digits lag behind the I-channel digits by one half symbol. Thus, OQPSK avoids the 180/spl deg/ phase transitions and therefore has the better power spectrum. The direct modulation in RF is also superior to the conventional IF modulation in terms of structure and reliability. The paper also introduces a time-series analysis method, signal integrity simulation and some design fundamentals for high-speed printed circuit boards involved in the module.","doi":"10.1109/ICCEA.2004.1459352","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Different from the conventional QAM, NLA-16SQAM signals are generated by combining two SQPSK signals. First, a serial data stream is split into four parallel streams that form two in-phase and quadrature phase signal pairs. Then the quadrature phase digit signals are set to lag behind the in-phase signals by one half symbol. Each pair of signals is converted from absolute codes into relative codes, and then sent into a SQPSK modulator. Two SQPSK output signals are amplified by their own saturated power amplifier, producing a 6 dB difference in their voltage levels, and they are then sent into a power synthesizer to obtain the NLA-16QAM signals. Not only can the NLA-16SQAM modulation module improve spectral efficiency, but it can also make the best of the precious energy on satellites.","doi":"10.1109/ICCEA.2004.1459353","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Firstly, the paper deduces and analyzes the relationship between the EVM and the phase noise density of the PLL. Several key equations are discussed and an EVM simulation program is written which can be used together with a PLL simulation program for accurate PLL parameter determination based on the EVM specification.

In these waveguides, the incident propagating wave undergoes reflection in an interaction with the end-facet. As a result of the discontinuity, all possible propagating modes may be excited.

OFDM system shows many favorable property such as high spectral efficiency, robustness to channel fading and immunity to impulse interference. However, there are some obstacles in using OFDM in transmission system, which is in contrast to its advantages. One of the major drawbacks is a very high peak to average power ratio (PAPR) of the OFDM signals. Therefore this paper analyzes the capability of code repetition (CR) to reduce PAPR in WLAN/OFDM system. The analysis is on a network model designed by WLAN 802.11a standard using Matlab, a mathematical simulation software tool. The network model has been simulated in AWGN channel environment to investigate the behavior of PAPR and BER performance. The proposed technique to reduce PAPR in the WLAN/OFDM channel coding consists of two part; convolutional code and CR. Simulation model with different number of repetition has been analyzed and the results were compared with the conventional coded OFDM (COFDM). The simulation results show that the proposed technique based on CR reduces PAPR down to 5 dB compared to COFDM model.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR reduction in WLAN-OFDM system using code repetition technique","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Considerations in the use of fault current limiter are that it must be reliable in operation, compact and inexpensive. This paper presents a comprehensive performance evaluation on the use of solid-state fault current limiters (FCL) in a distribution system. The FCL simulation model has been developed using the electromagnetic transient program PSCAD/EMTDC and a new control strategy for the FCL has been proposed for instantaneous detection of over current. The FCL is evaluated in terms of its performance in limiting fault current to the tolerable limit of the system, as well as the response of the FCL within a fraction of a cycle of about 2 ms. The effects of varying circuit parameters such as R, L, and C as part of the FCL device has been investigated. It has been noted that the inductive reactor, which is part of the FCL device, is suitable for limiting the fault current. The impact of induction motor loads on the FCL has also been analyzed. Simulation results show that the FCL is effective for reducing short circuit currents and also can be used to protect bus bars from voltage sag when the system is subjected to various types of faults.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1459700/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 Aug. 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"2003","accessionNumber":"8478342","htmlLink":"/document/1459700/","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2005","conferenceDate":"25-26 Aug. 2003","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of solid state fault current limiters in electric distribution system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of solid state fault current limiters in electric distribution system","confLoc":"Putrajaya, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"01459700.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040434S","chronDate":"25-26 Aug. 2003","xplore-pub-id":"9885","isNumber":"31418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9885","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"31418","articleId":"1459700","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1459713,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The objective of feature selection and extraction is to speed up the NN training process and to achieve a more accurate NN results. The proposed method is known as the SDFT method in which it is a combination of the sensitivity and discrete Fourier transform methods. The sensitivity analysis is first used in selecting the input features and then followed by the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) method for extracting NN input features. The hypothesis set of pre-selected data performed by the sensitivity method only offers no improvement in the NN training performance in such cases where many features are highly correlated. Thus, the DFT method is considered so as to extract the pre-selected data to a set of meaningful extracted data. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a comparative study of the SDFT, DFT and sensitivity methods is made so as to investigate the effectiveness of the methods in extracting and selecting the NN features. In this study, the NN based available transfer capability assessment has been performed on the Malaysian power system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 Aug. 2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1459731/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8478356","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1459731/","publicationDate":"2003","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2005","conferenceDate":"25-26 Aug. 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A novel feature selection and extraction method for neural network based transfer capability assessment of power systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel feature selection and extraction method for neural network based transfer capability assessment of power systems","confLoc":"Putrajaya, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"01459731.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074337S","chronDate":"25-26 Aug. 2003","xplore-pub-id":"9885","isNumber":"31418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9885","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"31418","articleId":"1459731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1459756,"authors":[{"name":"M.D. McKinley","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"M.D.","lastName":"McKinley","id":"37326134100"},{"name":"Youngcheol Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"lastName":"Youngcheol Park","id":"37087160452"},{"name":"J.

In this paper we have extended J-Sim - an open-source, component-based compositional network simulation environment - with the model checking capability to explore the state space created by a network protocol until either the entire state space is explored (if the state space is finite) or an error (e.g., a violation of a user-defined safety assertion) is discovered. We also exploit protocol-specific properties in the process of exploring the state space, to reduce the size of the state space and to guide the (best-first) search towards paths that can potentially locate errors in less time. As a proof of concept, we have demonstrated use of the J-Sim model checker in locating errors in an automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocol. As compared to the Maude LTL model checker, the J-Sim model checker can locate errors in a timely manner and with shorter error traces.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Check and simulate: a case for incorporating model checking in network simulation","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

We introduce for probabilistic parallel programs with shared variables, message passing via synchronous and (perfect or lossy) fifo channels and atomic regions and provide a structured operational semantics. Applied to finite-state systems, the semantics can serve as basis for the algorithmic generation of a Markov decision process that models the stepwise behavior of the given system.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Series compensation of transmission lines connected to turbogenerators can result in subsynchronous resonance (SSR) leading to adverse torsional oscillations. The use of flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) controllers like static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) are increasing in the network for enhancing power transfer capability, dynamic voltage support and also damping of power oscillations. Many countermeasures to SSR problem have been reported in the literature, which makes use of signals available at the generator station. In this paper, the damping of subsynchronous oscillations using STATCOM, which is provided at the middle of the transmission line, is presented. The effectiveness of an auxiliary signal designated as computed internal angle (CIA), which modulates the voltage reference of STATCOM, is investigated. The auxiliary signal CIA is synthesized by local measurements of voltage and line current at the STATCOM bus. The IEEE second benchmark model is considered for the analysis. The analysis of SSR is carried out using eigenvalue analysis and results obtained are validated by transient simulation using MATLAB-SIMULINK.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31408","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPST.2004.1459958","publicationTitle":"2004 International Conference on Power System Technology, 2004.
