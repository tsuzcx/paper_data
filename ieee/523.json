The algorithm can be divided into two phases: image reconstruction and recognition on micro-calcification regions. For Phase I, the suspicious micro-calcification regions are separated from the normal tissues by wavelet layers and Renyi's information theory. The Morphology-Dilation and Majority Voting Rule are employed to reconstruct the scattered regions of suspicious micro-calcification. For Phase II, total 49 descriptors which mainly includes shape inertia, compactness, eccentricity and grey-level co-occurrence matrix are introduced to define the characteristics of the suspicious micro-calcification clusters. In order to reduce the computation load, principal component analysis is used to transform these descriptors to a compact but efficient expression by linear combination method. The performance of proposed diagnosis algorithm is verified by intensive experiments upon realistic clinic patients. The efficacy of back-propagation neural network classifier exhibits its superiority in terms of high true positive rate(TP rate) and low false positive(FP rate) rate, in comparison to Bayes classifier.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5230014/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10864894","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5230014/","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2009","conferenceDate":"14-17 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Quantitative analysis of micro-calcifications for breast cancer via wavelet transform and neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantitative analysis of micro-calcifications for breast cancer via wavelet transform and neural network","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"rp0036-0094.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060121S","chronDate":"14-17 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5211950","isNumber":"5229709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5211950","xplore-issue":"5229709","articleId":"5230014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5230015,"authors":[{"name":"Shun Nishide","affiliation":["Department of Intelligence Science and Technology, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Shun","lastName":"Nishide","id":"37564244200"},{"name":"Tetsuya Ogata","affiliation":["Department of Intelligence Science and Technology, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuya","lastName":"Ogata","id":"37273829100"},{"name":"Jun Tani","affiliation":["Brain Science Institute, RIKEN, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Tani","id":"37281617800"},{"name":"Kazunori Komatani","affiliation":["Department of Intelligence Science and Technology, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazunori","lastName":"Komatani","id":"37273821000"},{"name":"Hiroshi G.

In most of applications, neural networks are often implemented in software form. Although the software implementation of neural networks provides flexibility, the computation speed is limited due to the sequential machine architecture. In most applications using artificial neural networks, the learning procedure is carried off-line. A large amount of mathematic operations are needed when learning task of neural networks is performed. The software implementation of neural network systems can only work well using high performance computers. The learning performance is not adequate when it is implemented on embedded systems. Following the development of modern semiconductor technologies, people attempt to realize the neural networks by hardware in order to improve the performance. Designs utilizing special architectures and parameters to achieve the performance were proposed in the past. This paper proposes a high efficiency and generic neural network hardware architecture. The architecture uses the toroidal series multiple data stream to process the back propagation neural network operations, which has the full function of recall and learning capabilities. Users can adjust the number of processor elements (PEs) in the system based on the requirement of the applications by setting the values in registers. Since the proposed system is developed in hardware, it can be integrated into embedded systems easily. The experimental results show that the system can reach much higher performance by using fewer logical elements while maintaining flexibility","doi":"10.1109/AIM.2009.5230017","startPage":"180","endPage":"185","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5211950/5229709/05230017.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIM.2009.5230017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5229709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of high performance hardware based toroidal neural network with learning capability","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural network hardware","Neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Application software","Learning","Computer networks","Computer architecture","Embedded system","Artificial intelligence","Mathematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","embedded systems","neural net architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware based toroidal neural network","learning capability","artificial intelligence application domains","software implementation","sequential machine architecture","artificial neural networks","learning procedure","mathematic operations","high performance computers","embedded systems","modern semiconductor technologies","neural network hardware architecture","back propagation neural network operations","processor elements"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5230017/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of high performance hardware based toroidal neural network with learning capability","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5230017/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2009","conferenceDate":"14-17 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10864897","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of high performance hardware based toroidal neural network with learning capability","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"rp0031-0027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05815S","chronDate":"14-17 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5211950","isNumber":"5229709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5211950","xplore-issue":"5229709","articleId":"5230017","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5230018,"authors":[{"name":"Ting-Kai Liu","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Guidance Engineering, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ting-Kai","lastName":"Liu","id":"37900354800"},{"name":"Jih-Gau Juang","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Guidance Engineering, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jih-Gau","lastName":"Juang","id":"37339750100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2852-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2853-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2854-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6247"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6255"}],"articleNumber":"5230018","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":605},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Three-term control","Control systems","MIMO","Transmission line measurements","Intelligent control","Propellers","Attitude control","Azimuth","Tail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","intelligent control","MIMO systems","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","propellers","rotors","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single neuron PID control","twin rotor MIMO system","intelligent control scheme","twin rotor multiinput multioutput system","propeller","controller design","nonlinear movement","main rotor","tail rotor"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an intelligent control scheme which utilizes a single neuron PID controller to an experimental propeller setup called the twin rotor multi-input multi-output system (TRMS).

The two-stage paradigm adopts a decision tree and a maximum entropy model to identify the potential story boundaries in the broadcast news within a sliding window. The problem for story segmentation is thus transformed to the determination of a boundary position sequence from the potential boundary regions. A genetic algorithm is then applied to determine the chromosome, which corresponds to the final boundary position sequence. A topic-based segmental model is proposed to define the fitness function applied in the genetic algorithm. The syllable- and word-based story segmentation schemes are adopted to evaluate the proposed approach. Experimental results indicate that a miss probability of 0.1587 and a false alarm probability of 0.0859 are achieved for story segmentation on the collected broadcast news corpus. On the TDT-3 Mandarin audio corpus, a miss probability of 0.1232 and a false alarm probability of 0.1298 are achieved.

In the staggered fusion process, four CMOS images were taken staggeringly in half pixel offset in directions of horizontal, vertical and diagonal and then were composed into one image. Theoretical analysis about the relations of pixel gray-level of original multi-images taken by CMOS image sensor and the reconstructed new image proved that resolution of the reconstructed new image of CMOS sensor can be raised by 4 times than the original images. In the simulation experiments done afterwards we did get the higher resolution reconstructed image from lower resolution images. The experimental results verify the theory analysis well. It indicated that the staggered fusion imaging method is promising for the future development of higher performance and lower price CMOS image sensors.","doi":"10.1109/SOPO.2009.5230210","publicationTitle":"2009 Symposium on Photonics and Optoelectronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Symposium on Photonics and Optoelectronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230049/5230050/05230210.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOPO.2009.5230210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5230050","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of Staggered Fusion Imaging Principle of CMOS Image Sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5230210","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Study of Staggered Fusion Imaging Principle of CMOS Image Sensor","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5230210/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10862870","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5230210/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of Staggered Fusion Imaging Principle of CMOS Image Sensor","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"02-51.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057061S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230049","isNumber":"5230050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230049","xplore-issue":"5230050","articleId":"5230210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5230240,"authors":[{"name":"Zhihua Zheng","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhihua","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37406263500"},{"name":"Zongjue Qian","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zongjue","lastName":"Qian","id":"37402896200"},{"name":"Guochu Shou","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guochu","lastName":"Shou","id":"37396578900"},{"name":"Yihong Hu","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yihong","lastName":"Hu","id":"37403245800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4412-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-8464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-8480"}],"articleNumber":"5230240","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":266},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel allocation","Passive optical networks","Digital signal processing","OFDM","Optical network units","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Optical signal processing","Optical transmitters","Optical fiber networks","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","digital signal processing chips","frequency division multiple access","optical fibre networks","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["passive optical networks","OFDMA system","dynamic bandwidth allocation","orthogonal frequency division multiple access system","digital signal processing","PON system","quadrature amplitude modulation","fiber transmission"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5230240","abstract":"A scheme on orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system with dynamic bandwidth allocation is investigated in passive optical networks (PONs).

When the response is strongly sparse, convergence of conventional approaches is poor. Drawing on techniques originally developed for network echo cancellation (NEC), we propose a class of AEC algorithms that can not only work well in both sparse and dispersive circumstances, but also adapt dynamically to the level of sparseness using a new sparseness-controlled approach. Simulation results, using white Gaussian noise (WGN) and speech input signals, show improved performance over existing methods. The proposed algorithms achieve these improvement with only a modest increase in computational complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Class of Sparseness-Controlled Algorithms for Echo Cancellation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2009.2025903","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5200684/05230333.pdf","startPage":"1591","endPage":"1601","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2009.2025903","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200684","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5230333","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5230333/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Class of Sparseness-Controlled Algorithms for Echo Cancellation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5230333/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10847402","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Class of Sparseness-Controlled Algorithms for Echo Cancellation","sourcePdf":"17tasl07-pnaylor-2025903.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.313507S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5200684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5200684","articleId":"5230333","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5230344,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Grossi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering (D.E.I.S.), University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Marco Grossi received the Laurea degree in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy, in 2000 and 2004, respectively.","He is currently involved in projects of innovative sensors for bacterial detection in food products and the characterization of food samples by electrical impedance spectroscopy."]},"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Grossi","id":"37284294400"},{"name":"Anna Pompei","affiliation":["Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Anna Pompei received the Degree in biology and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy, in 2000 and 2006, respectively.","She is currently involved in the research of innovative techniques in hygiene quality control for bacterial detection in food products, isolation and characterization of micro organisms to employ in functional food."]},"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Pompei","id":"37886225700"},{"name":"Massimo Lanzoni","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering (D.E.I.S.), University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Massimo Lanzoni (M'87) received the Degree in electronic engineering from the from the University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy, in 1987.","He is an Associate Professor of Electronics since 2001 and is involved in projects concerning sensor design, characterization and development of virtual instruments, and sensors for biological applications."]},"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Lanzoni","id":"37284293700"},{"name":"Roberto Lazzarini","affiliation":["Carpigiani Group, Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Roberto Lazzarini graduated with a Degree in nuclear engineering from the from the University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.","He has broad international experience in the food equipment sector and is (co-) author of publications and several international patents.

On the other hand, detection of bacterial concentration by means of classic impedance microbiology is very attractive due to faster response time (4-14 h versus 24-72 h for the SPC) and easy implementation in industrial machines. Recently, an impedance technique for the detection of bacterial concentration has been introduced that avoids diluting media, thus resulting much simpler to implement in automatic form than existing alternatives. In this paper, various soft-frozen dairy products of different composition and producers have been tested to study the correlation between conventional SPC and such a new impedance technique.

The visual framework presented in this paper enables deployment of the vehicle in underwater environments along with a human scuba diver as the operator, without requiring any external tethered control. We present the current implementation of this framework in our particular family of underwater robots, with a focus on the underlying software and hardware infrastructure. We look at the practical issues pertaining to system implementation as it applies to our framework, from choice of operating systems to communication bus design. While our system has been effectively used in both open-ocean andclosed-water environments, we perform some quantitative measurements with an effort to analyze the responsiveness and robustness of the complete architecture.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Canadian Conference on Computer and Robot Vision","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230490/5230491/05230500.pdf","startPage":"329","endPage":"336","publicationTitle":"2009 Canadian Conference on Computer and Robot Vision","doi":"10.1109/CRV.2009.18","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CRV.2009.18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5230491","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5230500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Vision-Based Control and Interaction Framework for a Legged Underwater Robot","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Legged locomotion","Robot vision systems","Mobile robots","Robot control","Human robot interaction","Navigation","Underwater vehicles","Communication system control","Hardware","Operating systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Vision-based robotics","visual human-robot interaction","HRI","underwater robots","robot hardware and software systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5230500/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Vision-Based Control and Interaction Framework for a Legged Underwater Robot","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5230500/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2009","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Vision-Based Control and Interaction Framework for a Legged Underwater Robot","confLoc":"Kelowna, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"3651a329.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069804S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230490","isNumber":"5230491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230490","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5230491","articleId":"5230500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5230507,"authors":[{"name":"Yogesh Girdhar","affiliation":["McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Yogesh","lastName":"Girdhar","id":"37546414900"},{"name":"Gregory Dudek","affiliation":["McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Gregory","lastName":"Dudek","id":"37274057100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4211-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3651-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5230507","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":274},"abstract":"The problem of online sampling of data, can be seen as a generalization of the classical secretary problem.

In order to grasp this metric by active measurement while imposing a lower load, various estimation techniques have been proposed.

Conventional history-based estimation techniques target a wired environment and estimate temporally. By contrast, we target a wireless environment and estimate spatially. For TCP throughput estimation using lightweight probing, we propose a new modeling whereby TCP throughput is determined by capacity and delay fluctuation. We evaluate our proposed modeling by conducting experiments in a commercial CDMA2000 1x EV-DO network.

GA is adopted to optimize irregular ellipse and regular ellipse characteristics of the lip and eye features in each emotion respectively. That is, the top portion of lip configuration is a part of one ellipse and the bottom of different ellipse. Two ellipse based fitness equations are proposed for the lip configuration and relevant parameters that define the emotion are listed. One ellipse based fitness function is proposed for eye. The GA method approach has achieved reasonably successful classification of emotion. While performing classification, optimized values can mess or overlap with other emotions range. In order to overcome the overlapping problem between the emotions and at the same time to improve the classification, a neural network (NN) approach is implemented. The GA-NN based process exhibits a range of 83% - 90% classification of the emotion from the optimized feature of top lip, bottom lip and eye.","doi":"10.1109/VIZ.2009.54","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230694/5230695/05230751.pdf","startPage":"224","endPage":"228","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference in Visualisation","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference in Visualisation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VIZ.2009.54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5230695","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Personalized Human Emotion Classification Using Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5230751/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Personalized Human Emotion Classification Using Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10864212","publicationDate":"July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5230751/","conferenceDate":"15-17 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Personalized Human Emotion Classification Using Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"3734a224.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046802S","chronDate":"15-17 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230694","isNumber":"5230695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230694","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5230695","articleId":"5230751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5230801,"authors":[{"name":"Geoffrey Blake","affiliation":["University of Michigan, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Geoffrey Blake (blakeg@umich.edu) received his B.S.E. degree in computer engineering and his M.S.E. degree in computer science and engineering from the University of Michigan, where he is also a Ph.D. candidate.

One reason for this is that there is now a lot of focus on tooling in academia and also a willingness on the part of users to accept new programming paradigms. This industry-wide effort will have an effect on the way multicore DSPs are programmed and perhaps architected. But it is too early to say in what way this will occur. Programming multicore DSPs remains very challenging. The problem of how to take a piece of sequential code and optimally partition it across multiple cores remains unsolved. Hence, there will naturally be a lot of variations in the approaches taken. Equally important is the issue of debugging and visibility. Developing effective and easy-to-use code development and real-time debug tools is tremendously important as the opportunity for bugs goes up significantly when one starts to deal with both time and space. The markets that DSP plays in have unique features in their desire for low power, low cost, and hard real-time processing, with an emphasis on mathematical computation. How well the multicore research being performed presently in academia will address these concerns remains to be seen.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2009.934113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5230792","startPage":"38","endPage":"49","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/5230792/05230802.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trends in multicore DSP platforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5230802/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5230802/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Trends in multicore DSP platforms","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2009","accessionNumber":"10976123","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"26","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trends in multicore DSP platforms","sourcePdf":"26msp06-alkamal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074868S","chronDate":"November  2009","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"5230792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"5230792","articleId":"5230802","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5230807,"authors":[{"name":"Hahn Kim","affiliation":["Embedded Digital Systems Group, Technology Lincoln Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Hahn Kim (hgk@ll.mit.edu) is an associate staff member in the Embedded Digital Systems Group at Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory.

The focus is on Intel-compatible multicores, but we also discuss the IBM Cell and, briefly, graphics processing units (GPUs). The performance optimization is broken down into three key challenges: parallelization, vectorization, and memory hierarchy optimization. In each case, we use the Kronecker product formalism to formally derive the necessary algorithmic transformations based on a few hardware parameters. Further code-level optimizations are discussed. The rigorous nature of this framework enables the complete automation of the implementation task as shown by the program generator Spiral. Finally, we show and analyze DFT benchmarks of the fastest libraries available for the considered platforms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/5230792/05230808.pdf","startPage":"90","endPage":"102","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2009.934155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2009.934155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5230792","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5230808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete fourier transform on multicore","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","Multicore processing","Signal processing algorithms","Libraries","Spirals","Central Processing Unit","Instruction sets","Discrete transforms","Graphics","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","discrete Fourier transforms","matrix algebra","parallel architectures","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transform","multicore performance","multicore systems","Intel-compatible multicores","IBM Cell","graphics processing units","GPU","memory hierarchy optimization","Kronecker product formalism","code-level optimizations","Spiral","DFT","program generator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5230808/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"Discrete fourier transform on multicore","volume":"26","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5230808/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2009","accessionNumber":"10976126","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete fourier transform on multicore","sourcePdf":"26msp06-franchetti.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088899S","chronDate":"November  2009","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"5230792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5230792","articleId":"5230808","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5230811,"authors":[{"name":"Kisun You","affiliation":["Seoul National University, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, KR"],"bio":{"p":["Kisun You (kisun.you@ieee.org) received his B.S. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from Seoul National University, Korea, in 2002, where he is currently a Ph.D. candidate.

Emphasis has been given to the problem of spreading code optimization in CDMA systems, a research topic that has attracted the interest of many researchers for years, and some space has also been devoted to other applications of waveform adaptation algorithms, such as beamforming in multiantenna multiuser communications and waveform selection in cognitive radio networks. For these three research tracks we have reviewed the principal results pertaining to the issue of noncooperative waveform adaptation, and some open research problems have been discussed. We believe that, given the rapid pace at which wireless communications have been developing, waveform adaptation will play a key role in the future to enhance the performance of increasingly highly loaded wireless data networks.","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2009.933447","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/5230827/05230847.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"76","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2009.933447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5230827","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noncooperative waveform adaptation games in multiuser wireless communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5230847","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5230847/","displayDocTitle":"Noncooperative waveform adaptation games in multiuser wireless communications","volume":"26","issue":"5","publicationDate":"September 2009","accessionNumber":"10863245","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5230847/","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noncooperative waveform adaptation games in multiuser wireless communications","sourcePdf":"064-076-26msp05-buzzi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094783S","chronDate":"September  2009","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"5230827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5230827","articleId":"5230847","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5230848,"authors":[{"name":"Walid Saad","affiliation":["Computer and Communications Engineering, Lebanese University, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Walid","lastName":"Saad","id":"37392237900"},{"name":"Zhu Han","affiliation":["Electronic engineering, Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":"Han","id":"37278605300"},{"name":"Merouane Debbah","affiliation":["\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan, France"],"firstName":"Merouane","lastName":"Debbah","id":"37284195000"},{"name":"Are Hjorungnes","affiliation":["University of Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Are","lastName":"Hjorungnes","id":"37270835900"},{"name":"Tamer Basar","affiliation":["Robert Gordon''s College, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Tamer","lastName":"Basar","id":"37282738200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-5888"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0792"}],"articleNumber":"5230848","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":661,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":7610},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":" \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5230848","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Game theory","Communication networks","Collaboration","Performance loss","Costs","Nash equilibrium","Resource management","Radio control","Communication system control","Power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coalitional game theory","communication networks","wireless networks","canonical coalitional games","coalition formation games","coalitional graph games","comprehensive theory"]}],"abstract":"In this tutorial, we provided a comprehensive overview of coalitional game theory, and its usage in wireless and communication networks.

The result of application to a real-world engineering problem also suggests that the proposed optimization framework is capable of solving computationally expensive optimization problem effectively.","doi":"10.1109/CINC.2009.40","startPage":"174","endPage":"177","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Natural Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CINC.2009.40","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5230911","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Natural Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230910/5230911/05230996.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithms Using Gaussian Process Machine Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5230996/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Accelerating Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithms Using Gaussian Process Machine Learning","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5230996/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10867398","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2009","conferenceDate":"6-7 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 June 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithms Using Gaussian Process Machine Learning","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3645b174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065543S","chronDate":"6-7 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230910","isNumber":"5230911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230910","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5230911","articleId":"5230996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5231031,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In order to improve diversity of component classifiers, the idea of bit-plane decomposition is used and moving window classifier is used as a basic individual classifier. The quantized pattern representationspsila layers are used jointly to make a decision. And we mainly study several fused methods which include product, sum, majority vote, max, min and median rules.

The train running is simulated by a multi-particle simulator considering complicated line conditions and influence of train length. The GA chromosome consisting of a variable-length two dimensional real matrix represents the train control sequence.

Krause showed that the logarithm of approximation rank is a lower bound in the randomized case, and later Buhrman and de Wolf showed it could also be used for quantum communication complexity. As a lower bound technique, approximation rank has two main drawbacks: it is difficult to compute, and it is not known to lower bound the model of quantum communication complexity with entanglement. Linial and Shraibman recently introduced a quantity, called gamma\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">alpha</sup>\n, to quantum communication complexity, showing that it can be used to lower bound communication in the model with shared entanglement. Here alpha is a measure of approximation which is related to the allowable error probability of the protocol.

After taking into account the objective and subjective results of the noise image, this paper presents a new image denosing method. Firstly, this method decomposes the noisy image in order to get different sub-band image. Secondly, we remain the low-frequency wavelet coefficients unchanged, and after taking into account the relation of horizontal, vertical and diagonal high-frequency wavelet coefficients and comparing them with Donoho threshold, we make them enlarge and narrow relatively. Thirdly, we use soft-threshold denoising method to achieve image denoising. Finally, we get the denosing image by inverse wavelet transform. According to the result of experiment, this method compared to soft-threshold denosing method has a higher PSNR and visual effects.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Forum on Information Technology and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5231181/5231498/05231532.pdf","startPage":"111","endPage":"114","publicationTitle":"2009 International Forum on Information Technology and Applications","doi":"10.1109/IFITA.2009.47","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IFITA.2009.47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5231498","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5231532","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Image Denoising Method Using Wavelet Transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image denoising","Wavelet transforms","Noise reduction","Wavelet coefficients","Wavelet domain","PSNR","Low-frequency noise","Information technology","Laboratories","Noise level"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image denoising","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image denoising","wavelet transform","low-frequency wavelet coefficients","Donoho threshold","soft-threshold denoising method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wavelet transform","wavelet coefficients","threshold","image denosing","PSNR"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5231532/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A New Image Denoising Method Using Wavelet Transform","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5231532/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10865404","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2009","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Image Denoising Method Using Wavelet Transform","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"3600a111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051472S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5231181","isNumber":"5231498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5231181","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5231498","articleId":"5231532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5231536,"authors":[{"name":"Lihua Cao","affiliation":["School of Energy and Power Engineering, North China University of Electric Power, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lihua","lastName":"Cao","id":"37678423300"},{"name":"Yunlong Zhou","affiliation":["School of Energy and Power Engineering, Northeast Dianli University, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Yunlong","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37670563800"},{"name":"Wei Xu","affiliation":["School of Energy and Power Engineering, Northeast Dianli University, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Xu","id":"37897695300"},{"name":"Yong Li","affiliation":["School of Energy and Power Engineering, Northeast Dianli University, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Li","id":"37405709000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3645-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5231536","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5231536","abstract":"It is difficult to determine the normal value for fault diagnosis of steam turbine flow passage, because the flow passage fault or regenerative system fault may result in the decrease of the relative internal efficiency of steam turbine.

So it has more large potential than traditional codes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Forum on Information Technology and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5231181/5231498/05231638.pdf","startPage":"404","endPage":"406","publicationTitle":"2009 International Forum on Information Technology and Applications","doi":"10.1109/IFITA.2009.569","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IFITA.2009.569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5231498","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5231638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study on the Design of LAS Code in the LAS-CDMA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Autocorrelation","Interference elimination","Multiaccess communication","Spread spectrum communication","Information technology","Multiple access interference","Intersymbol interference","Paper technology","Laboratories","Control theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","codes","interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large area synchroniged code","large area synchroniged-CDMA","LA code","LS code","auto-correlation functions","cross-correlation functions","zero cross-correlation","zero interference window"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LA code","LS code","LAS code","auto-correlation function","cross-correlation function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5231638/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Study on the Design of LAS Code in the LAS-CDMA","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5231638/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10865441","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2009","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study on the Design of LAS Code in the LAS-CDMA","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"3600a404.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048305S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5231181","isNumber":"5231498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5231181","xplore-issue":"5231498","articleId":"5231638","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5231644,"authors":[{"name":"Deng Xiaolong","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Jiangsu College of Information Technology, Wuxi, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Deng","lastName":"Xiaolong","id":"37683303800"},{"name":"Zhou Pingfang","affiliation":["Institute of Astronautics & Aeronautics, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Pingfang","id":"37670400200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3645-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5231644","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Particle filters","Neurons","Neural networks","Computational intelligence","Computer networks","Mechanical engineering","Educational institutions","Information technology","Nonlinear dynamical systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kalman filters","learning (artificial intelligence)","nonlinear filters","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["training algorithm","diagonal recurrent neural network","particle filter","extended Kalman filter","network weights","resampling algorithm","nonlinear dynamical identification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["diagonal recurrent neural network","EKF","particle filter","nonlinear identification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5231644","abstract":"Based on particle filter, a new training algorithm combining the extended Kalman filter (EKF) for neural network is presented.

Therefore, in view of the features of vehicle types, this paper proposes a BP neural network car types classifier method based on fuzzy C-means clustering. First, on the basis of the pretreatment of the images of the vehicle, we abstract the features of car types from images and classify the massive data by fuzzy C- means clustering algorithm. Then, design the BP neural networks to train and test the classified data. Finally it is carried on compressive judgment by the computer. Experiments prove the validity of the classifier. It can recognize the highway vehicle types rapidly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5231735/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10865239","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5231735/","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2009","conferenceDate":"6-7 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Vehicle Types Recognition Based on Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicle Types Recognition Based on Neural Network","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3645a003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047722S","chronDate":"6-7 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230910","isNumber":"5231056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230910","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5231056","articleId":"5231735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5231747,"authors":[{"name":"P.T.V.

A number of nodes together constitute a network. As days proceed, the batteries used in the nodes lose their charge and subsequently get isolated from the network. Many energy harvesting schemes have been proposed to alleviate this problem. In this paper, a solar energy based energy harvesting scheme is proposed. This scheme works on the principle of photo-voltaic effect. A recharging circuitry is also designed, that recharges the batteries of the nodes when the charge drops below a threshold level. This leads to strengthening the lifetime of the nodes as well as the network. Compatibility and low power design are the two major salient features of the designed circuitry. The performance of the circuit is also tested with the MICAz hardware.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5231747/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5231747/","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10864143","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Solar Energy Harvesting for Wireless Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solar Energy Harvesting for Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Indore, India","sourcePdf":"3743a057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040281S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5231589","isNumber":"5231590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5231589","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5231590","articleId":"5231747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5231824,"authors":[{"name":"Pankaj Kumar Sharma","affiliation":["Department of E & C Engg., M.

The peak transmitted power can be substantially larger than that of a single carrier system. PTS (partial transmit sequence) can improve the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) statistics of an OFDM signal. In this paper, we have proposed a new partial transmit sequence (NPTS) approach which is a new algorithm for computing the best phase factors for PTS. This algorithm is compared with optimal binary phase sequence (OBPS). Simulation result shows that NPTS performs better than OBPS, but the reach complexity increases exponentially with number of sub blocks. We also investigate the effect of non-linear amplifiers on the performance of the new algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR Reduction for OFDM Scheme by New Partial Transmit Sequence Technique in Wireless Communication Systems","publicationTitle":"2009 First International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks","doi":"10.1109/CICSYN.2009.64","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 First International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5231589/5231590/05231824.pdf","startPage":"114","endPage":"118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICSYN.2009.64","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5231590","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5231824","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5231824/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"PAPR Reduction for OFDM Scheme by New Partial Transmit Sequence Technique in Wireless Communication Systems","conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5231824/","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10864151","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR Reduction for OFDM Scheme by New Partial Transmit Sequence Technique in Wireless Communication Systems","confLoc":"Indore, India","sourcePdf":"3743a114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049286S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5231589","isNumber":"5231590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5231589","xplore-issue":"5231590","articleId":"5231824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5231869,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Kattan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia","School of Computer Science, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Kattan","id":"37402116100"},{"name":"Rosni Abdullah","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia","School of Computer Science, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Rosni","lastName":"Abdullah","id":"37281593100"},{"name":"Rosalina Abdul Salam","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Rosalina Abdul","lastName":"Salam","id":"37321105400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3743-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5231869","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5231869","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedforward systems","Neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Hardware","Computer networks","Parallel processing","Distributed computing","Computational modeling","Computational intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Java","local area networks","matrix multiplication","multilayer perceptrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward multilayer neural network processing","matrix multiplication algorithms","heterogeneous distributed systems","local area network","Java technology"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CICSYN.2009.67","pdfPath":"/iel5/5231589/5231590/05231869.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 First International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 First International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks","startPage":"431","endPage":"435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5231590","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICSYN.2009.67","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing Feed-Forward Neural Network Processing Time Utilizing Matrix Multiplication Algorithms on Heterogeneous Distributed Systems","abstract":"This paper presents a work in progress that aims to reduce the overall training and processing time of feed-forward multi-layer neural networks.

It is observed that the phase information of the compressed data is preserved to the great extent. The quality of the reconstructed data is compared in terms of the important performance evaluation parameters like signal to noise ratio (SNR), standard deviation of the phase (PSD), mean phase error (MPE) and the compression ratio (CR). The amplitude-phase algorithm is compared with that of Block Adaptive Quantization (BAQ) algorithm. The evaluation procedure is carried out in two domains, raw data domain and image domain. Numerical experiments were carried out using ERS-2 satellite data supplied by European Space Agency (ESA) showing that amplitude-phase algorithm provides us with more compression ratio (CR) choices than BAQ and for certain CR, AP algorithm provides at least one choice whose performance is better than or equal to that of BAQ. These two algorithms neither affect spatial resolution nor generate geometric distortion. Both of them have only a little effect on radiometric resolution.","doi":"10.1109/CICSYN.2009.27","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICSYN.2009.27","startPage":"351","endPage":"356","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 First International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5231589/5231590/05231925.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 First International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5231590","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplitude Phase Algorithm for SAR Signal Processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Amplitude Phase Algorithm for SAR Signal Processing","conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5231925/","accessionNumber":"10864179","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5231925/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplitude Phase Algorithm for SAR Signal Processing","confLoc":"Indore, India","sourcePdf":"3743a351.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06826S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5231589","isNumber":"5231590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5231589","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5231590","articleId":"5231925","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5231964,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Wei","affiliation":["College of Electronics Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Wei","id":"38182837600"},{"name":"Li Wencheng","affiliation":["College of Electronics Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Wencheng","id":"37645233900"},{"name":"Chen Dan","affiliation":["College of Electronics Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Dan","id":"37397837500"},{"name":"Peng Neng","affiliation":["College of Electronics Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Neng","id":"37888133800"},{"name":"Li Kai","affiliation":["College of Electronics Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Kai","id":"37682075400"},{"name":"Lan Zhongwen","affiliation":["College of Microelectronics and Solid State Electronics, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Lan","lastName":"Zhongwen","id":"37903362000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3614-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5231964","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":330},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Power dividers","Genetic algorithms","Design optimization","Power transmission lines","Transformers","Resistors","Genetic mutations","Convergence","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","power dividers","transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-frequency unequal power divider","genetic algorithm","design optimization","two-section transmission line transformers","elitist strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["unequal power divider","Wilkison power divider","genetic algorithm","design optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5231964","abstract":"A dual-frequency unequal power divider design optimization with genetic algorithm is proposed.

In this paper, a Quasi-birth-and-death (QBD) process model is developed for the purpose of evaluating the CAC schemes of the cellular systems, where exist several types of traffics with different arrival rates. The CAC controller seeks to optimize the throughput and minimize the blocking probability. We obtain the theoretical expressions of several parameters that indicate the performance of the system, such as connection blocking probability, channel utilization, and normalized throughput, by analyzing the complete sharing CAC scheme. Simulations are implemented and the results show that the simulated outcomes coincide with the theoretical results got from the expressions. This verifies that the modeling is proper to evaluate the performance of CAC scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Evaluation Model for Call Admission Control Scheme in CDMA System","publicationTitle":"2009 International Forum on Information Technology and Applications","doi":"10.1109/IFITA.2009.311","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Forum on Information Technology and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5231181/5232043/05232087.pdf","startPage":"170","endPage":"173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IFITA.2009.311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5232043","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5232087","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5232087/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Evaluation Model for Call Admission Control Scheme in CDMA System","conferenceDate":"15-17 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5232087/","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10867704","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Evaluation Model for Call Admission Control Scheme in CDMA System","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"3600c170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06224S","chronDate":"15-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5231181","isNumber":"5232043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5231181","xplore-issue":"5232043","articleId":"5232087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5232093,"authors":[{"name":"Hu Chaoju","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Hu","lastName":"Chaoju","id":"37546278400"},{"name":"Wang Xuning","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Xuning","id":"37887751100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3600-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5232093","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":351},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Protocols","Digital signatures","Information security","Performance analysis","Robustness","Protection","Data mining","Image generation","Resists"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["copy protection","digital signatures","feature extraction","image coding","protocols","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zero watermark protocol","time-stamp","digital signature","digital watermark technique","copyright protection","DHWM protocol","digital image","digital certificate","feature extraction","security analysis","performance analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DHWM","digital signature","time-stamp","zero watermark"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5232093","abstract":"Zero watermark is a new research direction of the digital watermark technique.

It employs spreading in the transmitter and joint detection (SP-JD) in the receiver.

This paper presents the use of a hybrid hidden Markov model (HMM) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) for automatic speech recognition. The proposed hybrid system for ASR is to take advantage from the properties of both HMM and ANN, improving flexibility and recognition performance. The hybrid ANN/HMM assumes that the output of an ANN is sent to the HMM for ASR. The architecture relies on a probabilistic interpretation of the ANN outputs. Each output unit of the ANN is trained to perform a non-parametric estimate of the posterior probability of a continuous density HMM state given the acoustic observations. After a brief review of HMM and ANN, the paper reports the theoretical aspects and the performance of the proposed hybrid model. Experimental results are listed to demonstrate the potential of this hybrid model.","doi":"10.1109/PACCS.2009.138","pdfPath":"/iel5/5231958/5231959/05232417.pdf","startPage":"682","endPage":"685","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Pacific-Asia Conference on Circuits, Communications and Systems","publicationTitle":"2009 Pacific-Asia Conference on Circuits, Communications and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACCS.2009.138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5231959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Hidden Markov Model and Artificial Neural Network for Automatic Speech Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5232417/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Hidden Markov Model and Artificial Neural Network for Automatic Speech Recognition","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10864461","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5232417/","conferenceDate":"16-17 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Hidden Markov Model and Artificial Neural Network for Automatic Speech Recognition","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"3614a682.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05994S","chronDate":"16-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5231958","isNumber":"5231959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5231958","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5231959","articleId":"5232417","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5232418,"authors":[{"name":"Sihua Chen","affiliation":["School of Information Management, JiangXi University of Finance And Economics, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Sihua","lastName":"Chen","id":"37896919800"},{"name":"Changqi Tao","affiliation":["School of Information Management, JiangXi University of Finance And Economics, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Changqi","lastName":"Tao","id":"37873507500"},{"name":"Wei He","affiliation":["School of business and administration, JiangXi University of Finance And Economics, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"He","id":"37399339000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3614-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5232418","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5232418","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Stock markets","Backpropagation algorithms","Economic forecasting","Artificial neural networks","Neurons","Finance","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Mean square error methods","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","stock markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network","China stock market","nonlinear dynamic system","nonlinear problems","economic forecasting","stock price","BP algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural network","Prediction","Deviation rate","Chain rule"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PACCS.2009.140","pdfPath":"/iel5/5231958/5231959/05232418.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Pacific-Asia Conference on Circuits, Communications and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Pacific-Asia Conference on Circuits, Communications and Systems","startPage":"686","endPage":"689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5231959","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACCS.2009.140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Algorithm of Neural Network and Prediction in China Stock Market","abstract":"Artificial neural network is a nonlinear dynamic system, which can attain the reflection of nonlinear relations among variables within any precision, possessing the ability of solving nonlinear problems, therefore also meeting requirements of economic forecasting.

The discrete-time neural networks have a finite number of modes, and the modes may jump from one to another according to a Markov chain. We aim at designing a state estimator to estimate the neuron state through available output measurements. By using Laypunov-Krasovskii functional and linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, a sufficient condition is established to solve the state estimation problem. The desired estimator matrix gain is characterized in terms of the solution to these LMIs.

The highest investment benefit, which is discounted back to present, is taken as objective function. The restriction of total investment is considered in the form of punishment functions. On the basis of which, an augmented index is established. Every possible installing location of the automatic reactive compensation equipments is regarded as a gene. The value of each gene is the installing time of the corresponding compensation equipment while zero means no compensation equipment needing to install. A genetic algorithm is adopted to determine the optimal dynamic planning results of the compensation equipments on the low voltage side of distribution transformers. The load varying is also considered in the proposed method. Three cases are detailed, such as without limiting total investment, limiting total investment and limiting the investment of every phase showing that the proposed method is feasible.","doi":"10.1109/PACCS.2009.197","startPage":"752","endPage":"754","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Pacific-Asia Conference on Circuits, Communications and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5231958/5231959/05232434.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Pacific-Asia Conference on Circuits, Communications and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACCS.2009.197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5231959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Reactive Power Planning of Oil Field Distribution Networks Based on Genetic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reactive power","Petroleum","Genetic algorithms","Transformers","Investments","Power system planning","Circuits","Genetic engineering","Power engineering and energy","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power distribution planning","reactive power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic reactive power planning","oil field distribution networks","genetic algorithm","automatic reactive compensation equipments","dynamic planning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["oil field","dynamic planning","genetic algorithm","distribution network","reactive power compensation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5232434/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Reactive Power Planning of Oil Field Distribution Networks Based on Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5232434/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2009","conferenceDate":"16-17 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10867071","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Reactive Power Planning of Oil Field Distribution Networks Based on Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"3614a752.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08736S","chronDate":"16-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5231958","isNumber":"5231959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5231958","xplore-issue":"5231959","articleId":"5232434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5232443,"authors":[{"name":"Guifen Zhao","affiliation":["department of Library, Hebei University of Engineering, Handan, China"],"firstName":"Guifen","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37896143100"},{"name":"Jingbo Liu","affiliation":["College of the Science, Hebei University of Engineering, Handan, China"],"firstName":"Jingbo","lastName":"Liu","id":"37898602800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3614-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5232443","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":221},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5232443","abstract":"The evaluation of information system is a complex system.

The results show that finite element method is not only able to identify the failure locations and determine the stress and strain to cause failures but also perform design for reliability.","doi":"10.1109/IPFA.2009.5232687","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Symposium on the Physical and Failure Analysis of Integrated Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Symposium on the Physical and Failure Analysis of Integrated Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/5210717/5232547/05232687.pdf","startPage":"108","endPage":"116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPFA.2009.5232687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5232547","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Failure analyses of 3D Sip (system-in-package) and WLP (wafer-level package) by finite element methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5232687","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5232687/","displayDocTitle":"Failure analyses of 3D Sip (system-in-package) and WLP (wafer-level package) by finite element methods","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10866801","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5232687/","conferenceDate":"6-10 July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Failure analyses of 3D Sip (system-in-package) and WLP (wafer-level package) by finite element methods","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"4A_0_2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095131S","chronDate":"6-10 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5210717","isNumber":"5232547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5210717","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5232547","articleId":"5232687","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5232700,"authors":[{"name":"Hung Sung Lin","affiliation":["United Microelectronics Corporation Limited, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hung Sung","lastName":"Lin","id":"37834484000"},{"name":"Vincent Huang","affiliation":["United Microelectronics Corporation Limited, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Huang","id":"37264978200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3911-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3912-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-1542"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1550"}],"articleNumber":"5232700","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":325},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","CMOS technology","Rapid thermal processing","Counting circuits","Doping","Dielectric devices","Dielectric measurements","Threshold voltage","Etching","Thermal degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS digital integrated circuits","dielectric materials","diffusion","etching","SRAM chips","thermal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["core CMOS SRAM device","embedded flash technology","lateral diffusion","thermal budget","nanoprobe technique","MOS characteristics","PMOS","threshold voltage","selective etching technique","thermal treatment","thermal oxidation layer","fabrication process flow","polysilicon gate oxide interface","on-state current degradation","voltage 0.9 V"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents insights into the mechanisms of counter doping and gate depletion due to the lateral diffusion of dopants in embedded flash technology. Core SRAM device behavior is modified by the thermal budget needed to process the specific flash dielectrics. Using a nanoprobe technique, the MOS characteristics of failed and good bits used as a reference in actual SRAM cells were measured directly. In the worst cases, it was confirmed that the on-state current of a PMOS was about three orders of magnitude smaller than that of normal bits, and the threshold voltage was of about 0.9 V higher. A selective etching technique using a KOH solution showed these degradations were caused by local gate depletion. The fabrication process flow shows that the thermal treatment used to form the rapid thermal oxidation layer, causing additional thermal budget, can lead to lateral As-dopant diffusion into a B-doped gate. This diffusion can cause work-function shift, as well as the formation of a depletion capacitor at the polysilicon gate oxide interface, while the MOS is biased. Adjusting the N+ implant boundary for the second poly layer to increase the margin has been found to be quite effective in improving the on-state current degradation and increasing yield.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of thermal budget impact on core CMOS SRAM device in an embedded FLASH technology","doi":"10.1109/IPFA.2009.5232700","startPage":"54","endPage":"58","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPFA.2009.5232700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5232547","publicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Symposium on the Physical and Failure Analysis of Integrated Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 16th IEEE International Symposium on the Physical and Failure Analysis of Integrated Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/5210717/5232547/05232700.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5232700","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5232700/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of thermal budget impact on core CMOS SRAM device in an embedded FLASH technology","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5232700/","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10866735","conferenceDate":"6-10 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of thermal budget impact on core CMOS SRAM device in an embedded FLASH technology","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"2B_4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0606S","chronDate":"6-10 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5210717","isNumber":"5232547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5210717","xplore-issue":"5232547","articleId":"5232700","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5232707,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.H.

The goal of node selection is to optimize the tradeoff between the energy consumption of wireless camera sensor networks and the quality of target localization. We propose a cooperative target localization algorithm, which is implemented by two phases: 1) target detecting phase and 2) target locating phase. For the target detecting phase, we develop a probing environment and adaptive sleeping (PEAS)-based density control algorithm to select the proper subset of deployed camera sensors for maintaining the desired density of nodes in the detecting mode. For the locating phase, we map the node-selection problem into an optimization problem and then propose an optimal node-selection algorithm to select a subset of camera sensors for estimating the location of a target while minimizing the energy cost. We conduct extensive experiments and simulations to validate and evaluate our proposed schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2031454","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5571765/05232832.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2031454","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"3562","endPage":"3576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Node Selection for Target Localization in Wireless Camera Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5232832","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Node Selection for Target Localization in Wireless Camera Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5232832/","volume":"59","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5232832/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11523630","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Node Selection for Target Localization in Wireless Camera Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhang-2031454-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089474S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5571765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"5571765","articleId":"5232832","onlineDate":"04 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5232834,"authors":[{"name":"Tricia J.

The data were obtained in a vehicular urban environment, with a fixed transmitter array and a mobile receiver array. The measured channel response matrices were decomposed to isolate the coupling from the transmitter eigenbasis to the received eigenbasis, as in the Weichselberger model. These complex coupling elements have been characterized and seen to comprise directional components that may be Ricean or Rayleigh fading. The Rayleigh fading directional components can be well modeled using the von Mises probability density function, which is parameterized for the time-varying model using the measured data. The model has been validated by comparing the mutual information and eigenstructure autocorrelation characteristics of its output with those of the measured data. The statistical nature of the model means that different realizations can be generated, each representative of the originating data.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Observation-Based Time-Varying MIMO Channel Model","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2031456","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5383378/05232834.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2031456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383378","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5232834","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5232834/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Observation-Based Time-Varying MIMO Channel Model","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5232834/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11070331","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Observation-Based Time-Varying MIMO Channel Model","sourcePdf":"tvt-willink-2031456.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08532S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5383378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5383378","articleId":"5232834","onlineDate":"04 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5232835,"authors":[{"name":"Pablo A.

More recently, lithium batteries, in the form of lithium-ion, lithium-polymer, or lithium iron phosphate, have profoundly been explored. Despite critical research initiatives, lithium-based batteries have not yet been able to meet the steep energy demands, long lifetime, and low cost, which are unique to vehicular-propulsion applications. One of the most practical techniques of improving overall performance is to use suitable power electronics intensive cell-voltage equalizers in conjunction with onboard energy-storage devices. There have been some interesting developments in this area during the last few years, but cost constraints and high current specifications have prevented the complete deployment of this versatile technology. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a novel configuration for a cell-voltage equalizer, with the potential of fulfilling the expectations of low cost, high current capability, and high efficiency. A comprehensive comparison between the theoretical novel equalizer, a typical equalizer, and the experimental prototype of the novel equalizer will be presented, which will help analyze performance, complexity, and cost.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2031553","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5277109/05232835.pdf","startPage":"3938","endPage":"3946","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2031553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feasibility Analysis of a Novel Cell Equalizer Topology for Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle Energy-Storage Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Feasibility Analysis of a Novel Cell Equalizer Topology for Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle Energy-Storage Systems","volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5232835/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10903084","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5232835/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feasibility Analysis of a Novel Cell Equalizer Topology for Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle Energy-Storage Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-williamson-2031553.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090999S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5277109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"5277109","articleId":"5232835","onlineDate":"04 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5232838,"authors":[{"name":"Anirban Das","affiliation":["Bangalore Design Center, Nvidia Corporation, Bangalore, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/5410067/5232838/5232838-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anirban Das received the B.E. degree in electronics and telecommunication engineering from Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, India, and the M.S. degree in electronics and electrical communication engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India.

For this purpose, an improved magnetic equivalent circuit for calculation of the teeth and yoke flux densities in the LPMSMs is presented. The magnetic saturation of iron core is considered by nonlinear elements and an iterative procedure is used to update these elements. The armature reaction is also taken into account in the modeling by flux sources located on the teeth of motors. These sources are time dependent and can model every winding configuration. The relative motion between the motor primary and secondary is considered by wisely designing air gap elements simplifying the permeance network construction and preventing permeance matrix distortion during primary motion. Flux densities in different load conditions are calculated by means of the proposed model. The effects of saturation and armature reaction on the flux density distribution are shown in detail. Using these flux densities, iron losses in the motor are examined and its variations versus motor parameters are then studied. All results obtained by proposed model are verified by finite-element method based on an extensive analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 September 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5232839/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"46","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5232839/","accessionNumber":"11024645","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Magnetic Equivalent Circuit Model for Iron-Core Linear Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Magnetic Equivalent Circuit Model for Iron-Core Linear Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motors","sourcePdf":"tmag-ahassanpourisfahani-2030674.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159214S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"5357491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"114","xplore-issue":"5357491","articleId":"5232839","onlineDate":"04 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5232859,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Zhao","affiliation":["Photonic Research Centre, Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"p":["Jian Zhao (S'08) was born in Tianjin, China, in 1981.

As no electrolytic capacitor is used, this driver possesses the unique advantage of long lifetime to match with that of LEDs. A method of injecting the third and fifth harmonics into the input current to reduce the peak-to-average ratio of the output current is also proposed. While ensuring that the input power factor is higher than 0.9 to meet regulation standards such as ENERGY STAR, the proposed method allows the peak-to-average ratio of the output current to be reduced to 1.34 theoretically, which is beneficial for the safe operation of the LEDs. As an example, a flyback-based electrolytic capacitor-less LED driver is proposed, and its operation is analyzed. In order to inject the third and fifth harmonics into the input current, the function of the duty cycle in a half-line cycle is derived. It is then simplified to a fitting function, which can be easily implemented with the input voltage sensing. A 25 V, 0.35 A output prototype is built and tested in the laboratory, and the experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the electrolytic capacitor-less LED driver and its control method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5232882/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"25","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 March 2010","accessionNumber":"11205772","htmlLink":"/document/5232882/","displayDocTitle":"A Method of Reducing the Peak-to-Average Ratio of LED Current for Electrolytic Capacitor-Less AC\u2013DC Drivers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Method of Reducing the Peak-to-Average Ratio of LED Current for Electrolytic Capacitor-Less AC\u2013DC Drivers","sourcePdf":"tpel-author-2031319.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069905S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5440038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"272","xplore-issue":"5440038","articleId":"5232882","onlineDate":"04 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":5232887,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Hartmann","affiliation":["Power Electronic Systems Laboratory, ETH Zurich, ETH Zentrum-ETL, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5338051/5232887/5232887-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michael Hartmann (S\u201908) received the B.S. degree (with honors) and the M.Sc. degree (with honors) in electrical engineering from the University of Technology VIENNA, VIENNA, Austria, in 2005 and 2006, respectively.

If these current controllers are implemented purely digitally, which is well established today for 20-200 kHz converter systems, then very high numerical data processing demands result. In this paper, two different types of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are evaluated for realizing high-speed converter current control. For the implementation of such controllers, not only the FPGA has to be considered but rather the entire signal chain. Two alternative A/D interfaces (including high-speed low-voltage differential signaling data transmission) that are able to handle data sampling rates up to 25 MSa/s are verified. Subsequently, a digital current controller is designed and it is shown how hardware multiplier blocks of modern FPGAs can be used advantageously. Furthermore, the FPGA implementation of high-resolution pulsewidth modulation providing symmetrical pulse patterns for high switching frequencies is described. Measurements taken from a 10 kW VIENNA rectifier laboratory prototype finally demonstrate the high performance of the proposed control concept and show that a low mains current total harmonic distortion of 1.4% can be achieved for such ultrahigh switching frequency converters.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power

Traditional two-step methods solve this problem through employing super-resolution (SR). However, these methods usually have limited performance because the target of SR is not absolutely consistent with that of face recognition. Moreover, time-consuming sophisticated SR algorithms are not suitable for real-time applications. To avoid these limitations, we propose a novel approach for LR face recognition without any SR preprocessing. Our method based on coupled mappings (CMs), projects the face images with different resolutions into a unified feature space which favors the task of classification. These CMs are learned through optimizing the objective function to minimize the difference between the correspondences (i.e., low-resolution image and its high-resolution counterpart). Inspired by locality preserving methods for dimensionality reduction, we introduce a penalty weighting matrix into our objective function. Our method significantly improves the recognition performance. Finally, we conduct experiments on publicly available databases to verify the efficacy of our algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/5263912/05232898.pdf","startPage":"20","endPage":"23","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2009.2031705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2009.2031705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5263912","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5232898","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Resolution Face Recognition via Coupled Locality Preserving Mappings","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Strontium","Collision mitigation","Image resolution","Computers","Image reconstruction","Image databases","Degradation","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image classification","image resolution","matrix algebra","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-resolution face recognition","coupled locality preserving mapping","super-resolution","image classification","objective function minimization","penalty weighting matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coupled locality preserving mappings","face recognition","low-resolution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5232898/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Low-Resolution Face Recognition via Coupled Locality Preserving Mappings","volume":"17","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5232898/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"10927029","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Resolution Face Recognition via Coupled Locality Preserving Mappings","sourcePdf":"17lsp01-bli-2031705.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071822S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"5263912","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"5263912","articleId":"5232898","onlineDate":"04 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5233200,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Pang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, California State University, Sacramento, Sacramento, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Pang","id":"37893609900"},{"name":"Shitalben Chauhan","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Folsom, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shitalben","lastName":"Chauhan","id":"37902027600"},{"name":"Jay Maheshkumar Bhlodia","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Folsom, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jay Maheshkumar","lastName":"Bhlodia","id":"37892153300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3555-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3545-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5233200","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":465},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5233200","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Field programmable gate arrays","SDRAM","Digital signal processors","Costs","Digital signal processing chips","Speech codecs","Streaming media","Low pass filters","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","digital signal processing chips","discrete wavelet transforms","field programmable gate arrays","speech coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech compression FPGA","discrete wavelet transform","digital signal processor","field programmable gate array","configurable datapath","Daubechies lifting scheme DWT","audio CODEC chip","SDRAM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","speech compression","discrete wavelet transform","Daubechies lifting scheme","audio CODEC","SDRAM"]}],"abstract":"Compared with the traditional digital signal processor, the field programmable gate array (FPGA) has advantages of configurable datapath, low cost, reprogrammability, and high performance.

A situation with employees working on tasks that they are not well-suited for can lead to a significant loss of time and resources in addition to a sub-par product or service. This paper present a project human resource allocation method based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) in a project organization. We developed the mathematical model of project human resource optimization allocation using the competency model theory, and then in order to obtain a solution efficiently, we proposed a particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) approach based on the decision-making model for solving the allocation optimization problem of project human resource. According to the proposed method, we applied the PSO to seek feasible solution for the problem. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was validated by its application to an illustrative example dealing with project human resource allocation problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5233319/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10867349","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5233319/","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2009","conferenceDate":"11-12 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The Allocation Optimization of Project Human Resource Based on Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Allocation Optimization of Project Human Resource Based on Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","confLoc":"Zhangjiajie, China","sourcePdf":"3729a169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049026S","chronDate":"11-12 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5233201","isNumber":"5233202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5233201","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5233202","articleId":"5233319","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5233346,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Li","affiliation":["Mathematical Modeling Innovative Practice Base, Zhuhai College Jinan University, Zhuhai, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Li","id":"37897939500"},{"name":"Yuanbiao Zhang","affiliation":["Mathematical Modeling Innovative Practice Base, Zhuhai College Jinan University, Zhuhai, China"],"firstName":"Yuanbiao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405800600"},{"name":"Weigang Jiang","affiliation":["Mathematical Modeling Innovative Practice Base, Zhuhai College Jinan University, Zhuhai, China"],"firstName":"Weigang","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37399917100"},{"name":"Jianwen Xie","affiliation":["Mathematical Modeling Innovative Practice Base, Zhuhai College Jinan University, Zhuhai, China"],"firstName":"Jianwen","lastName":"Xie","id":"37405095100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3729-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5233346","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5233346","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Scheduling algorithm","Genetic algorithms","Iterative algorithms","Project management","Convergence","NP-hard problem","Heuristic algorithms","Conference management","Innovation management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","genetic algorithms","particle swarm optimisation","project management","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization algorithm","resource constrained project scheduling problem","genetic algorithm","convergence rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["resource constrained project scheduling problem","particle swarm algorithm with crossover","genetic algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SSME.2009.131","pdfPath":"/iel5/5233201/5233202/05233346.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IITA International Conference on Services Science, Management and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IITA International Conference on Services Science, Management and Engineering","startPage":"69","endPage":"72","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5233202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSME.2009.131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm with Crossover for Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem","abstract":"Resource and project optimization scheduling has become the key of the success of researching project in the enterprises.

The circumstances around global warming and the availability of future oil supplies only increase the focus on electric motors as key elements in the efficient utilization of energy resources. PMs offer an important tool in the quest for cost-effective ways to further increase motor efficiencies. The characteristics of PM motors are sufficiently distinct from that of induction motors that users need to understand their operation to ensure successful applications. The nonsalient PM rotor construction provides high efficiency and high-torque density, whereas the salient pole construction offers some distinct advantages, especially with regard to system issues. Full flexibility to use other than 50 or 60 Hz base frequencies to further optimize performance obviously requires application with an inverter. Once the decision is made to use an inverter, the variable-frequency degree of freedom, with regard to pole selection, works in favor of the PM motor design. The improving performance to cost relationship of PM materials is getting to the point where the increased power density of the PM motor can be large enough to offset the cost of the magnets. While the authors would not suggest that PM motors are going to replace the widespread usage of induction motors, the PM motors provide an interesting alternative, especially in the case where an inverter is to be used in the application. It is for those inverter-fed applications that the first usage is expected in the pulp and paper industry.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5233375/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"November-December  2009","volume":"15","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10919100","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2009","publicationDate":"November-December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5233375/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Induction versus permanent magnet motors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Induction versus permanent magnet motors","sourcePdf":"28-35-15mias06-melfi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055626S","chronDate":"November-December  2009","xplore-pub-id":"2943","isNumber":"5233366","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2943","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"5233366","articleId":"5233375","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5233378,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Lu","affiliation":["Eaton Corporation Innovation Center, Wisconsin"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Lu","id":"37288124300"},{"name":"David B.

In cascode topology the supply voltage is limited by the breakdown voltage of the common-gate transistor. So a self biased technique is used at the common-gate to allow RF swing at the gate to boost the biasing voltage above VDD. This enables us to design the PA such that the cascode transistor has the same maximum drain-gate voltage. Consequently, we can have a larger signal swing at the output before encountering the breakdown. By using this combination, the gate of the NMOS is boosted above VDD and the power consumption is reduced.

the decisions that grid operators are asked to make on a daily basis. While wind forecasting was something that was considered a luxury only a few years ago, it is critical to today's operation. There are other solutions that the industry is developing to incorporate high levels of wind, such as demand-side management, developing flexible resources to accommodate ramping and cycling needs, and developing larger BAs and market tools to allow the development of ancillary services. But wind forecasting will always be a crucial part of the solution and the primary tool that grid operators will rely on to implement policies and procedures to reliably and economically operate the system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5233737/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November-December  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5233737/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"November-December 2009","accessionNumber":"10943014","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Change in the air","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Change in the air","sourcePdf":"07mpe06-grant.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070443S","chronDate":"November-December  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8014","isNumber":"5233728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8014","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5233728","articleId":"5233737","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5233756,"authors":[{"name":"Tatsuo Nozokido","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering of Research, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan"],"firstName":"Tatsuo","lastName":"Nozokido","id":"38561601900"},{"name":"Masamitsu Noto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering of Research, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan"],"firstName":"Masamitsu","lastName":"Noto","id":"37901610400"},{"name":"Tadakuni Murai","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering of Research, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan"],"firstName":"Tadakuni","lastName":"Murai","id":"37062234000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"5233756","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":247},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5233756","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microscopy","Millimeter wave technology","Probes","Optical imaging","Frequency","Spatial resolution","Millimeter wave measurements","Apertures","Switches","Object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microscopy","millimetre wave imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["passive millimeter-wave microscopy","millimeter-wave imaging","scanning near-field microscopy","diffraction limit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Millimeter-wave","passive imaging","scanning near-field microscopy"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2009.2029741","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/5257420/05233756.pdf","startPage":"638","endPage":"640","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2009.2029741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5257420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Passive Millimeter-Wave Microscopy","abstract":"A new type of millimeter-wave imaging technique, passive millimeter-wave microscopy is proposed and demonstrated.

The two-stage Doherty amplifiers achieve high gain and high efficiency. Also, the linearity of the WDDA is improved by the post-distortion using gate bias optimization of the Doherty amplifiers. For verification, the proposed WDDA is implemented using GaN HEMTs and tested with a one-carrier WCDMA signal at 2.14 GHz. From the measured results at an average output power of 36 dBm (10 dB back-off power), the WDDA shows an adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) of - 45 dBc at plusmn 5 MHz offset with a total gain over 24 dB and a total power-added efficiency over 15% over a 160 MHz bandwidth.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadband amplifiers","Distributed amplifiers","Multiaccess

In such systems, the transmitter typically does not have complete information on the channel states, but can learn by probing individual channels at the expense of certain resources, e.g., energy and time. The main goal is to derive optimal strategies for determining which channels to probe, in what sequence, and which channel to use for transmission. We consider two problems within this context and show that they are equivalent to different data maximization and throughput maximization problems. For both problems, we derive key structural properties of the corresponding optimal strategy. In particular, we show that it has a threshold structure and can be described by an index policy. We further show that the optimal strategy for the first problem can only take one of three structural forms. Using these results, we first present a dynamic program that computes the optimal strategy within a finite number of steps, even when the state space is uncountably infinite. We then present and examine a more efficient, but suboptimal, two-step look-ahead strategy for each problem. These strategies are shown to be optimal for a number of cases of practical interest. We examine their performance via numerical studies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Channel Probing and Transmission Scheduling for Opportunistic Spectrum Access","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2009.2014460","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/5342336/05233772.pdf","startPage":"1805","endPage":"1818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2009.2014460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5342336","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5233772","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5233772/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Channel Probing and Transmission Scheduling for Opportunistic Spectrum Access","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5233772/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11020209","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Channel Probing and Transmission Scheduling for Opportunistic Spectrum Access","sourcePdf":"tnet-chang-2014460.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110958S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"5342336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"5342336","articleId":"5233772","onlineDate":"09 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5233779,"authors":[{"name":"Shafayat Abrar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK","COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Shafayat","lastName":"Abrar","id":"37284164600"},{"name":"Asoke K.

This causes degradation in the performance of a wideband or ultra-wideband (UWB) implanted device. Moreover, the electrical properties of tissue change from organ to organ, and possibly from time to time. In this paper, it is shown that loading of antennas with suitable insulators can deliver broadband matching across a range of dissipative medium properties. An impedance-matched UWB antenna designed to operate inside a lossy medium, which has varying electromagnetic properties within the range expected in biological tissues, is presented. The operating bandwidth of the proposed design is 3.5-4.5 GHz, which is an interference-free subset of the unlicensed UWB band in the US. It is demonstrated that once the dielectric loading is applied, the conventional procedure for antenna design in free space can be followed. The proposed implantable small capsule-shaped slot antenna has been characterized using numerical simulations. Details of a proof-of-concept experiment are presented.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5280560/05233780.pdf","startPage":"2480","endPage":"2487","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2009.2029664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2009.2029664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5280560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dielectric Loaded Impedance Matching for Wideband Implanted Antennas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5233780/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Dielectric Loaded Impedance Matching for Wideband Implanted Antennas","htmlLink":"/document/5233780/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10917916","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dielectric Loaded Impedance Matching for Wideband Implanted Antennas","sourcePdf":"57tmtt10-tdissanayake-part2-2029664.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074239S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5280560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"5280560","articleId":"5233780","onlineDate":"09 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5233792,"authors":[{"name":"Stefania Sardellitti","affiliation":["INFOCOM Department, University of Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5379139/5233792/5233792-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefania Sardellitti was born in Pontecorvo, Italy, in 1970.

However, distributed algorithms are typically iterative and they suffer from convergence time and energy consumption. In this paper, we show that introducing appropriate asymmetric interaction mechanisms, with time-varying weights on each edge, it is possible to provide a substantial increase of convergence rate with respect to the symmetric time-invariant case. The basic idea underlying our approach comes from modeling the average consensus algorithm as an advection-diffusion process governing the homogenization of fluid mixtures. Exploiting such a conceptual link, we show how introducing interaction mechanisms among nearby nodes, mimicking suitable advection processes, yields a substantial increase of convergence rate. Moreover, we show that the homogenization enhancement induced by the advection term produces a qualitatively different scaling law of the convergence rate versus the network size with respect to the symmetric case.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5379139/05233792.pdf","startPage":"826","endPage":"842","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2032030","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2032030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379139","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5233792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Distributed Average Consensus Algorithms Based on Advection-Diffusion Processes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Iterative algorithms","Sensor fusion","Distributed algorithms","Clustering algorithms","Motion control","Scheduling algorithm","Topology","Energy consumption","Diffusion processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directed graphs","partial differential equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast distributed average consensus algorithms","advection-diffusion processes","convergence rate","symmetric time-invariant case","homogenization enhancement","distributed algorithms","sensor networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Advection diffusion processes","consensus algorithms","convergence","distributed algorithms","sensor networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5233792/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fast Distributed Average Consensus Algorithms Based on Advection-Diffusion Processes","volume":"58","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5233792/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11054888","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Distributed Average Consensus Algorithms Based on Advection-Diffusion Processes","sourcePdf":"58tsp02-ssardellitti-2032030.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123064S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5379139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5379139","articleId":"5233792","onlineDate":"09 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5233794,"authors":[{"name":"Lyubomir L.

To improve further tolerance to optical fiber polarization-mode dispersion, we iterate extrinsic soft information between the MAP detector and soft-iterative decoder, in a turbo equalization fashion.

The majority of faults in a software system, particularly high-assurance systems, usually lie in a very small percentage of the software modules. This imbalance between the number of fault-prone (fp) and non-fp (nfp) modules can have a severely negative impact on a data-mining technique's ability to differentiate between the two. This paper addresses the class-imbalance problem as it pertains to the domain of software-quality prediction. We present a comprehensive empirical study examining two different methodologies, data sampling and boosting, for improving the performance of decision-tree models designed to identify fp software modules. This paper applies five data-sampling techniques and boosting to 15 software-quality data sets of different sizes and levels of imbalance. Nearly 50 000 models were built for the experiments contained in this paper. Our results show that while data-sampling techniques are very effective in improving the performance of such models, boosting almost always outperforms even the best data-sampling techniques. This significant result, which, to our knowledge, has not been previously reported, has important consequences for practitioners developing software-quality classification models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5233804/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2009","volume":"39","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"10928490","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5233804/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Improving Software-Quality Predictions With Data Sampling and Boosting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Software-Quality Predictions With Data Sampling and Boosting","sourcePdf":"tsmca-khoshgoftaar-2027131.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111045S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"5281203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"5281203","articleId":"5233804","onlineDate":"09 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5233810,"authors":[{"name":"Paul A.

These class of codes are considered for error correction over real fields. All the existing algebraic decoding algorithms are capable of decoding only a subclass of these codes [which can be characterized into the Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) form], and fails to decode the remaining even though they are MDS. In this paper, we propose a new generic algorithm along the lines of coding theoretic and subspace methods to decode the entire class of MDS DCT and DST codes. The proposed subspace approaches are similar to popular ESPRIT and MUSIC algorithms. The proposed algorithms also perform significantly better than the existing algorithms on the BCH-like subclass. A perturbation analysis is also presented to study the effect of various parameters on the error localization due to the quantization noise. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the capability of proposed algorithms to decode the entire class and to perform significantly better on the BCH-like subclass than the existing algorithm under the influence of quantization noise.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2031727","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5379139/05233818.pdf","startPage":"695","endPage":"708","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2031727","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Coding-Theoretic and Subspace-Based Decoding Algorithms for a Wider Class of DCT and DST Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5233818","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Improved Coding-Theoretic and Subspace-Based Decoding Algorithms for a Wider Class of DCT and DST Codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5233818/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11054916","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5233818/","volume":"58","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Coding-Theoretic and Subspace-Based Decoding Algorithms for a Wider Class of DCT and DST Codes","sourcePdf":"58tsp02-akumar-2031727.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094219S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5379139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5379139","articleId":"5233818","onlineDate":"09 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5233819,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan M.

The goal of the base stations is to jointly adjust the beamforming vectors to minimize the transmission powers while ensuring the signal-to-interference-noise ratio requirement of each user within the system. At the same time, it may be necessary to keep the interference generated on other coexisting systems under a certain tolerable level. In addition, one may want to include general individual shaping constraints on the beamforming vectors. This beamforming problem is a separable homogeneous quadratically constrained quadratic program, and it is difficult to solve in general. In this paper, we give conditions under which strong duality holds and propose efficient algorithms for the optimal beamforming problem. First, we study rank-constrained solutions of general separable semidefinite programs (SDPs) and propose rank reduction procedures to achieve a lower rank solution. Then we show that the SDP relaxation of three classes of optimal beamforming problem always has a rank-one solution, which can be obtained by invoking the rank reduction procedures.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2031732","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2031732","startPage":"664","endPage":"678","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5379139/05233822.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rank-Constrained Separable Semidefinite Programming With Applications to Optimal Beamforming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5233822/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Rank-Constrained Separable Semidefinite Programming With Applications to Optimal Beamforming","volume":"58","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11054893","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5233822/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rank-Constrained Separable Semidefinite Programming With Applications to Optimal Beamforming","sourcePdf":"58tsp02-yhuang-2031732.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098688S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5379139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"373","xplore-issue":"5379139","articleId":"5233822","onlineDate":"09 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5233823,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Shiun Wang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5272819/5233823/5233823-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chao-Shiun-Wang (M'04) received the B.S.E.E. and the M.S.E.E. degrees from the National Central University, Chung-Li, Taiwan, in 1997 and 1999, respectively.","From 1999 to 2004, he was with SoC Technology Center of ITRI, Hsinchu, Taiwan, working on CMOS RFIC design.

The proposed control technique retains the benefit of the hysteresis control having fast dynamic response and tackles the drawback of the standard hysteresis control having variable switching frequency. The concept is based on predicting the current reference, system dynamic behavior, and past time to formulate the switching function for dictating the switching times of the switches in the inverter within a predefined switching period. Of particular importance, no hysteresis bandwidth (a challenge in the practical implementation) is needed in the entire control method. The operating principles of the proposed technique and mathematical derivation of the switching functions will be given. The proposed method is successfully applied to a 300 W, 110 V, 60 Hz grid-connected VSI prototype with the controller implemented by a simple analog circuit. The steady-state and large-signal dynamic response of the VSI are studied. Experimental results show that the inverter can reach the steady state in two switching actions after the inverter is subject to large-signal input and output disturbances.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2031804","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5338051/05233830.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338051","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2031804","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","startPage":"2484","endPage":"2495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constant-Frequency Hysteresis Current Control of Grid-Connected VSI Without Bandwidth Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5233830","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Constant-Frequency Hysteresis Current Control of Grid-Connected VSI Without Bandwidth Control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5233830/","volume":"24","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5233830/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11003591","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constant-Frequency Hysteresis Current Control of Grid-Connected VSI Without Bandwidth Control","sourcePdf":"tpel-ho-2031804.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106304S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5338051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"138","xplore-issue":"5338051","articleId":"5233830","onlineDate":"09 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5233835,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Pierre Berenger","affiliation":["Centre d''Analyse de D\u00e9fense, Arcueil, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5338646/5233835/5233835-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jean-Pierre B\u00e9renger (F'09) received the Masters degree in Physics from the University Joseph Fourier, Grenoble, France, in 1973, and the Masters degree in Optical Engineering from the Institut d'Optique Graduate School (formerly Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure d'Optique), Paris, France, in 1975.","From 1975 to 1984, he was with the D\u00e9partement Etudes Th\u00e9oriques, Centre d'Analyse de D\u00e9fense, France, where his domains of interest were the propagation of waves and the coupling problems related to the nuclear electromagnetic pulse.

This solution is developed in two steps. First, we describe an adaptive beamforming technique that, using a stochastic gradient method, maximizes the power delivered to a mobile terminal. In the proposed solution, perturbed precoding matrices are time multiplexed in the information signal transmitted to a mobile terminal; then, the mobile terminal informs the transmitter, via a single feedback bit, about the perturbation delivering the larger power. This approach does not need pilot symbols and uses quasi-Monte Carlo methods to generate the required perturbations with the relevant advantages of improving the downlink spectral efficiency and reducing the system complexity with respect to other competing solutions. Then, we propose a novel power-control algorithm that, selecting a proper transmission energy level from a set of possible values, aims to minimize the average bit error rate. This set of levels is generated on the basis of the channel statistics and a long-term constraint on the average transmission power. Numerical results evidence the robustness of the proposed algorithms in a dynamic fading environment.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5383378/05233860.pdf","startPage":"225","endPage":"234","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2031970","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2031970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383378","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5233860","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Rate-Feedback-Assisted Beamforming and Power Control for MIMO-OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Power control","Downlink","MIMO","Frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","Stochastic processes","Gradient methods","Transmitters","Feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","error statistics","MIMO systems","Monte Carlo methods","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-rate-feedback-assisted beamforming","MIMO-OFDM systems","multiple input multiple output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","adaptive beamforming technique","stochastic gradient method","perturbed precoding matrices","quasi-Monte Carlo methods","power-control algorithm","channel statistics","dynamic fading","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive transmissions","beamforming","low-rate feedback","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","power control","quasi\u2013Monte Carlo (QMC)","stochastic gradient algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5233860/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Low-Rate-Feedback-Assisted Beamforming and Power Control for MIMO-OFDM Systems","volume":"59","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5233860/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11070308","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Rate-Feedback-Assisted Beamforming and Power Control for MIMO-OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-vitetta-2031970.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080233S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5383378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5383378","articleId":"5233860","onlineDate":"09 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5233863,"authors":[{"name":"Ignacio Egido","affiliation":["Escuela T\u00e9cnica Superior de Ingenier\u00eda (ICAI), Universidad Pontificia Comillas de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/5282387/5233863/5233863-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ignacio Egido was born in Ar\u00e9valo (\u00c1vila), Spain, in 1976.

The maximum frequency deviation in the system is limited to prevent other generator tripping. It is important to have an accurate model to calculate it, both for system planning and operation. A new simplified model to calculate the maximum frequency deviation when either a generator or load-related disturbance occurs in these systems is presented. This model takes into account the response of governor-prime mover even when different technologies are present in the power system. Model parameters can be easily obtained from either more complex models or from test records. Simulation results for an actual power system aimed at checking the model accuracy are presented. High accuracy is obtained while computation time is reduced due to the simplicity of the model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5233863/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","volume":"24","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10929431","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5233863/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Maximum Frequency Deviation Calculation in Small Isolated Power Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum Frequency Deviation Calculation in Small Isolated Power Systems","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-egido-2030399.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089757S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5282387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"5282387","articleId":"5233863","onlineDate":"09 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":5233865,"authors":[{"name":"Milton Brown Do Coutto Filho","affiliation":["Institute of Computing, Fluminense Federal University (UFF), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"],"firstName":"Milton Brown","lastName":"Do Coutto Filho","id":"37435431500"},{"name":"Julio Cesar Stacchini de Souza","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Fluminense Federal University (UFF), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"],"firstName":"Julio Cesar","lastName":"Stacchini de Souza","id":"37271679400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8950"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0679"}],"articleNumber":"5233865","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":132,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2179},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["State estimation","Art","Random processes","Power system measurements","Power measurement","Redundancy","Technological innovation","Data analysis","Observability","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy management systems","load forecasting","power system state estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forecasting-aided state estimation","power system state estimation process","forecasting capability","data redundancy","innovation analysis","parameter error processing","network configuration","energy management system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["State estimation","state forecasting"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5233865","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5282387/05233865.pdf","startPage":"1667","endPage":"1677","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2030295","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2030295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5282387","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forecasting-Aided State Estimation\u2014Part I: Panorama","abstract":"The art of estimating future values of a random process, based upon previously observed or estimated values, is usually known as \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a priori</i>\n estimation, prediction, or forecasting.

As device dimensions and supply voltages continue to scale down, it is increasingly critical to determine a suitable op-amp dc gain. If the dc gain is set too high, then the op-amp consumes too much power; if the dc gain is too small, then nonlinear distortion becomes serious. However, there exists no efficient approach for selecting dc gains. In this brief, we propose to use a nonlinear function to model nonlinear op-amp dc gain curves. Then, this nonlinear function is employed to derive an SDM nonlinear distortion model as a function of SDM system parameters. The obtained SDM nonlinear distortion model can subsequently be used to compute the minimum required op-amp dc gain such that nonlinear distortions are kept under a tolerable value. The nonlinear dc gain curve model and the SDM nonlinear distortion model proposed in this brief are verified by behavior simulations and transistor-level simulations. </para>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5233868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10864351","volume":"56","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modeling Harmonic Distortions Caused by Nonlinear Op-Amp DC Gain for Switched-Capacitor Sigma\u2013Delta Modulators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling Harmonic Distortions Caused by Nonlinear Op-Amp DC Gain for Switched-Capacitor Sigma\u2013Delta Modulators","sourcePdf":"tcsii-chen-2027956.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040073S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","isNumber":"5235151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"10","articleId":"5233868","onlineDate":"09 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":5233871,"authors":[{"name":"Onur Dikmen","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5410050/5233871/5233871-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Onur Dikmen (M'09) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degree in computer engineering from Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University, Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i, Turkey.

This can be accomplished in the Bayesian framework through the use of appropriate prior distributions. In this paper, we describe a class of prior models called Gamma Markov random fields (GMRFs) to model the sparsity and the local dependency of the energies (i.e., variances) of time-frequency expansion coefficients. A GMRF model describes a non-normalised joint distribution over unobserved variance variables, where given the field the actual source coefficients are independent. Our construction ensures a positive coupling between the variance variables, so that signal energy changes smoothly over both axes to capture the temporal and spectral continuity. The coupling strength is controlled by a set of hyperparameters. Inference on the overall model is convenient because of the conditional conjugacy of all of the variables in the model, but automatic optimization of hyperparameters is crucial to obtain better fits. The marginal likelihood of the model is not available because of the intractable normalizing constant of GMRFs. In this paper, we optimize the hyperparameters of our GMRF-based audio model using contrastive divergence and compare this method to alternatives such as score matching and pseudolikelihood maximization where applicable. We present the performance of the GMRF models in denoising and single-channel source separation problems in completely blind scenarios, where all the hyperparameters are jointly estimated given only audio data.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2009.2031778","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5410050/05233871.pdf","startPage":"589","endPage":"601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410050","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2009.2031778","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Gamma Markov Random Fields for Audio Source Modeling","volume":"18","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5233871/","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11105647","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5233871/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gamma Markov Random Fields for Audio Source Modeling","sourcePdf":"18tasl02-odikmen-2031778.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082857S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5410050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5410050","articleId":"5233871","onlineDate":"09 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":5233874,"authors":[{"name":"Ping-Ching Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5440038/5233874/5233874-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ping-Ching Huang (S\u201909) was born in Taipei, Taiwan.

Besides, the hybrid buck-boost feedforward (HBBFF) technique is integrated in this converter to achieve fast line response. The new control topology minimizes the switching and conduction losses at the same time even when four switches are used. Therefore, over a wide input voltage range, the proposed buck-boost converter with minimum switching loss like the buck or boost converter can reduce the conduction loss through the use of the reduced average inductor current (RAIC) technique. Moreover, the HBBFF technique minimizes the voltage variation at the output of error amplifier. Consequently, a fast line transient response can be achieved with small dropout voltage at the output. Especially, the converter can offer good line and load regulations to ensure a regulated output voltage without being affected by the decreasing battery voltage. Experimental results show that the output voltage is regulated over a wide battery lifetime, and the output ripple is minimized during mode transition. The peak efficiency is 97% and the transient dropout voltage can be improved substantially.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5440038/05233874.pdf","startPage":"719","endPage":"730","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2031803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2031803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5440038","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Buck\u2013Boost Feedforward and Reduced Average Inductor Current Techniques in Fast Line Transient and High-Efficiency Buck\u2013Boost Converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5233874/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Buck\u2013Boost Feedforward and Reduced Average Inductor Current Techniques in Fast Line Transient and High-Efficiency Buck\u2013Boost Converter","htmlLink":"/document/5233874/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","accessionNumber":"11208083","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Buck\u2013Boost Feedforward and Reduced Average Inductor Current Techniques in Fast Line Transient and High-Efficiency Buck\u2013Boost Converter","sourcePdf":"tpel-chen-2031803.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081204S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5440038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"5440038","articleId":"5233874","onlineDate":"09 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5233878,"authors":[{"name":"Kaushik Mysore","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Kaushik Mysore received the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from Mysore University, Karnataka, India, in 2001 and the M.S. degree in mechanical engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, in 2005.

Primary creep in Sn3.0Ag0.5Cu solder alloy is shown to be significant and are considered in addition to secondary creep and monotonic behavior. Aging influence on behavior is also shown to be significant. On the basis of experimental data, the following four aspects are discussed: 1) difference between testing on bulk versus joint specimen; 2) consistency between the creep and monotonic behaviors; 3) comparison against behaviors of Sn1.0Ag0.5Cu and Sn3.8Ag0.7Cu alloys as well as aganist Sn40Pb, 62Sn36Pb2Ag and 96.5Sn3.5Ag alloys; and 4) comparison of Sn3.0Ag0.5Cu and Sn3.8Ag0.7Cu relative to their aging response.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5233878/","volume":"32","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5233878/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10917766","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Constitutive and Aging Behavior of Sn3.0Ag0.5Cu Solder Alloy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constitutive and Aging Behavior of Sn3.0Ag0.5Cu Solder Alloy","sourcePdf":"tepm-gsubbarayan-2024119.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074922S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6104","isNumber":"5261115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6104","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"5261115","articleId":"5233878","onlineDate":"09 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5233880,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Hao Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Hao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37899954400"},{"name":"Chien-Ching Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chien-Ching","lastName":"Lin","id":"37278413200"},{"name":"Shau-Wei Yen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan","Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shau-Wei","lastName":"Yen","id":"37895005700"},{"name":"Chih-Lung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan","Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Lung","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293076300"},{"name":"Hsie-Chia Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan","Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsie-Chia","lastName":"Chang","id":"37280773500"},{"name":"Chen-Yi Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan","Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chen-Yi","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280413800"},{"name":"Yar-Sun Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yar-Sun","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37531406900"},{"name":"Shyh-Jye Jou","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shyh-Jye","lastName":"Jou","id":"37270102100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"5233880","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":633},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Parity check codes","Hardware","Sparse matrices","Matrix decomposition","Switches","Routing","Transportation","CMOS process","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","decoding","message passing","parity check codes","telecommunication network routing","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimode QC-LDPC decoder","shift-routing network","reconfigurable message-passing network","message transportation","multimode quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check codes","IEEE 802.16e","IEEE 802.11n","hardware complexity","CMOS process","postlayout simulation","codeword streams"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Architecture","IEEE 802.11n","IEEE 802.16e","message passing","network","quasi-cyclic low-density parity check (QC-LDPC)","WiMax"]}],"abstract":"A reconfigurable message-passing network is proposed to facilitate message transportation in decoding multimode quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes.

In order to evaluate the measurement-based load model, the probabilistic collocation method (PCM) is applied to quantitatively analyze uncertainties of the simulation responses raised by the parameters.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2030298","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5282387/05233886.pdf","startPage":"1756","endPage":"1764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2030298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5282387","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Real Application of Measurement-Based Load Modeling in Large-Scale Power Grids and its Validation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5233886","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5233886/","displayDocTitle":"A Real Application of Measurement-Based Load Modeling in Large-Scale Power Grids and its Validation","volume":"24","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10929438","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5233886/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Real Application of Measurement-Based Load Modeling in Large-Scale Power Grids and its Validation","sourcePdf":"24tpwrs04-dhan-2030298.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078298S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5282387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"5282387","articleId":"5233886","onlineDate":"09 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5233898,"authors":[{"name":"Jhe-Jia Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jhe-Jia","lastName":"Kuo","id":"37575803300"},{"name":"Zuo-Min Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Zuo-Min","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37301805900"},{"name":"Ping-Chen Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ping-Chen","lastName":"Huang","id":"37696754400"},{"name":"Chau-Ching Chiong","affiliation":["Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chau-Ching","lastName":"Chiong","id":"37317473000"},{"name":"Kun-You Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kun-You","lastName":"Lin","id":"37277928800"},{"name":"Huei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Huei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280092300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"5233898","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":701},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5233898","abstract":"Usually the tuning range of voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) is much narrower than the possible resonant frequency range of the tank at different tuning voltages. In this letter we analyze the traditional common-base type VCO, give a simple but useful insight about the mechanism behind the topology, and verified the conclusions with a 2 mum heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) VCO. The results show that with the CB configuration, proper feedback inductor and wide tuning range varactor, the tuning range can be almost the same as the resonant frequency range of the tank at different tuning voltages. A wideband voltage controlled oscillator using a commercial 2 mum HBT technology is designed, fabricated and measured. The varactor with wide range of capacitance is used to achieve 53.33% measured tuning range from 9.46 to 16.34 GHz. The measured phase noise at 1 MHz offset is between -90 and -102 dBc/Hz.

We next introduce the integrated perturbation analysis and sequential quadratic programming (InPA-SQP) method to solve the constrained optimal control problem with sub-millisecond level sampling time. The InPA-SQP solver can meet the computational efficiency demand, thereby enabling implementation of an implicit MPC for power electronics system with fast dynamics.

At a spectral efficiency of 6.2 b/s/Hz (16.67-GHz WDM channel spacing) a transmission reach of 630 km is attained.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrally Efficient Long-Haul Optical Networking Using 112-Gb/s Polarization-Multiplexed 16-QAM","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2031922","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5401119/05233904.pdf","startPage":"547","endPage":"556","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2031922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401119","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5233904","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5233904/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2010","displayDocTitle":"Spectrally Efficient Long-Haul Optical Networking Using 112-Gb/s Polarization-Multiplexed 16-QAM","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5233904/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2010","accessionNumber":"11136012","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrally Efficient Long-Haul Optical Networking Using 112-Gb/s Polarization-Multiplexed 16-QAM","sourcePdf":"jlt-pwinzer-2031922.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091348S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2010","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5401119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"239","xplore-issue":"5401119","articleId":"5233904","onlineDate":"09 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5233905,"authors":[{"name":"Di Zhao","affiliation":["Motion (RIM) Limited, Sunrise, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5440038/5233905/5233905-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Di Zhao (M'09) received the M.S. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, P.R.

Other special cases of the GTD-TC are the geometric mean decomposition (GMD) and the bidiagonal decomposition (BID) transform coders. The GMD-TC in particular has the property that the optimum bit allocation is a uniform allocation; this is because all its transform domain coefficients have the same variance, implying thereby that the dynamic ranges of the coefficients to be quantized are identical.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5379139/05233910.pdf","startPage":"566","endPage":"574","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2031733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2031733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379139","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5233910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Triangular Decomposition in Transform Coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transform coding","Karhunen-Loeve transforms","Bit rate","Context","Dynamic range","Autocorrelation","Matrix decomposition","Quantization","Decorrelation","Councils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Karhunen-Loeve transforms","transform coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized triangular decomposition","transform coding","optimal transform coders","Karhunen-Loeve transform","prediction-based lower triangular transform","optimal bit allocation","scalar wide sense stationary processes","GTD-based family","MINLAB structure","unit noise-gain property","GTD-TC","geometric mean decomposition","bidiagonal decomposition transform coders","optimum bit allocation","transform domain coefficients","linear prediction","Schur convexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit allocation","generalized triangular decomposition","geometric mean decomposition","linear prediction","majorization","Schur convexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5233910/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Triangular Decomposition in Transform Coding","volume":"58","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5233910/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11054921","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Triangular Decomposition in Transform Coding","sourcePdf":"58tsp02-cweng-2031733.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085131S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5379139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5379139","articleId":"5233910","onlineDate":"09 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5233917,"authors":[{"name":"Petar J.

The RB IGBT is a specially designed IGBT having ability to sustain blocking voltage of both the polarities. Such a switch shows superior conduction but much worst switching (turn- on) performances compared to a combination of an ordinary IGBT and blocking diode. Because of that, optimization of the switching performance is a key issue that makes the RB IGB not well accepted in the real applications. In this paper, the RB IGBT turn-on losses and reverse recovery current are analyzed for different gate driver techniques, and a new gate driver is proposed. Commonly used conventional gate drivers do not have capability for the switching dynamics optimization. In contrast to this, the new proposed gate driver provides robust and simple way to control and optimize the reverse recovery current and turn-on losses. The collector current slope and reverse recovery current are controlled by the means of the gate emitter voltage control in feedforward manner. In addition, the collector emitter voltage slope is controlled during the voltage falling phase by the means of inherent increase of the gate current. Therefore, the collector emitter voltage tail and the total turn- on losses are reduced, independently on the reverse recovery current. The proposed gate driver was experimentally verified and the results presented and discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turn-<emphasis emphasistype=\"smcaps\">on</emphasis> Performance of Reverse Blocking IGBT (RB IGBT) and Optimization Using Advanced Gate Driver","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2031805","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5443664/05233917.pdf","startPage":"970","endPage":"980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2031805","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5443664","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5233917","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5233917/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"Turn-<emphasis emphasistype=\"smcaps\">on</emphasis> Performance of Reverse Blocking IGBT (RB IGBT) and Optimization Using Advanced Gate Driver","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5233917/","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11228323","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turn-<emphasis emphasistype=\"smcaps\">on</emphasis> Performance of Reverse Blocking IGBT (RB IGBT) and Optimization Using Advanced Gate Driver","sourcePdf":"tpel-grbovic-2031805.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144735S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5443664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5443664","articleId":"5233917","onlineDate":"09 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5233918,"authors":[{"name":"Huai-Ning Wu","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5280548/5233918/5233918-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huai-Ning Wu was born in Anhui, China, on November 15, 1972.

Binary phase shift keying (BPSK) format is considered as the label. An identifying bit is placed ahead of the address bits in the label. The label recognition system consists of a tree-structure connection of asymmetric X-junction couplers. The system uses self-routing propagation of the identification bit controlled by the address bits. Asymmetric X-junction couplers have a feature of small dependence on wavelength. However, the wavelength dependence of optical circuits consisting of multiple asymmetric X-junction couplers depends strongly on its architecture. In this paper, we propose a wavelength insensitive architecture of the recognition circuit. The wavelength independence in the improved circuit is confirmed using finite-difference beam propagation method (FD-BPM). We numerically demonstrate that our proposed system can recognize all the binary-code labels in wavelength range of 1500-1600 nm with crosstalk less than -25 dB and -15 dB for label length three and four, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2031879","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5290263/05233929.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2031879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290263","startPage":"5543","endPage":"5551","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelength-Insensitive Integrated-Optic Circuit Consisting of Asymmetric X-Junction Couplers for Recognition of BPSK Labels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5233929","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wavelength-Insensitive Integrated-Optic Circuit Consisting of Asymmetric X-Junction Couplers for Recognition of BPSK Labels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15,  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5233929/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"24","publicationDate":"Dec.15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10974638","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5233929/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelength-Insensitive Integrated-Optic Circuit Consisting of Asymmetric X-Junction Couplers for Recognition of BPSK Labels","sourcePdf":"jlt-ngoto-2031879.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093989S","chronDate":"Dec.15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5290263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5290263","articleId":"5233929","onlineDate":"09 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5233940,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It has, until recently, been largely inapplicable to real-time applications due to its computationally expensive nature. This paper presents a new reliable flow technique which is combined with a motion detection algorithm, from stationary camera image streams, to allow flow-based analyses of moving entities, such as rigidity, in real-time. The combination of the optical flow analysis with motion detection technique greatly reduces the expensive computation of flow vectors as compared with standard approaches, rendering the method to be applicable in real-time implementation. This paper describes also the hardware implementation of a proposed pipelined system to estimate the flow vectors from image sequences in real time. This design can process 768 times 576 images at a very high frame rate that reaches to 156 fps in a single low cost FPGA chip, which is adequate for most real-time vision applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 National Radio Science Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5210443/5233433/05233940.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2009 National Radio Science Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5233433","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5233940","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A reliable FPGA-based real-time optical-flow estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image motion analysis","Motion detection","Cameras","Streaming media","Image analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Optical computing","Rendering (computer graphics)","Hardware","Image sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","image sequences","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based real-time optical-flow estimation","flow technique reliability","motion detection algorithm","stationary camera image streams","moving entities","flow vectors","pipelined system","image sequences"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5233940/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"A reliable FPGA-based real-time optical-flow estimation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5233940/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10862079","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2009","conferenceDate":"17-19 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A reliable FPGA-based real-time optical-flow estimation","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"D13AReliableFPGAbasedRealtimeOpticalflowEstima.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072009S","chronDate":"17-19 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5210443","isNumber":"5233433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5210443","xplore-issue":"5233433","articleId":"5233940","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"NRSC","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5233942,"authors":[{"name":"Mazhar B.

We can think of a CR as having three main parts: the ability to sense, the capacity to learn, and the capability to adapt. Adaptation to the outside environment to optimize radio parameters has been previously proposed using genetic algorithms (GA) to select the optimal transmission parameters by scoring a subset of parameters and evolving them until the optimal value is reached for a given goal. However, the time required for the genetic algorithms to find a solution increases as the system complexity grows, as in multicarrier (MC) systems. In this paper, we propose a new faster algorithm based on a hybrid of binary-coded particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm (HBPGA). The new algorithm is compared to GA, and the binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO), simulation results show that it performs better than both in terms of convergence speed and converged fitness value.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 National Radio Science Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5210443/5233433/05233975.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5233433","publicationTitle":"2009 National Radio Science Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid of particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm for multicarrier Cognitive Radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5233975","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid of particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm for multicarrier Cognitive Radio","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5233975/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5233975/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10862109","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2009","conferenceDate":"17-19 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid of particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm for multicarrier Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"C28AHybridofParticleSwarmOptimizationandGeneticAl.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047296S","chronDate":"17-19 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5210443","isNumber":"5233433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5210443","xplore-issue":"5233433","articleId":"5233975","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"NRSC","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5233992,"authors":[{"name":"Nazmy Azzam","affiliation":["Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport, Alexandria, Egypt"],"firstName":"Nazmy","lastName":"Azzam","id":"37086657775"},{"name":"Moustafa H.

SDR architecture has been proposed as a solution to support multiple wireless standards on a single platform. In this paper, we present the architecture of an all-digital transmitter with radio frequency (RF) output targeting FPGA devices due to their reconfigurability and reprogrammability. The all-digital transmitter directly synthesizes RF signal in the digital domain using Low Pass Delta Sigma Modulation (LPDSM). This eliminates the need for most of the analog and RF components. The all digital transmitter consists of one Cascaded Integrator Comb (CIC) filter, one LPDSM modulator and Digital Upconverter (DUC). The binary output waveform from the RF-DeltaSigma modulator is centered at 800MHz with bit rate of 1.6 Gbps. The proposed architecture has been simulated to prove the idea and test its performance. Finally, the proposed architecture is designed using VHDL design entry and ready for download on the target FPGA.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 National Radio Science Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5210443/5233433/05233994.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2009 National Radio Science Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5233433","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5233994","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA prototyping of digital RF transmitter employing Delta Sigma modulation for SDR","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Prototypes","Radio frequency","Delta-sigma modulation","Radio transmitters","Computer architecture","Software prototyping","Software radio","Radio transceivers","Signal synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delta-sigma modulation","field programmable gate arrays","radio transmitters","software radio","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA prototyping","digital RF transmitter","delta sigma modulation","software defined radio","radio transceiver","cascaded integrator comb filter","LPDSM modulator","digital upconverter","binary output waveform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["All Digital Transmitter","CIC filter","CORDIC","low pass Delta Sigma Modulator","SDR","DDFS","NCO","MGT"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5233994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"FPGA prototyping of digital RF transmitter employing Delta Sigma modulation for SDR","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5233994/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10862127","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2009","conferenceDate":"17-19 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA prototyping of digital RF transmitter employing Delta Sigma modulation for SDR","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"C08FPGAPrototypingofDigitalRFTransmitterEmploying.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053002S","chronDate":"17-19 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5210443","isNumber":"5233433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5210443","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5233433","articleId":"5233994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"NRSC","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5233997,"authors":[{"name":"Najib A.

The digital architecture for the BPSK demodulator allows for much less power consumption compared with prior art. The basic premise of the demodulation is to regenerate the incoming BPSK signal using a digital phase-locked loop. We demonstrate the silicon realization of the BPSK demodulator operating at 13.56 MHz in a 0.5-mum complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor process with power consumption of 2.3 mW. The silicon area is 536 times 546 mum\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n. A novel multilevel LSK for passive back telemetry is implemented, and it works by modulating the load impedance at the implant to create distinct reflections at the primary coil of the reader. The reflections at the reader are decoded for data information using a discrete realization of highly sensitive LSK receiver. The simulation and measurement results indicate 2times improvement in data rate compared with conventional bilevel back telemetry. This brief also shows the implementation of a forward BPSK modulator based on a class-E power amplifier to complete a full biomedical implant transceiver implementation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/5235151/05234043.pdf","startPage":"714","endPage":"718","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2009.2027968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2009.2027968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235151","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5234043","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fully Digital BPSK Demodulator and Multilevel LSK Back Telemetry for Biomedical Implant Transceivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Binary phase shift keying","Demodulation","Back","Telemetry","Implants","Transceivers","Energy consumption","Silicon","Reflection","Art"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical communication","CMOS integrated circuits","demodulators","digital phase locked loops","phase shift keying","prosthetics","telemetry","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary-phase-shift-keying","BPSK demodulator","multilevel load-shift-keying back telemetry","biomedical implant transceivers","digital phase locked loops","complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor process","frequency 13.56 MHz","size 0.5 mum","power 2 mW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) demodulator","biomedical implanted transceiver","digital phase-locked loop (DPLL)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5234043/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fully Digital BPSK Demodulator and Multilevel LSK Back Telemetry for Biomedical Implant Transceivers","volume":"56","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5234043/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10864352","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fully Digital BPSK Demodulator and Multilevel LSK Back Telemetry for Biomedical Implant Transceivers","sourcePdf":"tcsii-xu-2027968.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048668S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"5235151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5235151","articleId":"5234043","onlineDate":"09 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5234044,"authors":[{"name":"Jesse Berent","affiliation":["Communications and Signal Processing Group, Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5379139/5234044/5234044-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jesse Berent (M\u201906) received the Dipl.Ing. degree in microengineering from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland, in 2004 and the Ph.D. degree from the Communications and Signal Processing Group, Imperial College London, U.K., in 2008.","From 2008 to 2009, he was a Postdoctoral Researcher at Imperial College London.

Classical sampling theory does not enable perfect reconstruction of such signals since they are not band-limited.

In this paper, we show that under certain hypotheses on the sampling kernel, it is possible to perfectly recover the parameters that define the piecewise sinusoidal signal from its sampled version. In particular, we show that, at least theoretically, it is possible to recover piecewise sine waves with arbitrarily high frequencies and arbitrarily close switching points. Extensions of the method are also presented such as the recovery of combinations of piecewise sine waves and polynomials. Finally, we study the effect of noise and present a robust reconstruction algorithm that is stable down to SNR levels of 7 [dB].","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2031717","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5379139/05234044.pdf","startPage":"613","endPage":"625","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2031717","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling Piecewise Sinusoidal Signals With Finite Rate of Innovation Methods","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Sampling Piecewise Sinusoidal Signals With Finite Rate of Innovation Methods","volume":"58","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5234044/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11054901","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5234044/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling Piecewise Sinusoidal Signals With Finite Rate of Innovation Methods","sourcePdf":"58tsp02-jberent-2031717.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073929S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5379139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5379139","articleId":"5234044","onlineDate":"09 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5234045,"authors":[{"name":"Fangyue Chen","affiliation":["School of Science, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Zhejiang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5280548/5234045/5234045-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fangyue Chen received the graduate courses diploma in applied mathematics from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 1986 and the Ph.D. degree in operations research and control theory from Shanghai University, Shanghai, China, in 2004.","Currently, he is Full Professor at the School of Science, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Zhejiang, China.

In the classification of BFs, there are: 1) linearly separable Boolean function (LSBF) class, 2) parity Boolean function (PBF) class, and 3) non-LSBF and non-PBF class. To implement these functions, UP takes different kinds of simple topological structures in which each contains at most one hidden layer along with the smallest possible number of hidden neurons. Inspired by the concept of DNA sequences in biological systems, a novel learning algorithm named DNA-like learning is developed, which is able to quickly train a network with any prescribed BF. The focus is on performing LSBF and PBF by a single-layer perceptron (SLP) with the new algorithm. Two criteria for LSBF and PBF are proposed, respectively, and a new measure for a BF, named nonlinearly separable degree (NLSD), is introduced. In the sense of this measure, the PBF is the most complex one. The new algorithm has many advantages including, in particular, fast running speed, good robustness, and no need of considering the convergence property. For example, the number of iterations and computations in implementing the basic 2-bit logic operations such as and, or, and xor by using the new algorithm is far smaller than the ones needed by using other existing algorithms such as error-correction (EC) and backpropagation (BP) algorithms. Moreover, the synaptic weights and threshold values derived from UP can be directly used in designing of the template of cellular neural networks (CNNs), which has been considered as a new spatial-temporal sensory computing paradigm.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2009.2028886","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5280548/05234045.pdf","startPage":"1645","endPage":"1658","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2009.2028886","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5280548","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Universal Perceptron and DNA-Like Learning Algorithm for Binary Neural Networks: LSBF and PBF Implementations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5234045/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Universal Perceptron and DNA-Like Learning Algorithm for Binary Neural Networks: LSBF and PBF Implementations","volume":"20","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10909748","pubMedId":"23460987","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5234045/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Universal Perceptron and DNA-Like Learning Algorithm for Binary Neural Networks: LSBF and PBF Implementations","sourcePdf":"tnn-chen-2028886.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145994S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5280548","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5280548","articleId":"5234045","onlineDate":"09 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5234083,"authors":[{"name":"Argon Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Argon","lastName":"Chen","id":"37365898600"},{"name":"Sean Hsueh","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sean","lastName":"Hsueh","id":"37890761600"},{"name":"Jakey Blue","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Natinal Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jakey","lastName":"Blue","id":"37411095100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4578-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4579-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-8070"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-8089"}],"articleNumber":"5234083","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5234083","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Metrology","Manufacturing processes","Semiconductor device manufacture","Process design","Fabrication","Time measurement","Etching","Throughput","Linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering","integer programming","integrated circuit manufacture","integrated circuit measurement","integrated circuit testing","sampling methods","semiconductor industry","spatial variables measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimum sampling","track PEB CD integrated metrology","critical dimension metrology","integrated metrology","control algorithms","lithographic process","etch process","coater-developer track systems","wafer-level control","APC constraints","SPC constraints","integer programming problem","tool queue time","integrated circuit testing","semiconductor manufacturing","statistical process control","advanced process control"]}],"abstract":"In semiconductor manufacturing, metrology of critical dimension (CD) is to ensure the quality of complicated processing steps and thus the quality of the fabricated chips by discovering faults or improvement opportunities. CD metrology has been considered the integrated part of the IC design and fabrication processes. Integrated Metrology (IM) is an enabler to achieve wafer-level control for technology nodes below 45 nm because of its capability of using the tool queue time to collect CD measurements and to avoid sampling lag to the control algorithms. How to maneuver the CD IM capability becomes a great challenge to the litho/etch processes. Focus of this research will be on the CD IM for the coater/developer track systems. We develop an IM sampling strategy with an optimum sampling plan to maximize the wafer-level control effectiveness subjected to the throughput, APC and SPC constraints. The optimum sampling problem is formulated and solved as an integer programming problem.

The formulation of the JSP is based on the assumption that for each part type or job there is only one process plan that prescribes the sequence of operations and the machine on which each operation has to be performed. Flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) is an extension of the JSP, which allows an operation to be processed by any machine from a given set. Since FJSP requires an additional decision of machine allocation during scheduling, therefore it is much more complex problem than JSP. To solve such NP-hard problems, heuristic approaches are commonly preferred over the traditional mathematical techniques. This paper proposes a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based heuristic for solving the FJSP for minimum makespan time criterion. The performance of the proposed PSO is evaluated by comparing its results with the results obtained using ILOG Solver, a constraint-programming tool. The comparison of the results proves the effectiveness of the proposed PSO for solving FJSP instances.","doi":"10.1109/COASE.2009.5234153","pdfPath":"/iel5/5227795/5234081/05234153.pdf","startPage":"298","endPage":"303","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COASE.2009.5234153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5234081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A particle swarm optimization algorithm for flexible job shop scheduling problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5234153/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A particle swarm optimization algorithm for flexible job shop scheduling problem","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10862233","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5234153/","conferenceDate":"22-25 Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A particle swarm optimization algorithm for flexible job shop scheduling problem","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"0098.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083881S","chronDate":"22-25 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5227795","isNumber":"5234081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5227795","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5234081","articleId":"5234153","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5234162,"authors":[{"name":"P.

for lane reservation problem in time constrained transportation","abstract":"This paper addresses a new transportation problem called lane reservation problem in time constrained transportation. It originates from large sportive events in a city or region where the travel time between sportive villages and stadium should fall in a strict time window. To guarantee the timely transportation in an already traffic saturated city, the problem consists in temporarily creating special lanes on roads in the transportation network. The objective is to minimize the total weighted cost of reserved lanes so as to minimize the traffic impact to the normal traffic situation. In this paper, this problem is formulated as an integer linear programming model. An efficient heuristic is presented to obtain near optimal solutions due to the complexity of the problem. Numerical results show that the average gap between solutions obtained by the proposed heuristic and that by a software package (Lingo 8.0) is less than 1.59% for small size instances, while the average computational time with the heuristic is less than one second. As a case study, the proposed heuristic is applied to the transportation planning in Guangzhou Asian Games.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5234190/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10862270","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","conferenceDate":"22-25 Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5234190/","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Heuristic for lane reservation problem in time constrained transportation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heuristic for lane reservation problem in time constrained transportation","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"0019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067733S","chronDate":"22-25 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5227795","isNumber":"5234081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5227795","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5234081","articleId":"5234190","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5234322,"authors":[{"name":"Nuno Antunes","affiliation":["CISUC, Department of Informatics Engineering, University of Coimbra, Portugal"],"firstName":"Nuno","lastName":"Antunes","id":"37545868600"},{"name":"Marco Vieira","affiliation":["CISUC, Department of Informatics Engineering, University of Coimbra, Portugal"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Vieira","id":"37281951900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4678-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3760-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5234322","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1155},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Web services","Testing","Databases","Application software","Performance evaluation","Data security","Simple object access protocol","Informatics","Computer bugs","Time to market"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security of data","SQL","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SQL injection vulnerabilities detection","Web services","critical software bugs","Web vulnerability scanner","security vulnerabilities"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LADC.2009.21","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5234322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LADC.2009.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5234291","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth Latin-American Symposium on Dependable Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth Latin-American Symposium on Dependable Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5234290/5234291/05234322.pdf","startPage":"17","endPage":"24","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in Web Services","abstract":"Web services are often deployed with critical software bugs that can be maliciously exploited. Web vulnerability scanners are regarded as an easy way to test Web applications against security vulnerabilities. However, previous research shows that the effectiveness of these tools in Web services environments is very poor. In fact, the high number of false-positives and the low coverage observed in practice highlight the strong limitations of these tools. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that it is possible to develop a vulnerability scanner for Web services that performs much better than the commercial ones currently available. Thus, we propose an approach to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities, one of the most common and most critical types of vulnerabilities in web environments. Experimental evaluation shows that our approach performs much better than well-known commercial tools, achieving very high detection coverage while maintaining the false positives rate quite low.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5234322/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10878426","htmlLink":"/document/5234322/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Detecting SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in Web Services","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in Web Services","confLoc":"Jo&#227;o Pessoa, Brazil","sourcePdf":"3760a017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051443S","chronDate":"1-4 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5234290","isNumber":"5234291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5234290","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5234291","articleId":"5234322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5234387,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Ma","affiliation":["School of Information and Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wei Ma","id":"37652194300"},{"name":"Mu Qing Wu","affiliation":["School of Information and Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Mu Qing Wu","id":"37535583600"},{"name":"Dong Liu","affiliation":["People''s Liberation Army Communication and Command Institute, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Dong Liu","id":"37896490000"},{"name":"Meng Ling Wang","affiliation":["Academy of Armored Forces Engineering, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Meng Ling Wang","id":"37900323500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4519-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4520-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5234387","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":632},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Cognitive radio","OFDM","Chromium","Detectors","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Wireless communication","Fading","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cognitive radio","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["user sensing","MIMO cognitive radio sensor networks","cooperative spectrum sensing","square-law-combining","low signal-to-noise ratio","OFDM signal","CR receiver","multiple antennas","energy detector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative Spectrum Sensing","energy detection","OFDM","MIMO"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider cooperative spectrum sensing in OFDM based on energy detection in MIMO cognitive radio sensor networks.

In the proposed binocular style visual system, each LGMD processes images covering a part of the wide field of view and extracts relevant visual cues as its output. The outputs from the two LGMDs are compared and translated into executable motor commands to control the wheels of the robot in real time. Stronger signal from the LGMD in one side pushes the robot away from this side step by step; therefore, the robot can navigate in a visual environment naturally with the proposed vision system. Our experiments showed that this bio-inspired system worked well in different scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2009.5234439","pdfPath":"/iel5/5227796/5234374/05234439.pdf","startPage":"105","endPage":"109","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2009.5234439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5234374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near range path navigation using LGMD visual neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5234439/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Near range path navigation using LGMD visual neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10868095","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5234439/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near range path navigation using LGMD visual neural networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"e024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103274S","chronDate":"8-11 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5227796","isNumber":"5234374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5227796","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5234374","articleId":"5234439","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5234443,"authors":[{"name":"Kritchanon Jirawanitcharoen","affiliation":["Computer and Multimedia Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Thai Chamber of Commerce, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Kritchanon","lastName":"Jirawanitcharoen","id":"37889042800"},{"name":"Supaporn Kiattisin","affiliation":["Computer and Multimedia Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Thai Chamber of Commerce, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Supaporn","lastName":"Kiattisin","id":"37547901500"},{"name":"Adisorn Leelasantitham","affiliation":["Computer and Multimedia Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Thai Chamber of Commerce, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Adisorn","lastName":"Leelasantitham","id":"37370692900"},{"name":"Prawat Chaiprapa","affiliation":["Computer and Multimedia Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Thai Chamber of Commerce, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Prawat","lastName":"Chaiprapa","id":"37427969500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4519-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4520-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5234443","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomedical imaging","Neural networks","Medical diagnostic imaging","Biomedical engineering","Knowledge engineering","Fast Fourier transforms","Medical tests","Heart","Cardiac disease","Cardiovascular diseases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","image colour analysis","medical image processing","neural nets","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tonsillitis image detection","medical knowledge","neural network","oral cavity","medical doctor diagnosis","tonsil grand dimension","tonsil grand color","two dimensional fast Fourier transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["tonsillitis","detection","neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5234443","abstract":"Tonsillitis is a disease occurring mostly in child and adults as this disease may take to the other effects.

While integrity result indicated that the content in the flash chip was modified, TCM will reject to provide trust computing services invoked from embedded processor.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A security embedded system base on TCM and FPGA","doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2009.5234634","startPage":"605","endPage":"609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2009.5234634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5234374","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5227796/5234374/05234634.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5234634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5234634/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A security embedded system base on TCM and FPGA","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5234634/","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10868217","conferenceDate":"8-11 Aug. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A security embedded system base on TCM and FPGA","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"c136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05377S","chronDate":"8-11 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5227796","isNumber":"5234374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5227796","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5234374","articleId":"5234634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5234683,"authors":[{"name":"Zaheer Ahmad","affiliation":["Center of Information Technology, Institute of Management Sciences, Hayatabad, Peshawar, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Zaheer","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"37902801800"},{"name":"Jehanzeb Khan Orakzai","affiliation":["Center of Information Technology, Institute of Management Sciences, Hayatabad, Peshawar, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Jehanzeb Khan","lastName":"Orakzai","id":"37889049800"},{"name":"Inam Shamsher","affiliation":["Center of Information Technology, Institute of Management Sciences, Hayatabad, Peshawar, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Inam","lastName":"Shamsher","id":"37889049400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4519-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4520-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5234683","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":261},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Character recognition","Feeds","Neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Robustness","Shape","Phase measurement","Phase detection","System testing","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["character recognition","feedforward neural nets","image classification","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","natural languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Urdu compound character recognition","Arabic script","feed forward neural network training","Matlab","compound character segmentation","word classification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5234683","abstract":"Urdu compound character recognition is a scarcely developed area and requires robust techniques to develop as Urdu being a family of Arabic script is cursive, right to left in nature and characters change their shapes and sizes when they are placed at initial, middle or at the end of a word.

In the segmentation phase pixels strength is measured to detect words in a sentence and joints of characters in a compound/connected word for segmentation. In the next phase these segmented characters are feeded to a trained neural network for classification and recognition, where feed forward neural network is trained on 56 different classes of characters each having 100 samples. The main purpose of the system is to test the algorithm developed for segmentation of compound characters.

These ports can be discovered by sequential port scans. For network defenders, main concern about port scans is not the stealth, but the efficiency, especially on large and complex networks. Based-on partheno-genetic algorithm, we develop a novel fast port scan method which can discover the most often open ports efficiently. During the procedure of genetic evolutions, ports with more open times survive in next scans with higher probabilities. Simulation results show that, comparing with sequential scans, the method we develop has high feasibility and efficiency in average cases.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2009.5234709","startPage":"219","endPage":"222","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2009.5234709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5234374","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5227796/5234374/05234709.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel fast port scan method using partheno-genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5234709/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A novel fast port scan method using partheno-genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5234709/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10868292","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","conferenceDate":"8-11 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Aug. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel fast port scan method using partheno-genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"c050.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044096S","chronDate":"8-11 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5227796","isNumber":"5234374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5227796","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5234374","articleId":"5234709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5234726,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyun Chen","affiliation":["Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, CN"],"firstName":"Xiaoyun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37596809300"},{"name":"Qiang Ma","affiliation":["Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, CN"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Ma","id":"37087422443"},{"name":"Talal Alkharobi","affiliation":["College of Computer Science & Engineering, KFUPM, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Talal","lastName":"Alkharobi","id":"37889106800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4519-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4520-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5234726","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":815},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5234726","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Taylor series","Gaussian processes","Transfer functions","Educational institutions","Neurons","Information science","Electronic mail","Computer science","Input variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","Fourier series","pattern clustering","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Taylor series","radial basis function neuron","Taylor component neural network","Fourier component neural network","Gauss series clustering neural network","mining"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Taylor series neural network","Taylor component neural network","Fourier component neural network","Gauss series Clustering neural network","stock price","prediction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2009.5234726","pdfPath":"/iel5/5227796/5234374/05234726.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","startPage":"291","endPage":"294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5234374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2009.5234726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New neural networks based on Taylor series and their research","abstract":"This paper is mining in the essence of neural networks, and constructing 4 types of neural networks: (1) to construct a neural network based on Taylor series;

However, time series are high dimensional and feature correlational, directly detecting anomaly patterns in its raw format is very expensive, in addition, different time series may have different lengths of anomaly patterns, and usually, the lengths of anomaly patterns is unknown. This paper presents a new conception key point and an algorithm of seeking key points, the algorithm uses key points to re-represent time series and still preserves its fundamental characteristics. Variable length method was used to segment re-represented time series into patterns and calculate anomaly scores of patterns. Anomaly patterns are identified by their anomaly scores automatically. The effectiveness of representational algorithm and anomaly detecting algorithm are demonstrated with both synthetic and standard datasets, and the experimental results confirm that our methods can identify anomaly patterns with different lengths and improve the speed of detecting algorithm greatly.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5227796/5234374/05234775.pdf","startPage":"628","endPage":"632","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2009.5234775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2009.5234775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5234374","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5234775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time series representation for anomaly detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","Mathematics","Electronic mail","Computer vision","Shape","Information analysis","Fourier transforms","Frequency domain analysis","Time measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time series representation","anomaly detection","conception key point","variable length method","re-represented time series","anomaly score","time series mining"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["time series","key points","time series representation","anomaly patterns"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5234775/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Time series representation for anomaly detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5234775/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10868358","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","conferenceDate":"8-11 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time series representation for anomaly detection","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"b138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069522S","chronDate":"8-11 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5227796","isNumber":"5234374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5227796","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5234374","articleId":"5234775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5234787,"authors":[{"name":"Heyan Huang","affiliation":["Sch. of Comput.

For visual patterns, extracting robust and discriminative features from image is the most difficult yet the most critical step. Several typical and advanced approaches of feature extraction from image are explored, some of which are analyzed in depth. Various techniques of feature extraction from image are organized in four categories: human expert knowledge based methods, image local structure based approaches, image global structure based techniques and machine learning based statistical approaches. We will show examples of applying these feature extraction approaches to solve problems of the image based biometrics, including fingerprint verification/identification and face detection/recognition. These illustrative application examples unveil the ideas, principles and advancements of feature extraction techniques and demonstrate their effectiveness and limitations in solving real-world problems.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2009.5235014","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5227796/5234374/05235014.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2009.5235014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5234374","startPage":"1","endPage":"15","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature extraction for image recognition and computer vision","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5235014","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Feature extraction for image recognition and computer vision","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235014/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10867954","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5235014/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature extraction for image recognition and computer vision","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060375S","chronDate":"8-11 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5227796","isNumber":"5234374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5227796","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5234374","articleId":"5235014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5235085,"authors":[{"name":"Mihir M.

A novel method for the design of multilayer dielectric and open loop ring resonator (OLRR) filters under constraints is presented. The proposed design method is based on generalized differential evolution (GDE3), which is a multiobjective extension of differential evolution (DE). GDE3 algorithm can be applied for global optimization to any engineering problem with an arbitrary number of objective and constraint functions. GDE3 is compared against other evolutionary multiobjective algorithms like nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and multiobjective particle swarm optimization with fitness sharing (MOPSO-fs) for a number of microwave filter design cases. In the multilayer dielectric filter design case a predefined database of low loss dielectric materials is used. The results indicate the advantages of this approach and the applicability of this design method.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2032100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2032100","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5371803/05235094.pdf","startPage":"132","endPage":"144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5371803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pareto Optimal Microwave Filter Design Using Multiobjective Differential Evolution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235094/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Pareto Optimal Microwave Filter Design Using Multiobjective Differential Evolution","volume":"58","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11069038","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5235094/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pareto Optimal Microwave Filter Design Using Multiobjective Differential Evolution","sourcePdf":"tap-goudos-2032100.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111878S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5371803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5371803","articleId":"5235094","onlineDate":"11 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5235097,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew D.

In such situations, labeled data extracted from other images modeling similar problems might be used to improve the classification accuracy. However, when training and test samples follow even slightly different distributions, classification is very difficult. This problem is known as \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">sample selection bias</i>\n. In this paper, we propose a new method to combine labeled and unlabeled pixels to increase classification reliability and accuracy. A semisupervised support vector machine classifier based on the combination of clustering and the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">mean map</i>\n kernel is proposed. The method reinforces samples in the same cluster belonging to the same class by combining sample and cluster similarities implicitly in the kernel space. A \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">soft</i>\n version of the method is also proposed where only the most reliable training samples, in terms of likelihood of the image data distribution, are used. Capabilities of the proposed method are illustrated in a cloud screening application using data from the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) instrument onboard the European Space Agency ENVISAT satellite. Cloud screening constitutes a clear example of sample selection bias since cloud features change to a great extent depending on the cloud type, thickness, transparency, height, and background. Good results are obtained and show that the method is particularly well suited for situations where the available labeled information does not adequately describe the classes in the test data.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5356246/05235101.pdf","startPage":"207","endPage":"220","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2026425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2026425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5356246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mean Map Kernel Methods for Semisupervised Cloud Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235101/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Mean Map Kernel Methods for Semisupervised Cloud Classification","htmlLink":"/document/5235101/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11025121","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mean Map Kernel Methods for Semisupervised Cloud Classification","sourcePdf":"tgrs-gomezchova-2026425.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11316S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5356246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"5356246","articleId":"5235101","onlineDate":"11 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5235113,"authors":[{"name":"Hasan Demirel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Eastern Mediterranean University, Mersin, Turkey"],"firstName":"Hasan","lastName":"Demirel","id":"37338249900"},{"name":"Gholamreza Anbarjafari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Eastern Mediterranean University, Mersin, Turkey","Faculty of Engineering, Cyprus International University, Mersin, Turkey"],"firstName":"Gholamreza","lastName":"Anbarjafari","id":"37596451000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"5235113","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":84,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2531},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellites","Image resolution","Wavelet transforms","Interpolation","Continuous wavelet transforms","Image generation","Signal resolution","PSNR","Image processing","Geoscience"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical signal processing","geophysical techniques","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["satellite image resolution enhancement technique","high-frequency subband images","dual-tree complex wavelet transform","input low-resolution satellite image","directional selectivity","peak signal-to-noise ratio","bicubic interpolation","wavelet zero padding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT)","resolution enhancement","satellite images"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, a satellite image resolution enhancement technique based on interpolation of the high-frequency subband images obtained by dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) is proposed.

The PCFLARNN consists of a number of simple small-scale Chebyshev functional link artificial recurrent neural network (CFLARNN) modules. Compared to the standard recurrent neural network (RNN), those modules of PCFLARNN can simultaneously be performed in a pipelined parallelism fashion, and this would lead to a significant improvement in its total computational efficiency. Furthermore, contrasted with the architecture of a pipelined RNN (PRNN), each module of PCFLARNN is a CFLARNN whose nonlinearity is introduced by enhancing the input pattern with Chebyshev functional expansion, whereas the RNN of each module in PRNN utilizing linear input and first-order recurrent term only fails to utilize the high-order terms of inputs. Therefore, the performance of PCFLARNN can further be improved at the cost of a slightly increased computational complexity. In addition, due to the introduced nonlinear functional expansion of each module in PRNN, the number of input signals can be reduced. Computer simulations have demonstrated that the proposed filter performs better than PRNN and RNN for nonlinear colored signal prediction, nonstationary speech signal prediction, and chaotic time series prediction.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2024313","startPage":"162","endPage":"172","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/5306448/05235119.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2024313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306448","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pipelined Chebyshev Functional Link Artificial Recurrent Neural Network for Nonlinear Adaptive Filter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chebyshev approximation","Recurrent neural networks","Adaptive filters","Pipeline processing","Parallel processing","Computational efficiency","Computer architecture","Costs","Computational complexity","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","Chebyshev filters","computational complexity","learning (artificial intelligence)","nonlinear filters","recurrent neural nets","signal processing","speech processing","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipelined Chebyshev functional link artificial recurrent neural network","nonlinear adaptive filter","modification real-time recurrent learning algorithm","computational complexity","nonlinear functional expansion","nonlinear colored signal prediction","nonstationary speech signal prediction","chaotic time series prediction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive filter","Chebyshev functional link artificial neural network (CFLANN)","pipelined architecture","pipelined recurrent neural network (PRNN)","recurrent neural network (RNN)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235119/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Pipelined Chebyshev Functional Link Artificial Recurrent Neural Network for Nonlinear Adaptive Filter","volume":"40","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5235119/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10942735","pubMedId":"19751995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pipelined Chebyshev Functional Link Artificial Recurrent Neural Network for Nonlinear Adaptive Filter","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-zhao-2024313.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084716S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5306448","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5306448","articleId":"5235119","onlineDate":"11 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5235123,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Zuo","affiliation":["HyPhen Technology Limited, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zuo","id":"37562583200"},{"name":"Lilong Cai","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Lilong","lastName":"Cai","id":"37288206200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"5235123","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":603},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5235123","abstract":"A new iterative learning control approach based on Fourier neural network (FNN) is presented for the tracking control of a class of nonlinear systems with deterministic uncertainties. The proposed controller consists of two loops. The inner loop is a feedback control action that decreases system variability and reduces the influence of random disturbances. The outer loop is an FNN-based learning controller that generates the system input to suppress the error caused by system nonlinearities and deterministic uncertainties. The FNN employs orthogonal complex Fourier exponentials as its activation functions. Therefore, it is essentially a frequency-domain method that converts the tracking problem in the time domain into a number of regulation problems in the frequency domain. Through a novel phase compensation technique, this model-free method makes it possible to use higher-frequency components in the FNN to improve the tracking performance. In addition, the structure of the FNN can be reconfigured according to the system output information to make the learning more efficient and increase the convergent speed of the tracking error. Experiments on both a commercial gear box and a belt-driven positioning table are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2026729","startPage":"458","endPage":"468","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/5431005/05235123.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2026729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5431005","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Iterative Learning Controller Using Variable Structure Fourier Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Fuzzy control","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Uncertainty","Iterative methods","Nonlinear systems","Feedback control","Control nonlinearities","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","feedback","Fourier series","iterative methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","nonlinear control systems","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative learning control method","variable structure Fourier neural network","tracking control","nonlinear system","feedback control action","system variability","random disturbances","system nonlinearities","deterministic uncertainties","orthogonal complex Fourier exponential","activation function","frequency domain method","phase compensation technique","higher frequency components","convergent speed","tracking error","gear box","belt driven positioning table"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fourier neural network (FNN)","iterative learning control (ILC)","orthogonal activation function","phase compensation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235123/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"A New Iterative Learning Controller Using Variable Structure Fourier Neural Network","volume":"40","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2010","accessionNumber":"11171918","pubMedId":"19751994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Iterative Learning Controller Using Variable Structure Fourier Neural Network","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-zuo-2026729.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044303S","chronDate":"April  2010","isNumber":"5431005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"7","articleId":"5235123","onlineDate":"11 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5235138,"authors":[{"name":"Li Hsien Yoong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/5296580/5235138/5235138-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Li Hsien Yoong received the BE degree in electronic engineering from the Multimedia University in Malaysia and the ME degree in computer systems engineering from the University of Auckland.

The standard prescribes the use of function blocks for designing systems in a component-oriented approach. The execution model of a basic function block and the manner for event/data connections between blocks are described therein. Unfortunately, the standard does not provide exhaustive specifications for function block execution. Consequently, multiple standard-compliant implementations exhibiting different behaviors are possible. This not only defeats the purpose of having a standard but also makes verification of function block systems difficult. To overcome this, we propose synchronous semantics for function blocks and show its feasibility by translating function blocks into a subset of Esterel, a well-known synchronous language. The proposed semantics avoids causal cycles common in Esterel and is proved to be reactive and deterministic under any composition. Moreover, verification techniques developed for synchronous systems can now be applied to function blocks.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5235138","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5296580/05235138.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5296580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2009.128","startPage":"1599","endPage":"1614","doi":"10.1109/TC.2009.128","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235138/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Synchronous Approach for IEC 61499 Function Block Implementation","isDynamicHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5235138/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10951117","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Synchronous Approach for IEC 61499 Function Block Implementation","sourcePdf":"ttc2009121599.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093245S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"5296580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"5296580","articleId":"5235138","onlineDate":"11 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5235150,"authors":[{"name":"Dejan Vukobratovic","affiliation":["Department of Power, Electronics and Communication Engineering, University of Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Serbia","Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/5235149/5235150/5235150-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dejan Vukobratovi\u0107 (S'02\u2013M'08) received the Dipl.-Ing. degree in electrical engineering and the Dr.-Ing. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Serbia, in 2001 and 2008, respectively.","Since 2008, he has been an Assistant Professor with the Department of Power, Electronics and Communication Engineering, University of Novi Sad.

They have recently been proposed for large scale multimedia content delivery in practical multimedia distribution systems. However, standard fountain codes, such as LT or Raptor codes, are not designed to meet unequal error protection (UEP) requirements typical in real-time scalable video multicast applications. In this paper, we propose recently introduced UEP expanding window fountain (EWF) codes as a flexible and efficient solution for real-time scalable video multicast. We demonstrate that the design flexibility and UEP performance make EWF codes ideally suited for this scenario, i.e., EWF codes offer a number of design parameters to be ldquotunedrdquo at the server side to meet the different reception criteria of heterogeneous receivers. The performance analysis using both analytical results and simulation experiments of H.264 scalable video coding (SVC) multicast to heterogeneous receiver classes confirms the flexibility and efficiency of the proposed EWF-based FEC solution.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2009.2026087","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/5235149/05235150.pdf","startPage":"1094","endPage":"1104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2009.2026087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable Video Multicast Using Expanding Window Fountain Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5235150","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235150/","displayDocTitle":"Scalable Video Multicast Using Expanding Window Fountain Codes","volume":"11","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10864332","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5235150/","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable Video Multicast Using Expanding Window Fountain Codes","sourcePdf":"11tmm06-dvukobratovic-2026087.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099755S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"5235149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"5235149","articleId":"5235150","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5235165,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Dai","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Networking Laboratory, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/5235149/5235165/5235165-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rui Dai (S'08) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, China, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.

In a densely deployed WMSN, there exists correlation among the visual information observed by cameras with overlapped field of views. This paper proposes a novel spatial correlation model for visual information in WMSNs. By studying the sensing model and deployments of cameras, a spatial correlation function is derived to describe the correlation characteristics of visual information observed by cameras with overlapped field of views. The joint effect of multiple correlated cameras is also studied. An entropy-based analytical framework is developed to measure the amount of visual information provided by multiple cameras in the network. Furthermore, according to the proposed correlation function and entropy-based framework, a correlation-based camera selection algorithm is designed. Experimental results show that the proposed spatial correlation function can model the correlation characteristics of visual information in WMSNs through low computation and communication costs. Further simulations show that, given a distortion bound at the sink, the correlation-based camera selection algorithm requires fewer cameras to report to the sink than the random selection algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235165/","volume":"11","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5235165/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10864337","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Spatial Correlation Model for Visual Information in Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Spatial Correlation Model for Visual Information in Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"11tmm06-rdai-2026100.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063099S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"5235149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"5235149","articleId":"5235165","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5235166,"authors":[{"name":"Jincheol Park","affiliation":["Wireless Network Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/5235149/5235166/5235166-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jincheol Park was born in Korea in 1982.

In this regard scalable video coding (SVC) has been actively studied due to its advantage of channel adaptation. We explore an optimal solution for maximizing the expected visual entropy over an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based broadband network from the perspective of cross-layer optimization. An optimization problem is parameterized by a set of source and channel parameters that are acquired along the user location over a multicell environment. A suboptimal solution is suggested using a greedy algorithm that allocates the radio resources to the scalable bitstreams as a function of their visual importance. The simulation results show that the greedy algorithm effectively resists ICI in the cell border region, while conventional nonscalable coding suffers severely because of ICI.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2009.2026084","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2009.2026084","startPage":"1062","endPage":"1071","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/5235149/05235166.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Channel Adaptation of Scalable Video Over a Multicarrier-Based Multicell Environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Channel Adaptation of Scalable Video Over a Multicarrier-Based Multicell Environment","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","volume":"11","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5235166/","accessionNumber":"10864338","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235166/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Channel Adaptation of Scalable Video Over a Multicarrier-Based Multicell Environment","sourcePdf":"11tmm06-slee-2026084.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068576S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"5235149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5235149","articleId":"5235166","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5235177,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Li","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Princeton University, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/5235149/5235177/5235177-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ying Li (S'07) received the B.E. degree (with honors) and the M.E. degree in electrical engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 1997 and 2000 respectively, and the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering at Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.","She is with Princeton University and has been working with Samsung Telecommunications America, Dallas, TX, since October 2008.

Given the limited network bandwidth resources, how to provide Internet users with good video playback quality-of-service (QoS) is a key problem. For video clips competing bandwidth, we propose an approach of Content-Aware distortion-Fair (CAF) video delivery scheme, which is aware of the characteristics of video frames and ensures max-min distortion-fair sharing among video flows. CAF leverages content-awareness to prioritize packet dropping during congestion. Different from bandwidth fair sharing, CAF targets end-to-end video playback quality fairness among users. The proposed CAF approach does not require rate-distortion modeling of the source, which is difficult to estimate. Instead, it exploits the temporal prediction structure of the video sequences along with a frame drop distortion metric to guide resource allocations and coordinations. Experimental results show that the proposed approach operates with limited overhead in computation and communication, and yields better QoS, especially when the network is congested.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235177/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2009","volume":"11","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"10864336","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5235177/","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Content-Aware Distortion-Fair Video Streaming in Congested Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Content-Aware Distortion-Fair Video Streaming in Congested Networks","sourcePdf":"11tmm06-yli-2026102.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.236403S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"5235149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5235149","articleId":"5235177","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5235179,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/5235149/5235179/5235179-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yan Chen (S'06) received the Bachelor's degree from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, in 2004 and the M.Phil. degree from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, in 2007.

However, most of the existing optimization-based methods, such as minimizing the weighted sum of the distortions or maximizing the weighted sum of the peak signal-to-noise ratios (PSNRs), have their weights heuristically determined. Moreover, those approaches mainly focus on the efficiency issue while there is no notion of fairness. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a game-theoretic framework, in which the utility/payoff function of each user/player is jointly determined by the characteristics of the transmitted video sequence and the allocated bit-rate. We show that a unique Nash equilibrium (NE), which is proportionally fair in terms of both utility and PSNR, can be obtained, according to which the controller can efficiently and fairly allocate the available network bandwidth to the users. Moreover, we propose a distributed cheat-proof rate allocation scheme for the users to converge to the optimal NE using alternative ascending clock auction. We also show that the traditional optimization-based approach that maximizes the weighted sum of the PSNRs is a special case of the game-theoretic framework with the utility function defined as an exponential function of PSNR. Finally, we show several experimental results on real video data to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser rate allocation games for multimedia communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2009.2026101","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/5235149/05235179.pdf","startPage":"1170","endPage":"1181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2009.2026101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235149","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5235179","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235179/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser rate allocation games for multimedia communications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5235179/","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10864330","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser rate allocation games for multimedia communications","sourcePdf":"11tmm06-ychen-2026101.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091529S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"5235149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5235149","articleId":"5235179","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5235185,"authors":[{"name":"Heather M.

Because these commercially available devices are only radiation tolerant in terms of total ionizing dose and single-event latchup, these devices must be qualified for other types of single-event effects to be used in spacecraft. Furthermore, mission requirements often dictate the need to do radiation experiments on the FPGA user circuit. Because both the circuit and the circuit's state are stored in memory that is susceptible to single-event upsets, both could be altered by the harsh space radiation environment. Both the circuit and the circuit's state can be protected by triple-modular redundancy (TMR), but applying TMR to FPGA user designs is often an error-prone process. Faulty application of TMR could cause the FPGA user circuit to output incorrect data. This paper will describe both device-level static testing and user circuit dynamic testing, including a three-tiered methodology for testing FPGA user designs for space readiness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235185/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5235185/","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10864298","volume":"58","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Test Methodology for Determining Space Readiness of Xilinx SRAM-Based FPGA Devices and Designs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Test Methodology for Determining Space Readiness of Xilinx SRAM-Based FPGA Devices and Designs","sourcePdf":"tim-quinn-2025469.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134961S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5235148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5235148","articleId":"5235185","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5235217,"authors":[{"name":"Sachin Kadloor","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Sachin","lastName":"Kadloor","id":"37391854900"},{"name":"Raviraj Adve","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Raviraj","lastName":"Adve","id":"37269697500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4581-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"5235217","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":364},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Molecular communication","Transmitters","Electromagnetic propagation","Mathematical model","Mutual information","Absorption","Channel capacity","Decoding","Electron mobility","Probability distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biocommunications","Brownian motion","receivers","transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["molecular communication system","electromagnetic waves","information theoretic capacity","Brownian motion","probability density function"]}],"abstract":"Communication between a transmitter and a receiver using electromagnetic waves does not scale to nano-sizes.

In this work, we explore the affinity propagation (AP) message-passing technique to efficiently group nodes in an ad hoc cognitive radio network (CRN). With the proposed approach, nodes exchange local messages with their immediate neighbours until a high quality set of clusterheads and a corresponding cluster structure emerges. The messages are calculated based on measures of similarity between the network nodes, which are selected based on application requirements and the objective of the grouping process. As an initial application, we focus on finding a small dominating set of a CRN with the aim of reducing the number of nodes that participate in key network functions such as resource management and routing table maintenance. To demonstrate the merits of the proposed clustering approach, the AP technique is evaluated on randomly generated open spectrum access network scenarios. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique provides a smaller number of clusters than methods based on approximating a minimum size dominating set of the corresponding ad hoc network graphs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235219/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10869596","htmlLink":"/document/5235219/","conferenceDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Clustering of Cognitive Radio Networks Using Affinity Propagation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Clustering of Cognitive Radio Networks Using Affinity Propagation","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PID899672.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092132S","chronDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5235208","isNumber":"5235209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5235208","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5235209","articleId":"5235219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5235221,"authors":[{"name":"Mohsen Akbari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Akbari","id":"37589064900"},{"name":"Fabrice Labeau","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Fabrice","lastName":"Labeau","id":"37281330800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4581-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"5235221","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"abstract":"FIR Oversampled Filter banks (OFB) with degree zero polyphase matrices can be used as block codes over the field of real numbers. Since they can be regarded as real-valued codes, one can also use their potential advantage of joint source-channel coding and graceful degradation over noisy channels. Due to the variable state of noisy channels, increase in bit error probability is unavoidable hence increasing the injected redundancy of the input signal or decreasing the code rate is necessary. To decrease the code rate, the downsampling rate should be decreased as well as filter lengths to maintain the degree zero of the polyphase matrix. However, decreasing the filter lengths will deteriorate the performance of the OFB both in compression rate of the input signal and the amount of injected redundancy. This paper proposes the idea of adaptively changing the downsampling rate to modify the code rate without changing the filter length. This could be considered as some form of puncturing. We show that adaptive downsampling results in just changing the way input is fed into the OFB. Simulation results for quantized DFT codes with erasures show the efficiency of this method specially when the number of erasures is not very large.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filter bank","Quantization","Redundancy","Finite impulse response filter","Block codes","Image coding","Error correction codes","Robustness","Discrete Fourier transforms","Error probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","block codes","channel coding","discrete Fourier transforms","error correction codes","error statistics","FIR filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive downsampling","quantization noise","FIR oversampled filter banks","degree zero polyphase matrices","block codes","real-valued codes","joint source-channel coding","bit error probability","DFT codes"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2009.5235221","publicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of 18th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of 18th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5235208/5235209/05235221.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2009.5235221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Downsampling in Oversampled Filter Banks in the Presence of Quantization Noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5235221","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Downsampling in Oversampled Filter Banks in the Presence of Quantization Noise","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235221/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5235221/","accessionNumber":"10878484","conferenceDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Downsampling in Oversampled Filter Banks in the Presence of Quantization Noise","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PID899756.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059698S","chronDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5235208","isNumber":"5235209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5235208","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5235209","articleId":"5235221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5235251,"authors":[{"name":"Narayanan Krishnan","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Kansas State University, USA"],"firstName":"Narayanan","lastName":"Krishnan","id":"37085717730"},{"name":"Balasubramaniam Natarajan","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Kansas State University, USA"],"firstName":"Balasubramaniam","lastName":"Natarajan","id":"37278060200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4581-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"5235251","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":238},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5235251","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Decoding","MIMO","Relays","Circuits","Bit error rate","Error probability","Energy consumption","Collaboration","Power system relaying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficiency","decode-and- forward schemes","amplify-and-forward schemes","target symbol error probability","node cooperative network","minimum transmission energy","convex optimization problem","circuit energy","transmission energy","relay near source destination"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we quantify and compare the energy efficiency of amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and- forward (DF) schemes on a basic three node cooperative network. Total energy is calculated considering circuit energy as well as transmission energy. For AF and DF schemes, we set a target symbol error probability (SEP) and evaluate the minimum transmission energy for achieving the target SEP. In this process we first derive an approximation for SEP at high SNR for DF with possible error in relays. Next, we formulate energy calculation as a convex optimization problem and present the theoretical solution. The result is used to compare the total energy consumption of AF and DF for various relay positions: relay near source and relay near destination. The results illustrate significant dependence on (1) circuit energy for short distances where DF has lower energy efficiency and, (2) transmission energy at larger distances (between source and destination) where AF has lower efficiency.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2009.5235251","publicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of 18th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of 18th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5235208/5235209/05235251.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2009.5235251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficiency of Cooperative SIMO Schemes -Amplify Forward and Decode Forward","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficiency of Cooperative SIMO Schemes -Amplify Forward and Decode Forward","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5235251/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10878455","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235251/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficiency of Cooperative SIMO Schemes -Amplify Forward and Decode Forward","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PID898836.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049121S","chronDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5235208","isNumber":"5235209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5235208","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5235209","articleId":"5235251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5235260,"authors":[{"name":"Alan Kennedy","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Dublin, Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Kennedy","id":"37409794300"},{"name":"Zhen Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Dublin, Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Liu","id":"37289198100"},{"name":"Xiaojun Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Dublin, Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Xiaojun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293610900"},{"name":"Bin Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279241300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4581-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"5235260","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5235260","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Acceleration","Engines","Random access memory","Energy consumption","Classification tree analysis","Field programmable gate arrays","Throughput","Classification algorithms","Read-write memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer networks","decision trees","field programmable gate arrays","pattern classification","random-access storage","telecommunication network routing","tree data structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi engine packet classification hardware accelerator","router traffic","decision tree based packet classification algorithm","classification engine","tree traverser","leaf node searcher","ultrawide memory","FPGA","RAM","decision tree data structure"]}],"abstract":"As line rates increase, the task of designing high performance architectures with reduced power consumption for the processing of router traffic remains important. In this paper, we present a multi-engine packet classification hardware accelerator, which gives increased performance and reduced power consumption. It follows the basic idea of decision-tree based packet classification algorithms, such as HiCuts and HyperCuts, in which the hyperspace represented by the ruleset is recursively divided into smaller subspaces according to some heuristics. Each classification engine consists of a Trie Traverser which is responsible for finding the leaf node corresponding to the incoming packet, and a Leaf Node Searcher that reports the matching rule in the leaf node. The packet classification engine utilizes the possibility of ultra-wide memory word provided by FPGA block RAM to store the decision tree data structure, in an attempt to reduce the number of memory accesses needed for the classification. Since the clock rate of an individual engine cannot catch up to that of the internal memory, multiple classification engines are used to increase the throughput. The implementations in two different FPGAs show that this architecture can reach a searching speed of 169 million packets per second (mpps) with synthesized ACL, FW and IPC rulesets. Further analysis reveals that compared to state of the art TCAM solutions, a power savings of up to 72% and an increase in throughput of up to 27% can be achieved.","publicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of 18th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of 18th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5235208/5235209/05235260.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2009.5235260","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2009.5235260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Engine Packet Classification Hardware Accelerator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Engine Packet Classification Hardware Accelerator","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235260/","conferenceDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5235260/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10869532","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Engine Packet Classification Hardware Accelerator","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PID898901.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059642S","chronDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5235208","isNumber":"5235209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5235208","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5235209","articleId":"5235260","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5235261,"authors":[{"name":"Ayoub Alsarhan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Ayoub","lastName":"Alsarhan","id":"37397425500"},{"name":"Anjali Agarwal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Anjali","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37273300400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4581-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"5235261","dbTime":"43 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":325},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio spectrum management","Cognitive radio","Wireless mesh networks","IP networks","Web and internet services","Routing","Bandwidth","Frequency","Wireless networks","Information management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","Internet","telecommunication network management","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radios","wireless mesh network","cluster based spectrum management","Internet access","network access","packet forwarding","spectrum allocation","global management","clients mobility"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cluster-Based Spectrum Management Using Cognitive Radios in Wireless Mesh Network","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2009.5235261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235209","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of 18th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of 18th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5235208/5235209/05235261.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2009.5235261","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5235261","abstract":"Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) have emerged recently to extend Internet access and other networking services. WMNs routers provide network access to the clients and other networking functions such as routing, and packet forwarding. Bandwidth scarcity is the main challenge that limits the performance of WMNs. Although considerable research has been conducted on spectrum allocation, spectrum management is still considered an important open problem. This problem can be solved using cognitive radio technology that allows radios to intelligently locate free frequencies and use them efficiently. In this work, we propose a new spectrum management scheme that supports local and global management for a wireless network. Our scheme is based on clusters where the coordinator for each cluster manages spectrum information by keeping the required information at cluster level and for the whole network. Our scheme provides robust operation against any cluster head failure, as well as clients mobility.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235261/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10878487","htmlLink":"/document/5235261/","conferenceDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cluster-Based Spectrum Management Using Cognitive Radios in Wireless Mesh Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cluster-Based Spectrum Management Using Cognitive Radios in Wireless Mesh Network","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PID898910.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051202S","chronDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5235208","isNumber":"5235209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5235208","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5235209","articleId":"5235261","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5235262,"authors":[{"name":"Brian Quanz","affiliation":["Information and Telecommunication Technology Center, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Quanz","id":"37671704400"},{"name":"Hongliang Fei","affiliation":["Information and Telecommunication Technology Center, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Hongliang","lastName":"Fei","id":"37667852100"},{"name":"Jun Huan","affiliation":["Information and Telecommunication Technology Center, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Huan","id":"37666222800"},{"name":"Joseph Evans","affiliation":["Information and Telecommunication Technology Center, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Evans","id":"37286696500"},{"name":"Victor Frost","affiliation":["Information and Telecommunication Technology Center, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Frost","id":"37266088100"},{"name":"Gary Minden","affiliation":["Information and Telecommunication Technology Center, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Gary","lastName":"Minden","id":"37297038000"},{"name":"Daniel Deavours","affiliation":["Information and Telecommunication Technology Center, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Deavours","id":"37296579800"},{"name":"Leon Searl","affiliation":["Information and Telecommunication Technology Center, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Leon","lastName":"Searl","id":"37294163400"},{"name":"Daniel DePardo","affiliation":["Information and Telecommunication Technology Center, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"DePardo","id":"37294160900"},{"name":"Martin Kuehnhausen","affiliation":["Information and Telecommunication Technology Center, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Kuehnhausen","id":"37546002400"},{"name":"Daniel Fokum","affiliation":["Information and Telecommunication Technology Center, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Fokum","id":"37396038000"},{"name":"Matt Zeets","affiliation":["Information and Telecommunication Technology Center, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Matt","lastName":"Zeets","id":"37546003900"},{"name":"Angela Oguna","affiliation":["Information and Telecommunication Technology Center, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Angela","lastName":"Oguna","id":"37546003600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4581-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"5235262","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"abstract":"There has been increasing interest in incorporating sensing systems into objects or the environment for monitoring purposes.

The proposed framework is suitable for cognitive radios (CRs) as it allows the use of knowledge built from past experiences in the form of marginal densities as prior initializations in future calculations.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2009.5235274","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of 18th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5235208/5235209/05235274.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2009.5235274","publicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of 18th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian Wideband Spectrum Segmentation for Cognitive Radios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5235274","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian Wideband Spectrum Segmentation for Cognitive Radios","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235274/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5235274/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10869537","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","conferenceDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian Wideband Spectrum Segmentation for Cognitive Radios","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PID898747.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098328S","chronDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5235208","isNumber":"5235209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5235208","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5235209","articleId":"5235274","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5235280,"authors":[{"name":"Harkirat Singh","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Harkirat","lastName":"Singh","id":"37281490100"},{"name":"Su-Khiong Yong","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Su-Khiong","lastName":"Yong","id":"37574788900"},{"name":"Jisung Oh","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jisung","lastName":"Oh","id":"38184105800"},{"name":"Chiu Ngo","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chiu","lastName":"Ngo","id":"37287884600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4581-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"5235280","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1106},"abstract":"Interests in millimeter-wave resulted in the formation of Task Group 3c (TG3c) within IEEE 802.15 in 2005.

In comparison to the baseline 802.15.3 standard, the unique features of 802.15.3c are: 1) Directional transmissions; 2) Aggregation and Block Ack for supporting multi-Gbps MAC-SAP rate (up to 5.7 Gbps); 3) Unequal Error Protections for enabling uncompressed video streaming. In this paper, we present principles of the key features of the current draft D08 [1].

Moreover, they will also be exposed to diverse security threats especially at the physical layer (PHY) spectrum sensing module. Hence, security consideration is central in its development. Starting with overview of on-going research efforts in CR-based network security, this paper describes a PHY attacker model that exploits the adaptability and flexibility of CRN. In thwarting this attack, we propose a waveform pattern recognition scheme to identify emitters and detect camouflaging attackers by using the Electromagnetic Signature (EMS) of the transceiver. On the performance of the technique, our simulation results show that our approach is effective for spectrum monitoring, mitigating denial-of-service threats and facilitating spectral efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235288/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10869567","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","conferenceDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5235288/","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On Secure Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks Using Emitters Electromagnetic Signature","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Secure Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks Using Emitters Electromagnetic Signature","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PID898119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046702S","chronDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5235208","isNumber":"5235209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5235208","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5235209","articleId":"5235288","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5235301,"authors":[{"name":"Ramakant S.

In autonomous networks, nodes may act in their self- interest and improve their performance, perhaps at the expense of other nodes', or even the overall network's, performance. Besides, nodes must also contend with limited information about the network operating state during their decision-making. We analyze the above problem using non-cooperative game theory and quantify the impact of partial network state knowledge that nodes possess on the network optimality. We develop a local topology control algorithm that uses the idea of maintaining connectivity of 1-hop neighborhoods. This algorithm is first shown to converge and be stable. We then examine the trade-off between network performance (energy efficiency) and the cost of having knowledge (by exchanging control messages): more information exchange makes the nodes more network-aware, and hence leads to more efficient networks, but exchange of control information itself is costly. Taking the cost of obtaining knowledge into account, we observe that when nodes can operate along the continuum of knowledge, from 1-hop to omniscience, the network consumes least energy when nodes have significantly less connectivity information.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2009.5235301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2009.5235301","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of 18th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5235208/5235209/05235301.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of 18th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Selfishness, Local Information, and Network Optimality: A Topology Control Example","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"On Selfishness, Local Information, and Network Optimality: A Topology Control Example","conferenceDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5235301/","accessionNumber":"10869598","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235301/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Selfishness, Local Information, and Network Optimality: A Topology Control Example","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PID897670.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051045S","chronDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5235208","isNumber":"5235209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5235208","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5235209","articleId":"5235301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5235307,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen J.

A suboptimal importance density such as the prior can be used; but it has a problem of ignoring the current observations. In addition, like other Bayesian filtering techniques, particle filters require the knowledge about dynamic noise and measurement noise to approximate the posterior distribution. This paper presents a suboptimal particle filter that overcomes the problems of uncertain noise variance, and the drawback of the prior importance density. Computer simulation of a 2 times 2 MIMO system is presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed particle filter technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of MIMO Channel Using Suboptimal Particle Filtering","publicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of 18th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2009.5235323","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of 18th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5235208/5235209/05235323.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2009.5235323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235209","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5235323","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235323/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of MIMO Channel Using Suboptimal Particle Filtering","conferenceDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5235323/","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10869587","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of MIMO Channel Using Suboptimal Particle Filtering","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PID897004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054752S","chronDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5235208","isNumber":"5235209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5235208","xplore-issue":"5235209","articleId":"5235323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5235331,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Dinis","affiliation":["ISR-IST, Technology University of Lisbon, Portugal","FCT-Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Monte da Caparica, Portugal"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Dinis","id":"37269209500"},{"name":"Paulo Montezuma","affiliation":["UNINOVA, Monte da Caparica, Portugal","FCT-Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Monte da Caparica, Portugal"],"firstName":"Paulo","lastName":"Montezuma","id":"37348727400"},{"name":"Tiago Marques","affiliation":["FCT-Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Monte da Caparica, Portugal"],"firstName":"Tiago","lastName":"Marques","id":"37888380700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4581-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"5235331","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature phase shift keying","Interference cancellation","OFDM","Fluctuations","Power amplifiers","Continuous phase modulation","Degradation","Sampling methods","Costs","Batteries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","frequency-domain synthesis","quadrature phase shift keying","radio receivers","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SC-FDE","OQPSK","broadband wireless systems","frequency-domain receiver","I-Q interference","frequency-domain equalization","OQPSK-type schemes"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers frequency-domain receiver design for OQPSK-type schemes.

Though DSA shows great potential to enhance spectrum efficiency, the associated constraints on QoS may limit its usefulness. QoS support in a DSA-based network is not trivial due to the fact that in addition to unfavorable characteristics of the wireless medium, the secondary devices are subject to additional interference and interruption from incumbents. In this paper, we present a case-study of key QoS provisioning techniques in DSA protocol design that facilitate the required application QoS. Specifically, we consider a CR system that supports high quality multimedia (including HDTV) streaming over UHF frequency bands. We model and evaluate the QoS- oriented CR system together with the underlying QoS-Provisioned DSA Protocol (referred as QPDP) through extensive simulations. The results show the effectiveness of DSA coupled with QoS provisioning, in supporting QoS-demanding consumer- oriented network applications in TV bands. This outcome is significant as FCC has recently approved UHF bands for unlicensed operations in the second Report and Order in the USA, and various DSA-based personal/portable CR systems are being actively considered by the consumer wireless industry.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235338/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10878475","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","conferenceDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5235338/","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Case Study of QoS Provisioning in TV-Band Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Case Study of QoS Provisioning in TV-Band Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PID896178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050943S","chronDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5235208","isNumber":"5235209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5235208","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5235209","articleId":"5235338","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5235354,"authors":[{"name":"Kyungtae Kang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Kyungtae","lastName":"Kang","id":"37292233400"},{"name":"Dong Kun Noh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Dong Kun","lastName":"Noh","id":"37606210800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4581-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"5235354","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Timing","Algorithm design and analysis","Fading","Cryptography","Multicast algorithms","Multimedia communication","Communication system security","Digital multimedia broadcasting","Information analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcasting","code division multiple access","cryptography","fading channels","multicast communication","multimedia communication","Reed-Solomon codes","stochastic processes","telecommunication security","telecommunication services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic timing analysis","correlated fading channel","broadcast service","multicast service","CDMA2000 wireless telecommunications networks","content encryption","advance encryption standard block cipher algorithm","security layer","broadcast protocol suite","error control","Reed-Solomon coding","MAC layer","buffer size estimation","seamless multimedia services"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic Timing Analysis of the AES Cipher Algorithm over a Correlated Fading Channel","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2009.5235354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235209","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of 18th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of 18th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5235208/5235209/05235354.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2009.5235354","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5235354","abstract":"Broadcast and multicast services (BCMCS) in CDMA2000 wireless telecommunications networks restrict high- quality multimedia services to their intended recipients by encrypting content.

We surveyed the AES block cipher algorithm and characterized the time it requires. We also profiled the execution time of each transformation that comprises the AES cipher. Drawing on these results, we proposed a analytic model that can predict the time required to decrypt encrypted contents at a mobile by considering cross-layer information, such as the characteristics of error control using Reed-Solomon coding in the MAC layer and varying conditions of the fading channel in the physical layer.

The proposed algorithms converge to the same bit allocation as the optimal discrete bit-filling and bit-removal algorithms. The proposed algorithms can approach a near-optimal bit allocation with less computational steps by using a water-filling solution at the initial bit allocation step, and then a multiple-bit loading procedure to satisfy the target bit rate.

The schemes greatly reduce the number of reassignments and improve the dropping probability, at the expense of increased blocking. It is found that compared to detection by single users, detection by multiple users reduces the 'hidden node' problem. Using different minimum quality of service threshold percentages can partly control and improve the performance, in place of the more traditional SINR threshold levels. At the same time, with reinforcement leaning, the ability of find an optimal channel for users is significantly improved, because the channel weighting can help the users avoid the interference.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2009.5235371","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of 18th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5235208/5235209/05235371.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2009.5235371","publicationTitle":"2009 Proceedings of 18th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Radio with Reinforcement Learning Applied to Multicast Downlink Transmission and Distributed Occupancy Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5235371","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Radio with Reinforcement Learning Applied to Multicast Downlink Transmission and Distributed Occupancy Detection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235371/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5235371/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10878458","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","conferenceDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Radio with Reinforcement Learning Applied to Multicast Downlink Transmission and Distributed Occupancy Detection","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PID892740.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062912S","chronDate":"3-6 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5235208","isNumber":"5235209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5235208","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5235209","articleId":"5235371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5235684,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Sun","affiliation":["College of Information Sciences and Technology, Donghua Uinversity, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Sun","id":"37657540400"},{"name":"Yongsheng Ding","affiliation":["College of Information Sciences and Technology, Engineering Research Center of Digitized Textile &Fashion Technology, Ministry of Education, Donghua Uinversity, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yongsheng","lastName":"Ding","id":"37277996600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3676-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5235684","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manipulator dynamics","Genetic mutations","Cloning","Heuristic algorithms","Recurrent neural networks","Control systems","Educational technology","Textile technology","Concurrent computing","Nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["manipulator dynamics","nonlinear control systems","position control","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mutation coevolution clone algorithm","dynamic recurrent neural network","decoupling control","parallel manipulator","nonlinear system","coupling system","robot tracking control approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic Recurrent Neural Network","Mutation Co-evolution","Decoupling control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5235684","abstract":"Parallel manipulator is very complicate nonlinear, Strong coupling system.

In order to avoid aliasing due to fault transients, these relays employ an analog antialiasing filter before critical-sampling (Nyquist rate) the input waveforms coming from instrument transformers. In many applications of electrical engineering, oversampling (greater than the Nyquist rate) has long been used to simplify the requirements of an antialiasing filter with a sharp cutoff; in some cases, the filter can even be eliminated. This paper investigates this option for a digital relay. The performance of a traditional digital relay is compared with a method that uses oversampling without using an antialiasing filter. By processing a comprehensive array of fault waveforms from Electromagnetic Transients Program simulations, a suitable oversampling rate is suggested. A comparison of phasor estimates using the traditional relay and the proposed method is made for different operating and fault conditions. The results suggest that oversampling can eliminate the antialiasing filter traditionally employed in digital relays.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235740/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5235740/","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10880712","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Investigating the Option of Removing the Antialiasing Filter From Digital Relays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigating the Option of Removing the Antialiasing Filter From Digital Relays","sourcePdf":"24tpwrd04-sbrahma-2028802.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061266S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5235723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5235723","articleId":"5235740","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5235743,"authors":[{"name":"Morris Brenna","affiliation":["Department of Energy, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Morris Brenna (M'06) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, in 1999 and 2003, respectively.","Currently, he is an Assistant Professor with the Department of Energy, Politecnico di Milano.

Power quality (PQ) is a service and many customers are ready to pay for it. In the future, distribution system operators could decide, or could be obliged by authorities, to supply their customers with different PQ levels and at different prices. A new device that can fulfill this role is the OPEN unified power-quality conditioner (UPQC), composed of a power-electronic series steady-state performancemain unit installed in the medium-voltage/low-voltage (LV) substation, along with several power-electronic shunt units connected close to the end users. The series and parallel units do not have a common dc link, so their control strategies are different than traditional UPQC control techniques. This device can achieve general improvement in PQ, reducing the most common disturbances for all customers that are supplied by the mains (PQ) by using only the series unit. Additional increments in PQ (i.e., mains power interruptions), can be provided to the customers who need it (custom power) by the shunt units. Therefore, this new solution combines an improvement in PQ for all end users, with a cost reduction for those that need high quality power. The proposed solution has been analyzed and described, and a model of a 400-kVA LV grid is considered a test network to evaluate the steady-state performance and functioning limits. The results obtained under steady-state conditions justify the configuration chosen and good device performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5235723/05235743.pdf","startPage":"2107","endPage":"2116","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2028791","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2028791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235723","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5235743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Proposal for Power Quality and Custom Power Improvement: OPEN UPQC","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proposals","Power quality","Substations","Steady-state","Monitoring","Power system protection","Power system reliability","Power supplies","Medium voltage","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electricity supply industry","power grids","power supply quality","pricing","substations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power supply quality","custom power improvement","OPEN UPQC","unified power-quality conditioner","power-electronic series main unit","low-voltage substation","steady-state performance evaluation","power grid","pricing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active power conditioner","custom power","interface devices","OPEN unified power-quality conditioner (UPQC)","power quality (PQ)","unified power quality conditioner (UPQC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235743/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"A New Proposal for Power Quality and Custom Power Improvement: OPEN UPQC","volume":"24","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5235743/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10880681","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Proposal for Power Quality and Custom Power Improvement: OPEN UPQC","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-faranda-2028791.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06471S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5235723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"5235723","articleId":"5235743","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5235753,"authors":[{"name":"Abbas Saberi Noghabi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/5235723/5235753/5235753-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Abbas Saberi Noghabi was born in Gonabad, Iran, in 1977.

In practice, the system may be operated in different topologies due to outage of the transmission lines, transformers, and generating units. There are some situations for which the changes in the network topology of a system could cause the protective system to operate without selectivity. The aim of this paper is to study DOCRs coordination considering the effects of the different network topologies in the optimization problem. Corresponding to each network topology, a large number of coordination constraints should be taken into account in the problem formulation. In this situation, in addition to nonlinearity and nonconvexity, the optimization problem experiences many coordination constraints. The genetic algorithm (GA) is selected as a powerful tool in solving this complex and nonconvex optimization problem. In this paper, in order to improve the convergence of the GA, a new hybrid method is introduced. The results show a robust and optimal solution can be efficiently obtained by implementing the proposed hybrid GA method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235753/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","volume":"24","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10880686","htmlLink":"/document/5235753/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Considering Different Network Topologies in Optimal Overcurrent Relay Coordination Using a Hybrid GA","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Considering Different Network Topologies in Optimal Overcurrent Relay Coordination Using a Hybrid GA","sourcePdf":"24tpwrd04-jsadeh-2029057.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071571S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5235723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"210","xplore-issue":"5235723","articleId":"5235753","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5235756,"authors":[{"name":"Ujjwal Dahal Deep","affiliation":["Bhutan Power Corporation, Thimphu, Bhutan"],"bio":{"p":["Ujjwal Dahal Deep (S'06) received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, Canada, in 2008.","Currently, he is with Bhutan Power Corporation, Thimphu, Bhutan."]},"firstName":"Ujjwal Dahal","lastName":"Deep","id":"37888363800"},{"name":"Brent R.

With remote generation deployments, such as those based on wind energy, a cost-effective communication system with global coverage using satellite technology would be advantageous. The monitoring of remote generators for performance and maintenance issues is certainly necessary for any distributed-generation system. To offer a cost-effective satellite solution, a cost-optimization algorithm for minimizing data transmission while maximizing relevant telemetry data is required. This paper proposes a low-cost smart communications architecture using an Iridium Satellite System 9601 short-burst data transceiver and simple microcontroller technology. The microcontroller allows for simple optimization routines to be performed on the locally stored data.

Ultrasound and current leakage sensors, very-high frequency antenna, and thermovision instruments were employed to acquire signals and images in order to construct recognition systems. A number of specific features were applied to verify their importance during the classification process. Features were obtained in the time, frequency, and wavelet domains. Two groups of pattern-recognition techniques were applied: linear (Fisher and Karhunen-Loeve) and nonlinear (artificial neural network).

The presence of multipaths within the broadband power-line communication (BPLC) system, due to stochastic changes in the network load impedances, branches, etc. pose a real challenge as it affects network performance. This paper attempts to investigate the performance of an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based BPLC system that uses underground cables. It is found that when a branch is added in the link between the sending and receiving end, there is an average of 4-dB power loss. In addition, when the terminal impedances of the branches that are connected to the link between the transmitting and receiving end vary from line characteristic impedance to low-impedance values, the power loss (signal-to-noise ratio) is about 0.35 dB/ Omega. On the contrary, for an increase in the terminal impedances by 100 Omega above line characteristic impedance, the power loss is 0.23 dB//Omega. When the branch terminal impedances are close to short or open circuits, OFDM techniques show degraded performance. This situation is also observed when the number of branches increases. It is shown that to overcome degraded network performance, the concatenated Reed-Solomon codes/interleaved Viterbi methods can be used, which could be used for an efficient design of the BPLC system that uses OFDM techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Underground Cables That Use OFDM Systems for Broadband Power-Line Communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2031674","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5235723/05235761.pdf","startPage":"1889","endPage":"1897","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2031674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235723","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5235761","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235761/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Underground Cables That Use OFDM Systems for Broadband Power-Line Communications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5235761/","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10880673","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Underground Cables That Use OFDM Systems for Broadband Power-Line Communications","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-anatory-2031674.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082913S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5235723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5235723","articleId":"5235761","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5235762,"authors":[{"name":"H.

A specific approach of the generalized Benders decomposition algorithm is applied to solve the problem. The formulation can be embedded under two stages: the first one is the master problem and is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem. This stage determines the radial topology of the distribution network. The second stage is the slave problem and is formulated as a nonlinear programming problem. This stage is used to determine the feasibility of the Master problem solution by means of an OPF and provides information to formulate the linear Benders cuts that connect both problems. The model is programmed in the general algebraic modeling system. The effectiveness of the proposal is demonstrated through three examples extracted from the literature.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2027510","startPage":"2166","endPage":"2176","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5235723/05235762.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2027510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distribution Systems Reconfiguration Based on OPF Using Benders Decomposition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transformers","Power generation","Capacitors","Reactive power","Admittance","Load flow","Power system modeling","Load management","Substations","Distributed power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","integer programming","load flow","nonlinear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution network reconfiguration","OPF","optimal power flow","Benders decomposition approach","mixed integer nonlinear programming problem","radial network topology","general algebraic modeling system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Benders decomposition","distribution system","optimal power flow (OPF)","optimization","reconfiguration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235762/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Distribution Systems Reconfiguration Based on OPF Using Benders Decomposition","volume":"24","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5235762/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10880669","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distribution Systems Reconfiguration Based on OPF Using Benders Decomposition","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-khodr-2027510.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09511S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5235723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"5235723","articleId":"5235762","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5235770,"authors":[{"name":"Walid G.

Moreover, FFT is incapable of providing any time-related information which is a required property when dealing with time-evolving waveforms since it can provide only an amplitude-frequency spectrum. Since wavelet packet transform (WPT), which is a generalization of the wavelet transform, can represent EPS waveforms in a time-frequency domain, it is used in this study to define and formulate three-phase PQIs. In order to handle the unbalanced three-phase case, the concept of equivalent voltage and current is used to calculate those indices. The results of four numerical examples considering stationary and nonstationary, balanced and unbalanced three-phase systems in sinusoidal and nonsinusoidal situations indicate that the new WPT-based PQIs are closer to the true values. In addition, phase and overall crest factors are redefined in the time-frequency domain using WPT while a new crest factor is introduced in this paper. The redefined crest factors and the new crest factor help identifying and quantifying the waveform impact based on the time-frequency information obtained from the WPT. New crest factor can only be determined via WPT, which proves the powerful of this method and its suitability to define three-phase PQIs in nonstationary operating conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5235723/05235770.pdf","startPage":"2300","endPage":"2310","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2027496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2027496","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235723","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5235770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet Packet Transform-Based Power Quality Indices for Balanced and Unbalanced Three-Phase Systems Under Stationary or Nonstationary Operating Conditions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet packets","Power quality","Voltage","Wavelet transforms","Time frequency analysis","Wavelet domain","Flexible AC transmission systems","Uninterruptible power systems","Power system transients","Fast Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","power supply quality","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet packet transform","unbalanced three-phase system","balanced three-phase system","three-phase power-quality indices","electric power system waveform","fast Fourier transform","stationary waveform","nonstationary operating condition","spectral leakage phenomenon","sinusoidal operating condition","amplitude-frequency spectrum","time-frequency domain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nonstationary waveforms","power-quality (PQ) indices (PQIS)","three-phase systems","wavelet packet transform (WPT)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235770/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet Packet Transform-Based Power Quality Indices for Balanced and Unbalanced Three-Phase Systems Under Stationary or Nonstationary Operating Conditions","volume":"24","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5235770/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10880728","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet Packet Transform-Based Power Quality Indices for Balanced and Unbalanced Three-Phase Systems Under Stationary or Nonstationary Operating Conditions","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-morsi-2027496.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058232S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5235723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"5235723","articleId":"5235770","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5235775,"authors":[{"name":"Stuti Shukla","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/5235723/5235775/5235775-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stuti Shukla received the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from Uttar Pradesh (UP) Technical University, Lucknow, UP, India, in 2004, and the M.Eng. degree in power systems from Birla Institute of Technology, Ranchi, Jharkhand, India, in 2007.","She is currently a Research Scholar in the Electrical Engineering Department of the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, India.

The algorithm utilizes partial sum (PS)-based and multistage least-squares (MLS)-based methods before and after CT saturation is detected, respectively. The MLS-based method is initiated when the third difference of the secondary current detects the start point of the first saturation period. The determination of each saturation period is based on the sum of the secondary current from the start point of the first saturation period. A least-squares (LS) technique estimates the DC offset parameters from the single-cycle difference of the secondary current in the unsaturated periods. Removal of DC offset from the secondary current yields the sinusoidal waveform portion. Finally, the LS technique is used once again to estimate the phasor from the sinusoidal waveform portion. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated for a-g faults on a 345-kV 100-km overhead transmission line. The electromagnetic transient program was used to generate fault current signals for different fault angles and remanent fluxes. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed algorithm accurately estimates the phasor of a current signal regardless of DC offset and CT saturation. The paper concludes by describing the hardware implementation of the algorithm on a prototype unit based on a digital signal processor.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5235723/05235778.pdf","startPage":"1842","endPage":"1849","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2008.2002972","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2008.2002972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235723","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5235778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phasor Estimation in the Presence of DC Offset and CT Saturation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault currents","Circuit faults","Current transformers","Signal processing algorithms","Power transmission lines","EMTP","Signal generators","Hardware","Prototypes","Digital signal processors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current transformers","fault currents","least squares approximations","phase measurement","power overhead lines","power transmission faults"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CT saturation detection","current transformer","phasor estimation","DC offset","partial sum-based method","multistage least-squares-based methods","sinusoidal waveform portion","a-g faults","overhead transmission line","electromagnetic transient program","fault current signal generation","remanent flux","voltage 345 kV","distance 100 km"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Current transformer","dc offset","multistage least squares","saturation","partial sum","phasor estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235778/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Phasor Estimation in the Presence of DC Offset and CT Saturation","volume":"24","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5235778/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10880718","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phasor Estimation in the Presence of DC Offset and CT Saturation","sourcePdf":"23tpwrd04-snam-2002972.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095729S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5235723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"5235723","articleId":"5235778","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5235779,"authors":[{"name":"Surajit Midya","affiliation":["Rail Control Solutions, Bombardier Transportation, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/5235723/5235779/5235779-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Surajit Midya was born in India in 1976.

The asymmetry generates a net dc component and harmonics, which propagate within the traction power and signalling system and causes electromagnetic interference. Unlike DC-fed systems (Part I), the arcing in ac supply is complex because of the zero crossing of currents and voltages. In this paper, we discuss the mechanisms of sliding contact and arcing between pantograph-contact wire using the experimental setup described in Part I. Influences of various parameters and test conditions on arcing phenomenon and their signature patterns on the supply voltage and current waveforms are presented. It is shown how the arcing mechanism and corresponding asymmetry in the voltage and current waveforms are governed by line speed, current, supply voltage, inductive load, and pantograph material. The asymmetry in the current waveform is mainly due to the difference in the duration of successive zero-current regions and uneven distortion of the waveshapes. This, in turn, creates the asymmetry in the voltage waveform.

For instance, emerging ultrawideband (UWB) technology requires the use of a wide radio spectrum. However, the frequency spectrum as a resource is valuable and limited, so the spectrum is always being used for several purposes, which means it is full of unwanted signals when an operation such as a UWB wireless system is concerned. In this case, existing undesired narrowband radio signals, which vary from place to place and from time to time, may interfere with the UWB system's range. A solution for this is to introduce an electronically switchable or tunable narrow rejection band (notch) within the passband of a UWB bandpass filter. Such an electronically reconfigurable filter is also desired for wideband radar or electronic warfare systems. This paper discusses the development of electronically reconfigurable filter types.","doi":"10.1109/MMM.2009.933590","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/6668/5235781/05235820.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMM.2009.933590","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235781","startPage":"73","endPage":"83","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable planar filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5235820","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable planar filters","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235820/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10869256","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5235820/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable planar filters","sourcePdf":"38-10mmm06-hong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088504S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6668","isNumber":"5235781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6668","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"5235781","articleId":"5235820","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5235862,"authors":[{"name":"Eduardo Zambon","affiliation":["Department of Computing Science, Federal University of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Vitoria, Brazil"],"bio":{"p":["Eduardo Zambon received the B.S. degree in computing engineering and the M.S. degree in computing science from the Federal University of Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2014UFES, Vit\u00f3ria, ES, Brazil, in 2003 and 2006, respectively."]},"firstName":"Eduardo","lastName":"Zambon","id":"37886904500"},{"name":"D\u00c9bora Z.

Any change in the load affects the dc-link voltage directly. The sudden removal of load would result in an increase in the dc-link voltage above the reference value, whereas a sudden increase in load would reduce the dc-link voltage below its reference value. The proper operation of DSTATCOM requires variation of the dc-link voltage within the prescribed limits. Conventionally, a proportional-integral (PI) controller is used to maintain the dc-link voltage to the reference value. It uses deviation of the capacitor voltage from its reference value as its input. However, the transient response of the conventional PI dc-link voltage controller is slow. In this paper, a fast-acting dc-link voltage controller based on the energy of a dc-link capacitor is proposed. Mathematical equations are given to compute the gains of the conventional controller based on fast-acting dc-link voltage controllers to achieve similar fast transient response. The detailed simulation and experimental studies are carried out to validate the proposed controller.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2027501","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5235723/05235863.pdf","startPage":"2291","endPage":"2299","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2027501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast-Acting DC-Link Voltage Controller for Three-Phase DSTATCOM to Compensate AC and DC Loads","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235863/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Fast-Acting DC-Link Voltage Controller for Three-Phase DSTATCOM to Compensate AC and DC Loads","volume":"24","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10880697","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5235863/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast-Acting DC-Link Voltage Controller for Three-Phase DSTATCOM to Compensate AC and DC Loads","sourcePdf":"24tpwrd04-mmishra-2027501.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091301S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5235723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"5235723","articleId":"5235863","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":5235868,"authors":[{"name":"Ronny Sternberger","affiliation":["Engineering Department, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Ronny Sternberger (S'06) received the Dipl.-Ing.(FH) degree in electrical energy engineering from the Fachhochschule f\u00fcr Technik und Wirtschaft, Berlin, Berlin, Germany, in 2004 and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree at the University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, U.K.","His current research interests are flexible ac transmission devices, multilevel converters, and control systems."]},"firstName":"Ronny","lastName":"Sternberger","id":"37846416900"},{"name":"Dragan Jovcic","affiliation":["Engineering Department, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Dragan Jovcic (S'97\u2013M'00\u2013SM'06) received the D.Eng. degree in control engineering from the University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in 1993 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand, in 1999.","Currently, he is a Lecturer with the University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, U.K., where he has been since 2004.

Each voltage component is analyzed in detail and described mathematically by an averaged expression with an equivalent capacitance. The STATCOM model is linearized and linked with a DQ frame AC system model and the controller model, and implemented in MATLAB. The controller gains are selected by analyzing the root locus of the analytical model to give optimum responses. The validity and accuracy of the proposed model are verified against non-linear digital simulation PSCAD/EMTDC in the time and frequency domain. The model is very accurate in the subsynchronous range, and it is adequate for most control design applications and practical stability issues below 100 Hz.

The converter can find potential application in connecting high-power dc sources, interfacing to high-voltage dc transmission or to flexible ac transmission system elements. The converter is based on two resonant circuits which share a common ac capacitor. The topology is simple and utilizes thyristors with potentially all soft switchings. Complete analytical modelling is presented which enables systematic design procedure for the converter. The detailed digital simulation on PSCAD platform confirms satisfactory operation on a 5-MW test system, which connects 4-kV dc source to an 80-kV high voltage dc grid. The converter shows good responses to rapid changes in power magnitude/direction and it is concluded that robustness to terminal voltage disturbances is excellent. Since the highest-power phase-control thyristors are employed, the converter can potentially be used at much higher power levels. The passive components are of reasonable size.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5235723/05235872.pdf","startPage":"2276","endPage":"2283","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2028600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2028600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235723","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5235872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bidirectional, High-Power DC Transformer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thyristors","Voltage","DC-DC power converters","Analog-digital conversion","Joining processes","Flexible AC transmission systems","RLC circuits","Switched capacitor circuits","Circuit topology","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","thyristors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-power DC transformer","dc-dc converter","thyristor converters","resonant circuits"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC\u2013DC power conversion","high-voltage dc transmission","thyristor converters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235872/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Bidirectional, High-Power DC Transformer","volume":"24","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5235872/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10880658","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bidirectional, High-Power DC Transformer","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-jovcic-2028600.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053912S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5235723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"5235723","articleId":"5235872","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5235905,"authors":[{"name":"Jose Antonio Medina Hernandez","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, CINVESTAV, Mexico, Mexico","Electrical Engineering Department, Av.

Due to the increasing popularity of FPGAs, some schemes have specifically been developed for testing memories in these devices. FPGAs, when used in airborne space applications, are exposed to radiations which can produce faults within their memory. Faults may also develop during the manufacturing process. In the past, testing embedded memories within Field Programmable Gate Arrays has been limited to the detection of stuck-at faults. Recent studies have shown that FPGA memories are also prone to address decoder, transient, and inversion coupling faults. To address these faults, the current research proposes to develop a Built-in Self Test (BIST) technique for testing embedded SRAM memories of Virtex-4 FPGAs for the presence of address decoder, inverse coupling, transient and also stuck-at faults. The technique is modeled using VHDL. Simulation results are presented to verify fault detection.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2009.5235927","publicationTitle":"2009 52nd IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 52nd IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230480/5235877/05235927.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2009.5235927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235877","startPage":"965","endPage":"970","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Testing faults in SRAM memory of Virtex-4 FPGA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5235927","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Testing faults in SRAM memory of Virtex-4 FPGA","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235927/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10868560","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5235927/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Testing faults in SRAM memory of Virtex-4 FPGA","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"REC001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062544S","chronDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230480","isNumber":"5235877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230480","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5235877","articleId":"5235927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5235930,"authors":[{"name":"Babak Ansari","affiliation":["Islamic Azad University, Iran"],"firstName":"Babak","lastName":"Ansari","id":"37580287400"},{"name":"Hossein Shamsi","affiliation":["K.N.

To match multiple regular expression patterns simultaneously, compiling multiple regular expressions into a composite DFA is an intuitive and efficient way. However, traditional memory architecture suffers from the problem of memory explosion for certain complex regular expressions. In this paper, we propose a hybrid memory architecture which inserts marginal logic elements to improve the ability of traditional memory architecture to deal with complex regular expressions. The experimental results demonstrate a significant memory reduction for complex regular expressions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid memory architecture for regular expression matching","publicationTitle":"2009 52nd IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2009.5235940","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 52nd IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230480/5235877/05235940.pdf","startPage":"1159","endPage":"1162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2009.5235940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235877","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5235940","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235940/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid memory architecture for regular expression matching","conferenceDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5235940/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10868573","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid memory architecture for regular expression matching","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SOC016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060478S","chronDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230480","isNumber":"5235877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230480","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5235877","articleId":"5235940","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5235952,"authors":[{"name":"Yuen Sum Ng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yuen Sum","lastName":"Ng","id":"37410669800"},{"name":"Lincoln Lai Kan Leung","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Lincoln Lai Kan","lastName":"Leung","id":"37401701200"},{"name":"Ka Nang Leung","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Ka Nang","lastName":"Leung","id":"37269821400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4479-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4480-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1548-3746"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3899"}],"articleNumber":"5235952","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":926},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Impedance matching","Wireless LAN","WiMAX","Network topology","Circuit topology","Inductors","Resonance","Driver circuits","CMOS process"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","driver circuits","microwave integrated circuits","microwave power amplifiers","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fully-integrated CMOS Class-AB power amplifier","two-stage cascode topology","load-pull output matching networks","driver resonant tank","circuit fabrication","power-added efficiency","IEEE 802.11a","IEEE 802.16e","OFDM signals","error vector magnitudes","WLAN standards","WiMAX standards","frequency 3 GHz","size 0.18 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","Class-AB","Power Amplifiers","Load Pull","Output Matching Network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5235952","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2009.5235952","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2009.5235952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235877","publicationTitle":"2009 52nd IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 52nd IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230480/5235877/05235952.pdf","startPage":"995","endPage":"998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 3-GHz fully-integrated CMOS Class-AB power amplifier","abstract":"A 3-GHz CMOS Class-AB power amplifier (PA) is presented in this paper.

Combining the threshold and edge detection templates, a procedure to obtain edges on gray level images was implemented.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2009.5235993","startPage":"730","endPage":"733","publicationTitle":"2009 52nd IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2009.5235993","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235877","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 52nd IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230480/5235877/05235993.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A method for edge detection in gray level images, based on cellular neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5235993/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A method for edge detection in gray level images, based on cellular neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5235993/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10868632","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","conferenceDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method for edge detection in gray level images, based on cellular neural networks","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"IMA012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076026S","chronDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230480","isNumber":"5235877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230480","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5235877","articleId":"5235993","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5236005,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Lin","id":"37402312700"},{"name":"Yong-Bin Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Yong-Bin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280930000"},{"name":"Fabrizio Lombardi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Lombardi","id":"37279999000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4479-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4480-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1548-3746"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3899"}],"articleNumber":"5236005","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":226},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitance","CMOS technology","Latches","Computer errors","Delay","Circuit simulation","CMOS memory circuits","Voltage","Nanotechnology","Circuit synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","integrated circuit design","nanoelectronics","radiation hardening (electronics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft error hardening","nanoscale CMOS memory design","data storage","HSPICE simulation","power delay product","size 32 nm"]}],"abstract":"Tolerance to soft errors has become a strict requirement in today's nanoscale CMOS designs. This paper proposes a new hardening design technique for CMOS memory cell at 32nm feature size. The proposed hardened memory cell overcomes the problems associated with the previous designs by utilizing novel access and refreshing mechanisms. Simulation shows that the data stored in the proposed hardened memory cell does not change even for a transient pulse with more than two times higher charge than the conventional memory cell and achieves a 55% reduction in power delay product compared to the DICE cell, thus achieving a significant improvement in soft error tolerance. The extensive HSPICE simulations show that the proposed memory cell is preferable over existing configurations when designing hardened memories for both high performance and soft error tolerance.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2009.5236005","publicationTitle":"2009 52nd IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 52nd IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230480/5235877/05236005.pdf","startPage":"679","endPage":"682","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2009.5236005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel design technique for soft error hardening of Nanoscale CMOS memory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5236005","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5236005/","displayDocTitle":"A novel design technique for soft error hardening of Nanoscale CMOS memory","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10868644","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5236005/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel design technique for soft error hardening of Nanoscale CMOS memory","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"EMB001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05002S","chronDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230480","isNumber":"5235877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230480","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5235877","articleId":"5236005","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5236008,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37530896200"},{"name":"Erdal Oruklu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Erdal","lastName":"Oruklu","id":"37300225600"},{"name":"Jafar Saniie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Jafar","lastName":"Saniie","id":"37300151000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4479-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4480-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1548-3746"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3899"}],"articleNumber":"5236008","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fast Fourier transforms","Video compression","Pixel","Video sequences","Streaming media","Degradation","Decoding","Image quality","Video coding","Redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","fast Fourier transforms","low-power electronics","microprocessor chips","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power memory addressing scheme","fast fourier transform processor","optimization scheme","dynamic power reduction","multibank memory structure","radix-2 FFT kernel","size 0.18 mum"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new memory addressing architecture is proposed for low-power radix-2 FFT implementations.

Widely available commercial FPGAs are based on lookup tables (LUTs) consisting of SRAM arrays and multiplexers. In this paper, we analyze the leakage power dissipation in the SRAM-array of a FPGA LUT for a 65 nm CMOS process. We apply power-gating to an FPGA LUT SRAM array in two different ways, namely, coarse-grain power gating and fine-grain power gating. We carry out a comparative analysis of the two methods. In our research, we found that power-gating can be employed to drastically reduce the leakage power dissipation in the SRAM. More leakage savings were obtained with coarse-grain power-gating than with fine-grain power gating. The coarse-grain and fine-grain power-gating techniques yielded approximately 99 percent and 81 percent leakage savings, respectively, over the case where no power-gating is applied.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Table lookup","Power dissipation","Random access memory","Threshold voltage","CMOS technology","Tunneling","Leakage current","Multiplexing","CMOS process"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS digital integrated circuits","field programmable gate arrays","SRAM chips","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fine-grain power gating","coarse-grain power gating","FPGA lookup tables","leakage power dissipation","field-programmable gate arrays","SRAM arrays","multiplexers","CMOS process","size 65 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coarse-grain power-gating","fine-grain power-gating","Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)","leakage","low-power"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5236045","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2009.5236045","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 52nd IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230480/5235877/05236045.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2009.5236045","startPage":"507","endPage":"510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235877","publicationTitle":"2009 52nd IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparative analysis of coarse-grain and fine-grain power gating for FPGA lookup tables","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A comparative analysis of coarse-grain and fine-grain power gating for FPGA lookup tables","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5236045/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","conferenceDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5236045/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10868684","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparative analysis of coarse-grain and fine-grain power gating for FPGA lookup tables","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"DIG021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063549S","chronDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230480","isNumber":"5235877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230480","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5235877","articleId":"5236045","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5236054,"authors":[{"name":"Mahta Haghi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Mahta","lastName":"Haghi","id":"37543392600"},{"name":"Jeff Draper","affiliation":["Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern California, Marina Del Rey, USA"],"firstName":"Jeff","lastName":"Draper","id":"37266688700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4479-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4480-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1548-3746"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3899"}],"articleNumber":"5236054","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":435},"abstract":"In this paper, we introduce the double-DICE storage element, which reduces charge sharing and collecting between the sensitive nodes of sensitive pairs in a dual interlocked cell (DICE) storage cell in 90 nm technology.

An area savings of 33.3 % results as compared to the case where no interleaving is used with the same nodal separation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 52nd IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230480/5235877/05236054.pdf","startPage":"463","endPage":"466","publicationTitle":"2009 52nd IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2009.5236054","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2009.5236054","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235877","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5236054","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The 90 nm Double-DICE storage element to reduce Single-Event upsets","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interleaved codes","Single event upset","Ionizing radiation","MOS devices","Space technology","Libraries","Semiconductor devices","Capacitance","Logic devices","Protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["storage management chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["double-DICE storage element","single-event upsets","dual interlocked cell storage cell","sensitive nodes","charge collecting","single-event strike","size 90 nm","size 8.5 mum","size 5 mum"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5236054/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"The 90 nm Double-DICE storage element to reduce Single-Event upsets","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5236054/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10868747","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","conferenceDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The 90 nm Double-DICE storage element to reduce Single-Event upsets","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"DIG009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108246S","chronDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230480","isNumber":"5235877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230480","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5235877","articleId":"5236054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5236055,"authors":[{"name":"Zdenek Kolka","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Communications, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Zdenek","lastName":"Kolka","id":"37546869900"},{"name":"Michal Kubicek","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Communications, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Michal","lastName":"Kubicek","id":"37887575400"},{"name":"Dalibor Biolek","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Communications, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Dalibor","lastName":"Biolek","id":"37332028300"},{"name":"Viera Biolkova","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Communications, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Viera","lastName":"Biolkova","id":"37332024000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4479-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4480-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1548-3746"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3899"}],"articleNumber":"5236055","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":437},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Space technology","Design optimization","Clocks","Prototypes","Testing","Application specific integrated circuits","Ultraviolet sources","Fading","Jitter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","fading channels","field programmable gate arrays","optical links","sampling methods","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["oversampling data recovery optimization","blind oversampling clock and data recovery","FPGA prototyping","digital architecture","FPGA-based testing","ASIC technology","free space optical","frequently fading channel","statistical simulation model","CDR optimization","decision algorithm","jitter tolerance","Xilinx FPGA platform"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5236055","abstract":"The paper deals with the design and optimization of blind oversampling clock and data recovery (CDR) based on FPGA prototyping. The main advantage of the oversampling CDR is the fully digital architecture, which enables the FPGA-based testing and its subsequent integration into any ASIC technology. The oversampling CDR is a promising block for free space optical (FSO) applications because of its extremely short reacquisition time, which is the key feature for efficient communication over the frequently fading channel. An efficient statistical simulation model for the CDR optimization is presented. Our effort in optimization was focused mainly on the simplification of the decision algorithm while maintaining acceptable jitter tolerance.

Multiple-valued logic (MVL) circuits have attracted substantial interest due to the capability of increasing information content per unit area. In the past extensive design techniques for MVL circuits (especially ternary logic inverters) have been proposed for implementation in CMOS technology. In CNTFET device, the threshold voltage of the transistor can be controlled by controlling the chirality vector (i.e. the diameter); in this paper this feature is exploited to design ternary logic inverters. New designs are proposed and compared with existing CNTFET-based designs. Extensive simulation results using SPICE demonstrate that power delay product is improved by 300% comparing to the conventional ternary gate design.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2009.5236063","publicationTitle":"2009 52nd IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 52nd IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230480/5235877/05236063.pdf","startPage":"435","endPage":"438","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2009.5236063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel CNTFET-based ternary logic gate design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5236063","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5236063/","displayDocTitle":"A novel CNTFET-based ternary logic gate design","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10868756","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5236063/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel CNTFET-based ternary logic gate design","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"DIG002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053279S","chronDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230480","isNumber":"5235877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230480","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"5235877","articleId":"5236063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5236066,"authors":[{"name":"Danijel Maricic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Danijel","lastName":"Maricic","id":"37887608500"},{"name":"Zeljko Ignjatovic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Zeljko","lastName":"Ignjatovic","id":"37270103900"},{"name":"Mark F.

This architecture is a relatively simple and robust design where the only analog components required outside of the pixel array are shared row comparators and a voltage mode digital-to-analog converter (DAC) to supply the in-pixel charge feedback structures. The photodiode acts as the integrator of the SigmaDelta modulator and an in-pixel charge feedback DAC is realized with two PMOS transistors. A third, minimum size PMOS transistor operating in the cut-off region provides capacitive coupling through which a controlled amount of charge is injected to the photodiode. The sensitivity of the image sensor is determined by the size of the feedback charge packets in the SigmaDelta modulator. The remainder of the image sensor is all digital, including a decimation filter to convert each pixel's single bit output stream into a multi-bit sample.

Sphere decoding using depth first search has less average complexity than K-best tree search, but the complexity varies greatly among different symbols, thus creating problems for systems implementation requiring constant throughput. In this work, we propose a hybrid algorithm that uses both sphere decoding and K-best tree search to provide better performance with invariable throughput. The corresponding re-configurable architecture is also designed to implement the hybrid algorithm. From the experimental results, it is shown that a 25% enhancement in throughput is obtained compared with the previous block-based fixed throughput SD detector.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2009.5236095","publicationTitle":"2009 52nd IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 52nd IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230480/5235877/05236095.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2009.5236095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235877","startPage":"297","endPage":"300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid algorithm and its re-configurable architecture for MIMO detector","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5236095","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid algorithm and its re-configurable architecture for MIMO detector","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5236095/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10868788","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5236095/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid algorithm and its re-configurable architecture for MIMO detector","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"COM018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05203S","chronDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230480","isNumber":"5235877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230480","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5235877","articleId":"5236095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5236098,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Blocher","affiliation":["Christian Doppler Laboratory of Nonlinear Signal Processing, Graz University of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Blocher","id":"37903023500"},{"name":"Peter Singerl","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies Austria AG, Austria"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Singerl","id":"37422196700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4479-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4480-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1548-3746"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3899"}],"articleNumber":"5236098","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":342},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Transmitters","Power amplifiers","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Baseband","Pulse width modulation","Signal processing","Signal generators","Band pass filters","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","power amplifiers","pulse width modulation","radio transmitters","radiofrequency amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM coding efficiency","switched-mode RF transmitter architecture","complex modulated signals","switched-mode power amplifier","baseband signal processing","bandpass filter","transmit antenna"]}],"abstract":"Conventional RF transmitters with power amplifiers in e.g. Class-AB operation provide only moderate electrical efficiencies for complex modulated signals. To increase the overall efficiency considerably, we can employ switched-mode power amplifiers (SMPA) with an appropriate baseband signal processing. Such efficient SMPAs generate a lot of spectral out-of-band components, which has to be attenuated by a bandpass filter before the signal is fed to the transmit antenna. Unfortunately, this impacts the electrical efficiency because these unwanted signal components are usually dissipated within the transmitter. A measure for the electrical efficiency degradation for complex modulated signals in a switched-mode operation is the coding efficiency. In this paper we develop different switched-mode transmitter architectures based on baseband PWM coding and analyze the coding efficiencies for different signal statistics.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2009.5236098","publicationTitle":"2009 52nd IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 52nd IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230480/5235877/05236098.pdf","startPage":"276","endPage":"279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2009.5236098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coding efficiency for different switched-mode RF transmitter architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5236098","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5236098/","displayDocTitle":"Coding efficiency for different switched-mode RF transmitter architectures","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10868791","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5236098/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding efficiency for different switched-mode RF transmitter architectures","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"COM013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054882S","chronDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230480","isNumber":"5235877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230480","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5235877","articleId":"5236098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5236109,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Wan","affiliation":["Centre of Signal Processing and Communications, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Wan","id":"37305860300"},{"name":"Wei-Ping Zhu","affiliation":["Centre of Signal Processing and Communications, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Wei-Ping","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37275886700"},{"name":"M.N.S.

This analysis is a valuable study since the ideal WR-based method provides the upper bound of the channel estimation performance for WR-based methods. First, the expression of the error of the rotation matrix is derived by using a perturbation analysis. This result is then utilized to derive a closed-form expression of mean square error (MSE) of the ideal WR-based method.

Making matters worse, the inherent gain available from the nano-CMOS transistors is dropping. Traditional techniques for achieving high-gain by vertically stacking (i.e. cascoding) transistors becomes less useful in nano-scale CMOS processes. Horizontal cascading (multi-stage) must be used in order to realize high-gain op-amps in low supply voltage processes. This paper discusses new design techniques for the realization of three-stage op-amps. The proposed and experimentally verified op-amps, fabricated in 500 nm CMOS, typically exhibit 30 MHz unity-gain frequency, near 100 ns transient settling and 72deg phase-margin for 500 pF load. This results in significantly higher op-amp performance metrics over the traditional op-amp designs while at the same time having smaller layout area.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5236164/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5236164/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10868735","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Indirect compensation techniques for three-stage CMOS op-amps","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Indirect compensation techniques for three-stage CMOS op-amps","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"AMP03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045213S","chronDate":"2-5 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230480","isNumber":"5235877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230480","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5235877","articleId":"5236164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5236165,"authors":[{"name":"Vaibhav Kumar","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Vaibhav","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37089063642"},{"name":"Degang Chen","affiliation":["Iowa State University, USA"],"firstName":"Degang","lastName":"Chen","id":"38182879900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4479-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4480-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1548-3746"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3899"}],"articleNumber":"5236165","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":427},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5236165","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Operational amplifiers","Frequency","Capacitors","Voltage","Poles and zeros","Impedance","Output feedback","Topology","Transfer functions","Fabrication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback amplifiers","network synthesis","network topology","operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["operational amplifier","indirect feedback compensation","design strategy","multistage op-amp topology"]}],"abstract":"A design procedure for an operational amplifier using indirect compensation is presented in this paper.

In this paper, by analyzing image stabilization principles and commonly used algorithms, a new algorithm which combined gray-scale projection with block-matching algorithm is proposed. The algorithm uses gray-scale projection algorithm to perform the first matching and rough compensation, in which a new scheme of searching called splite half search (SHS) and other methods are used to decrease computation. Here, gray-scale projection plays a role of making assistance for the next steps. Then it uses block-matching algorithm for the second matching and precise compensation, which diamond search (DS) algorithm is employed for greatly improving efficiency. Therefore the algorithm is a coarse-to-fine process for image stabilization. The combination of gray-scale projection and block matching algorithm can work very well. Experimental results show that the new algorithm well preserves high stabilization accuracy, at a dramatic reduction of computational complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on IT in Medicine & Education","pdfPath":"/iel5/5233394/5236201/05236293.pdf","startPage":"1262","endPage":"1266","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on IT in Medicine & Education","doi":"10.1109/ITIME.2009.5236293","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITIME.2009.5236293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5236201","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5236293","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image stabilization by combining gray-scale projection and block matching algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gray-scale","Motion estimation","Projection algorithms","Jitter","Motion compensation","Frequency selective surfaces","Video sequences","Information science","Image analysis","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image matching","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image stabilization principle","gray-scale projection algorithm","block matching algorithm","rough compensation","splite half search","diamond search algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5236293/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Image stabilization by combining gray-scale projection and block matching algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5236293/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10868890","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image stabilization by combining gray-scale projection and block matching algorithm","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"9015gp.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042042S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5233394","isNumber":"5236201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5233394","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5236201","articleId":"5236293","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5236386,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Xu","id":"37592381000"},{"name":"Meina Song","affiliation":["School of Computer, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Meina","lastName":"Song","id":"37278155400"},{"name":"Xiaoqi Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoqi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405029200"},{"name":"Junde Song","affiliation":["School of Computer, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Junde","lastName":"Song","id":"37277429900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3928-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3930-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5236386","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":1320},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5236386","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Computer architecture","File systems","Memory","Telecommunication computing","Large-scale systems","Neck","Prototypes","Scalability","Network servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["peer-to-peer computing","storage management","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing platform","P2P","e-business","e-education","scalable large-scale data server cluster","data storage service","master server"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","P2P","storage"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ITIME.2009.5236386","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on IT in Medicine & Education","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on IT in Medicine & Education","pdfPath":"/iel5/5233394/5236201/05236386.pdf","startPage":"427","endPage":"432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITIME.2009.5236386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5236201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cloud Computing Platform Based on P2P","abstract":"In recent years, the technology of cloud computing has been widely applied in e-business, e-education and etc..

Moreover, in many applications, the analyte concentration is very low. In particular, the in situ detection of neurotransmitter release from neurons is challenging due to the limited number of molecules secreted and their fast diffusion and reuptake immediately after release. In this paper, we present a method that allows for the local amplification of L-glutamate directly on the chip surface. Our approach is based on the surface patterning of a bienzymatic system consisting of glutamate oxidase (GLOD) and glutamic-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) that amplifies L-glutamate via a recycling process. The surface chemistry was optimized for maximal enzyme loading. The level of amplification was determined using a colorimetric assay. Coimmobilization of GLOD and GPT yielded at least a doubling of the signal, and increasing the surface concentrations of each enzyme led to amplification levels that approached those obtained in solution. We show that these enzymes can be patterned on substrates using a flip chip bonder for aligned microcontact printing. Furthermore, primary mouse hippocampal neurons were successfully cultured on these patterned surfaces and remained viable for at least five days. The enzymatic pattern was preserved on the substrate surface for the same time period. Lastly, amplification of L-glutamate released from neurons seven days in vitro was detected. Thus, we conclude that this bienzymatic system can ultimately be applied to biosensor surfaces for the in vitro detection of L-glutamate.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2009.2032237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2009.2032237","startPage":"102","endPage":"110","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/7729/5705639/05238509.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5705639","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Surface Amplification of L-Glutamate Using a Patterned Bienzymatic System for Biosensing Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Surface Amplification of L-Glutamate Using a Patterned Bienzymatic System for Biosensing Applications","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2011","volume":"10","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5238509/","accessionNumber":"11804331","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5238509/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Surface Amplification of L-Glutamate Using a Patterned Bienzymatic System for Biosensing Applications","sourcePdf":"tnano-rand-2032237-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098214S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"5705639","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5705639","articleId":"5238509","onlineDate":"15 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5238511,"authors":[{"name":"Wansuree Massagram","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hawaii, Manoa, Honolulu, HI, USA","Faculty of Science, Department of Computer Science and Information Technology, Naresuan University, Phitsanulok, Thailand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5280560/5238511/5238511-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wansuree Massagram received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, in 2001 and 2002, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Hawaii at Manoa, in 2008.","In October 2008, she joined the Department of Computer Science and Information Technology, Naresuan University, Phitsanulok, Thailand.","Dr. Massagram was the recipient of the First Place Prize of the IBM Information Technology and Service Solution Competition at the Undergraduate Research Symposium in 2001.

Three-dimensional models of man-made objects are illuminated by a virtual SAR sensor whose signal is approximated by rays sent through the model space. To this end, open-source software tools are adapted and extended to derive output data in SAR geometry followed by creating the reflectivity map. Rays can be followed for multiple reflections within the object scene. Signals having different multiple reflection levels are stored in separate image layers. For evaluating the potentials and limits of the simulation approach, simulated reflectivity maps and distribution maps are compared with real TerraSAR-X images for various complex man-made objects like a skyscraper in Tokyo, the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas, and the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The results show that the simulation can provide very valuable information to interpret complex SAR images or to predict the reflectivity of planned SAR image acquisitions.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2029339","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5416603/05238514.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2029339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416603","startPage":"1445","endPage":"1456","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ray-Tracing Simulation Techniques for Understanding High-Resolution SAR Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5238514","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ray-Tracing Simulation Techniques for Understanding High-Resolution SAR Images","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5238514/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"48","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11138137","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5238514/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ray-Tracing Simulation Techniques for Understanding High-Resolution SAR Images","sourcePdf":"tgrs-auer-2029339.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094393S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5416603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"5416603","articleId":"5238514","onlineDate":"15 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5238533,"authors":[{"name":"John J.

Mobile mining machinery, located in the miner's peripheral field of view ( plusmn10deg to about plusmn60deg off-axis), may pose potential pinning and striking hazards. The main objective of this research was to determine if there were peripheral visual performance improvements for the detection of moving objects when using cool-white light-emitting diode (LED) cap lamps as compared to incandescent (INC) light bulbs commonly used in miner cap lamps. The cap lamp variable of interest is the spectral power distribution. The illuminances were normalized by a diffusion filter. The second objective was to determine if age is a factor for the peripheral visual performance. This is important because the workforce is aging-the average miner age is about 43 years old. Thirty subjects participated in the study, ten subjects each in the age groups of younger (18-25 years), middle (40-50 years), and older (51+ years). Visual performance was quantified by the subjects' speed and accuracy of response to detect the rotation of high-contrast (white) circular targets located 3.83 m away at -20deg, 40deg, and 50deg off-axis. The speed of detection and the number of missed target rotations (accuracy) were measured. The prototype LED cap lamp results were best with an 11%-15% improvement compared to the INC and LED cap lamps, respectively. Age does appear to be a significant factor. For the middle and older age groups, the target movement detection time increased 75% and 60%, and the number of missed targets increased 500% and 450%, respectively, in comparison to the youngest age group. The results also suggest that target location is a significant factor. The subjects' target movement detection time for the 40deg and 50deg target movements increased 16% and 69%, respectively, as compared to the -20deg target.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2009.2031889","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2009.2031889","startPage":"1923","endPage":"1929","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/5337752/05238533.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5337752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Peripheral Visual Performance When Using Incandescent and LED Miner Cap Lamps","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Peripheral Visual Performance When Using Incandescent and LED Miner Cap Lamps","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","volume":"45","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5238533/","accessionNumber":"10984361","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5238533/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Peripheral Visual Performance When Using Incandescent and LED Miner Cap Lamps","sourcePdf":"tia-sammarco-2031889.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056626S","chronDate":"Nov.-dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"5337752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5337752","articleId":"5238533","onlineDate":"15 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5238535,"authors":[{"name":"Kyungmoo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Iowa, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Kyungmoo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37407636300"},{"name":"Meindert Niemeijer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Iowa, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Meindert","lastName":"Niemeijer","id":"37418440200"},{"name":"Mona K.

Segmentations of the optic disc cup and neuroretinal rim can provide important parameters for detecting and tracking this disease. The purpose of this study is to describe and evaluate a method that can automatically segment the optic disc cup and rim in spectral-domain 3-D OCT (SD-OCT) volumes. Four intraretinal surfaces were segmented using a fast multiscale 3-D graph search algorithm. After surface segmentation, the retina in each 3-D OCT scan was flattened to ensure a consistent optic nerve head shape. A set of 15 features, derived from the segmented intraretinal surfaces and voxel intensities in the SD-OCT volume, were used to train a classifier that can determine which A-scans in the OCT volume belong to the background, optic disc cup and rim. Finally, prior knowledge about the shapes of the cup and rim was incorporated into the system using a convex hull-based approach. Two glaucoma experts annotated the cup and rim area using planimetry, and the annotations of the first expert were used as the reference standard. A leave-one-subject-out experiment on 27 optic nerve head-centered OCT volumes (14 right eye scans and 13 left eye scans from 14 patients) was performed. Two different types of classification methods were compared, and experimental results showed that the best performing method had an unsigned error for the optic disc cup of 2.52 ? 0.87 pixels (0.076 ? 0.026 mm) and for the neuroretinal rim of 2.04 ? 0.86 pixels (0.061 ? 0.026 mm). The interobserver variability as indicated by the unsigned border positioning difference between the second expert observer and the reference standard was 2.54 ? 1.03 pixels (0.076 ? 0.031 mm for the optic disc cup and 2.14 ? 0.80 pixels (0.064 ? 0.024 mm for the neuroretinal rim. The unsigned error of the best performing method was not significantly different (p > 0.2) from the interobserver variability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5238535/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","volume":"29","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11049994","pubMedId":"19758857","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5238535/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Segmentation of the Optic Disc in 3-D OCT Scans of the Optic Nerve Head","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmentation of the Optic Disc in 3-D OCT Scans of the Optic Nerve Head","sourcePdf":"tmi-klee-2031324.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073359S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"5371922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"5371922","articleId":"5238535","onlineDate":"15 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":5238537,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00c9 Antonio Medina Hern\u00c1ndez","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Center for Research and Advanced Studies, National Polytechnic Institute, Mexicali, Mexico","Department of Mathematics and Physics, Aguascalientes Autonomous University, Aguascalientes, Mexico","Department of Electrical Engineering, National Polytechnic Institute, Mexico City, Mexico"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/5338640/5238537/5238537-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jos\u00e9 Antonio Medina Hern\u00e1ndez (S'07) received the B.S. degree in applied mathematics in 1991 from Aguascalientes Autonomous University, Aguascalientes, Mexico, and the M.S. degree in 1998 from the Center for Research and Advanced Studies, National Polytechnic Institute, Mexico City, Mexico, where he is currently working toward the Dr. Sci. degree in electrical engineering.","He is also with the Department of Mathematics and Physics, Aguascalientes Autonomous University.

Accurate detection of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) is particularly important in relation to life-threatening arrhythmias. In this paper, we introduce a model-based dynamic algorithm for tracking the ECG characteristic waveforms using an extended Kalman filter. The algorithm can work on single or multiple leads. A \"polargram''-a polar representation of the signal-is introduced, which is constructed using the Bayesian estimations of the state variables. The polargram allows the specification of a polar envelope for normal rhythms. Moreover, we propose a novel measure of signal fidelity by monitoring the covariance matrix of the innovation signals throughout the filtering procedure. PVCs are detected by simultaneous tracking the signal fidelity and the polar envelope. Five databases, including 40 records from MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, are used for differentiating normal, PVC, and other beats. Performance evaluation results show that the proposed method has an average detection accuracy of 99.10%, aggregate sensitivity of 98.77%, and aggregate positive predictivity of 97.47%. Furthermore, the method is capable of 100% accuracy for records that contain only PVCs and normal sinus beats. The results illustrate that the method can contribute to, and enhance the performance of clinical PVC detection.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2009.2031243","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5393902/05238547.pdf","startPage":"353","endPage":"362","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2009.2031243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Detection of Premature Ventricular Contractions Using a Wave-Based Bayesian Framework","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5238547/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Robust Detection of Premature Ventricular Contractions Using a Wave-Based Bayesian Framework","volume":"57","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11071378","pubMedId":"19758851","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5238547/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Detection of Premature Ventricular Contractions Using a Wave-Based Bayesian Framework","sourcePdf":"tbme-sayadi-2031243.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079185S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5393902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"5393902","articleId":"5238547","onlineDate":"15 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":5238550,"authors":[{"name":"Ricardo J.

Additionally, to minimize client download times, such systems perform extensive network and server measurements and use them to redirect clients to different servers over short time scales. In this paper, we explore techniques for inferring and exploiting network measurements performed by the largest CDN, Akamai; our objective is to locate and utilize quality Internet paths \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">without</i>\n performing extensive path probing or monitoring. Our contributions are threefold. First, we conduct a broad measurement study of Akamai's CDN. We probe Akamai's network from 140 PlanetLab (PL) vantage points for two months. We find that Akamai redirection times, while slightly higher than advertised, are sufficiently low to be useful for network control. Second, we empirically show that Akamai redirections overwhelmingly correlate with \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">network</i>\n latencies on the paths between clients and the Akamai servers. Finally, we illustrate how large-scale overlay networks can exploit Akamai redirections to identify the best detouring nodes for one-hop source routing. Our research shows that in more than 50% of investigated scenarios, it is better to route through the nodes \u00bfrecommended\u00bf by Akamai than to use the direct paths. Because this is not the case for the rest of the scenarios, we develop low-overhead pruning algorithms that avoid Akamai-driven paths when they are not beneficial. Because these Akamai nodes are part of a closed system, we provide a method for mapping Akamai-recommended paths to those in a generic overlay and demonstrate that these one-hop paths indeed outperform direct ones.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2009.2022157","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/5342336/05238553.pdf","startPage":"1752","endPage":"1765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2009.2022157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5342336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Drafting Behind Akamai: Inferring Network Conditions Based on CDN Redirections","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5238553","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5238553/","displayDocTitle":"Drafting Behind Akamai: Inferring Network Conditions Based on CDN Redirections","volume":"17","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11020212","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5238553/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Drafting Behind Akamai: Inferring Network Conditions Based on CDN Redirections","sourcePdf":"tnet-asu-2022157.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085712S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"5342336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"5342336","articleId":"5238553","onlineDate":"15 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5238555,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5338051/5238555/5238555-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peng Zhou (S\u201908) was born in Hanchuan, China, in 1984.

Two improved DPC schemes for the DFIG and the GSC are presented, respectively. The DPC for DFIG is to eliminate the torque and stator reactive power pulsations, while the DPC for GSC is to compensate for the pulsations of stator active power. In order to provide enhanced control performance of the overall system, the resonant controllers tuned at the fundamental and double grid frequency are applied in the improved DPC to eliminate the torque and power pulsations produced by the transient unbalanced grid faults, so that the output power of DFIG and GSC can be directly regulated without any necessity of the positive and negative sequence decomposition. The effectiveness of the proposed DPC strategy is verified by the simulation results of a 2-MW DFIG system under unbalanced grid voltage conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5338051/05238555.pdf","startPage":"2465","endPage":"2474","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2032188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2032188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338051","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5238555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Direct Power Control of a DFIG-Based Wind Turbine During Network Unbalance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Wind turbines","Stators","Torque control","Control systems","Induction generators","Wind power generation","Reactive power","Resonance","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous generators","power generation control","power system stability","wind turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DFIG-based wind turbine","network unbalance","coordinate direct power control strategy","doubly fed induction generator","grid side converter","torque","power pulsations","grid voltage conditions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Direct power control","doubly fed induction generator","network unbalance","resonant controller","wind turbine"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5238555/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Improved Direct Power Control of a DFIG-Based Wind Turbine During Network Unbalance","volume":"24","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5238555/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11003592","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Direct Power Control of a DFIG-Based Wind Turbine During Network Unbalance","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhou-2032188.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076984S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5338051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"5338051","articleId":"5238555","onlineDate":"15 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5238564,"authors":[{"name":"Dave Reid","affiliation":["Device Modeling Group, Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5247140/5238564/5238564-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dave Reid received the B.Eng. degree in electronics engineering from the University of Glasgow, Glasgow, U.K., in 2007, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Device Modelling Group, Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, working on large-scale statistical simulation of intrinsic parameter fluctuations in MOSFETs using grid and HPC technology.","His research interests include high-performance parallel computing and device modeling."]},"firstName":"Dave","lastName":"Reid","id":"37403800300"},{"name":"Campbell Millar","affiliation":["Device Modeling Group, Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5247140/5238564/5238564-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Campbell Millar received the B.Eng. degree in electronics engineering with music and the Ph.D. degree in 3-D simulation of bionanoelectronics from the University of Glasgow, Glasgow, U.K., in 1999 and 2004, respectively.","From 2004 to 2006, he participated in the bionanotechnology IRC and developed advanced simulation codes for the simulation of charge transport in biological macromolecules.

The proposed methodology uses the concept of a correlation matrix, which transforms the process level information to the device and circuit level information through the BSIM model parameters. The proposed methodology has been successfully implemented on an advanced CMOS process. Our results show a strong linear correlation for the data obtained from two techniques namely TCAD technique and the standard HSPICE simulation technique. In both cases the process conditions were kept identical for comparison.","doi":"10.1109/TSM.2009.2031782","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel5/66/5291681/05238565.pdf","startPage":"544","endPage":"551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSM.2009.2031782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5291681","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5238565","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Approach to Link Process Parameters to BSIM Model Parameters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5238565/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Approach to Link Process Parameters to BSIM Model Parameters","volume":"22","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5238565/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10957867","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Approach to Link Process Parameters to BSIM Model Parameters","sourcePdf":"22tsm04-smande-2031782.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06623S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"66","isNumber":"5291681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5291681","articleId":"5238565","onlineDate":"15 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5238569,"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5609231/5238569/5238569-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gregory Kengho Chen (S\u201907) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 2006 and 2009, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include SRAM, power management, and energy harvesting."]},"firstName":"Gregory","lastName":"Chen","id":"37536179800"},{"name":"Dennis Sylvester","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5609231/5238569/5238569-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Dennis Sylvester (S\u201995\u2013M\u201900\u2013SM\u201904) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, where his dissertation research was recognized by the David J.

PLLs are implemented inside a higher level controller to estimate the grid-voltage phase angle and then control the energy transfer between the power converter and the AC mains. The tuning of the PLL is not a trivial task, particularly when considering power-quality phenomena. In a general way, PLLs with a low bandwidth (low-gain PLLs) are required when handling distorted voltages. It is analytically demonstrated in this paper that low-gain PLLs have more tradeoffs than high-gain PLLs (e.g., PLLs for communications); it is not possible to optimize the settling time for a phase jump without making slower the PLL response to frequency variations. Existing tuning methods do not take into account low-gain features, which may result in nonoptimum designs. The proposed PLL tuning methodology is based on inspection of frequency-domain diagrams and, contrary to the other existing tuning methods, takes into account ldquolow-gainrdquo dynamics. It assures an optimized performance in the presence of any kind of disturbances in the grid. From a practical point of view, the proposed tuning procedure is very intuitive for controller designs. Some significant design examples and experimental results, obtained from a discrete implementation (dSpace platform), are provided in order to validate the theoretical approaches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tuning of Phase-Locked Loops for Power Converters Under Distorted Utility Conditions","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2009.2031790","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/5337752/05238582.pdf","startPage":"2039","endPage":"2047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2009.2031790","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5337752","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5238582","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5238582/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Tuning of Phase-Locked Loops for Power Converters Under Distorted Utility Conditions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5238582/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","publicationDate":"Nov.-dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10979316","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tuning of Phase-Locked Loops for Power Converters Under Distorted Utility Conditions","sourcePdf":"tia-freijedo-2031790.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072973S","chronDate":"Nov.-dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"5337752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"158","xplore-issue":"5337752","articleId":"5238582","onlineDate":"15 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5238598,"authors":[{"name":"Reuven Cohen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Reuven","lastName":"Cohen","id":"37267919100"},{"name":"Liran Katzir","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Liran","lastName":"Katzir","id":"37282335100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6692"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2566"}],"articleNumber":"5238598","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":385},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Association for Computing Machinery","url":"http://www.acm.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) is one of the most important modulation and access methods for the future mobile networks. Before transmitting a frame on the downlink, an OFDMA base station has to invoke an algorithm that determines which of the pending packets will be transmitted, what modulation should be used for each of them, and how to construct the complex OFDMA frame matrix as a collection of rectangles that fit into a single matrix with fixed dimensions. We propose efficient algorithms, with performance guarantee, that solve this intricate OFDMA scheduling problem by breaking it down into two subproblems, referred to as macro and micro scheduling.

We present a simple method to define the formation of multi-agents and individual identities (IDs) of agents. Two decentralized coordination and navigation techniques are proposed for the formation of rovers. Agents decide their own behaviors onboard depending upon the motion initiative of the master agent of the formation. In these approaches, any agent can estimate behavior of other agents in the formation. These will reduce the dependency of individual agent on other agents while taking decisions. These approaches reduce the communication burden on the formation where only the master agent broadcasts its motion status per sampled time. Any front agent can act as a master agent without affecting the formation in case of fault in initial master agent. The main idea of this paper is to develop an adequate computational model under which agents in the formation will perform to coordinate among each other. Assignments of IDs to agents are very useful in real-time applications. These proposed schemes are suitable for obstacle avoidance in unknown environment as a whole formation. Agents are free from collision among each other during navigation. These schemes can be used for velocity as well as orientation alignment problems for a multi-agent rover network. These schemes are tested with extensive simulations and responses of agents show satisfactory performances to deal with different environmental conditions.","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2009.2031012","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/4267003/5238794/05238599.pdf","startPage":"369","endPage":"381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2009.2031012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238794","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized Motion Coordination for a Formation of Rovers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5238599","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5238599/","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Motion Coordination for a Formation of Rovers","volume":"3","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10869295","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5238599/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Motion Coordination for a Formation of Rovers","sourcePdf":"jsyst-ray-2031012.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091495S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"5238794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5238794","articleId":"5238599","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5238605,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Jun Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Jun","lastName":"Lee","id":"37600714900"},{"name":"Ho min Eum","affiliation":["Broadcasting System Research Department, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ho min","lastName":"Eum","id":"37391611700"},{"name":"Yong-Tae Lee","affiliation":["Broadcasting System Research Department, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yong-Tae","lastName":"Lee","id":"37293398800"},{"name":"Kyung Sik Son","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyung Sik","lastName":"Son","id":"37286417700"},{"name":"Hyoung-Nam Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyoung-Nam","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280366800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9316"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9611"}],"articleNumber":"5238605","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Broadcast Technology Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/bt/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Repeaters","Optical character recognition software","Frequency","Acoustic distortion","Filters","Commercialization","Degradation","Doppler effect","Multimedia communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","broadcasting","channel estimation","convex programming","feedback","multimedia systems","repeaters","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback cancellers","T-DMB","on-channel repeaters","out-band spectrum","spectrum distortion problem","pre-whitening filters","feedback channel","Doppler effects","out-band spectrum distortion","convex combination algorithm","time-varying feedback channels","time-invariant channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convex combination algorithm","feedback canceller","pre-whitening filter","T-DMB repeater"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a feedback canceller (FC) for T-DMB repeaters. Though the conventional FC of T-DMB repeaters has a good feedback cancellation performance, it distorts the recovered signal's out-band spectrum. This spectrum distortion problem is very crucial for commercializing T-DMB repeaters. The feedback canceller with pre-whitening filters (PWFs), which estimates the feedback channel using whitened input signals, can compensate this spectrum problem. However the feedback canceling performance degradation occurs when the feedback channel varies with Doppler effects. To compensate the out-band spectrum distortion and cope with the variation of feedback channel, we propose a novel FC based on the convex combination algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed FC can remove clearly the out-band spectrum distortion of the recovered signal with improved the feedback canceling performance in both time-invariant and time-varying feedback channels.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2009.2030450","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/5310848/05238605.pdf","startPage":"810","endPage":"817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2009.2030450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5310848","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5238605","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Feedback Cancellers for T-DMB On-Channel Repeaters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Feedback Cancellers for T-DMB On-Channel Repeaters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5238605/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","volume":"55","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5238605/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10980259","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Feedback Cancellers for T-DMB On-Channel Repeaters","sourcePdf":"tbc-kim-2030450.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057254S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"5310848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5310848","articleId":"5238605","onlineDate":"15 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":5238606,"authors":[{"name":"Javier Leonardo Araque Quijano","affiliation":["Antenna and EMC Laboratory (LACE), Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy"],"firstName":"Javier Leonardo","lastName":"Araque Quijano","id":"37546457500"},{"name":"Giuseppe Vecchi","affiliation":["Antenna and EMC Laboratory (LACE), Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Vecchi","id":"37280948600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"5238606","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":90,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":830},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface reconstruction","Magnetic field measurement","Integral equations","Antenna measurements","Testing","Current measurement","Electric variables measurement","Phase measurement","Data engineering","Extraterrestrial measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna theory","boundary integral equations","electromagnetic waves","Maxwell equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["source reconstruction","arbitrary 3D surfaces","arbitrary three-dimensional surfaces","rigorous boundary integral field identities","Maxwellian equation","dual integral-equation formulation","single-equation formulation","quantitative assessment","antenna diagnostics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna diagnostics","inverse source","source reconstruction"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel formulation of the source reconstruction problem on arbitrary three-dimensional (3-D) surfaces based on integral equations.

The design, fabrication, and characterization of a dedicated chip are described, in which an 8 \u00d7 1 optical beamforming network, an optical sideband filter for single-sideband suppressed carrier modulation, and a carrier re-insertion coupler for balanced optical detection are integrated. The chip was designed for satellite television reception using a broadband PAA, and was realized in a low-loss, CMOS-compatible optical waveguide technology. Tuning is performed thermo-optically, with a switching time of 1 ms. Group delay response and power response measurements show the correct operation of the OBFN and OSBF, respectively. Measurements on a complete beamformer prototype (including the electro-optical and opto-electrical conversions) demonstrate an optical sideband suppression of 25 dB, RF-to-RF delay generation up to 0.63 ns with a phase accuracy better than \u00bf/10 radians, and coherent combining of four RF input signals, all in a frequency range of 1-2 GHz.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Ring Resonator-Based Integrated Photonic Beamformer for Broadband Phased Array Receive Antennas\u2014Part II: Experimental Prototype","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2032137","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5350899/05238608.pdf","startPage":"19","endPage":"31","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2032137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5350899","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5238608","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5238608/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2010","displayDocTitle":"Novel Ring Resonator-Based Integrated Photonic Beamformer for Broadband Phased Array Receive Antennas\u2014Part II: Experimental Prototype","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5238608/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2009","publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2010","accessionNumber":"11147837","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Ring Resonator-Based Integrated Photonic Beamformer for Broadband Phased Array Receive Antennas\u2014Part II: Experimental Prototype","sourcePdf":"jlt-ameijerink-2032137.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113838S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2010","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5350899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"5350899","articleId":"5238608","onlineDate":"15 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5238613,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5247140/5238613/5238613-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hong Li (S'07) received the B.E. degree in electronic engineering from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2003 and the M.S. degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2008.

A frequency-dependent impedance extraction method is developed for both single-walled CNT (SWCNT) and multiwalled CNT (MWCNT) bundle interconnects. The method is subsequently verified by comparing the results with those derived directly from the Maxwell's equations. Our analysis reveals for the first time that skin effect in CNT (particularly MWCNT) bundles is significantly reduced compared to that in conventional metal conductors, which makes them very attractive and promising material for high-frequency applications, including high-quality (Q) factor on-chip inductor design in high-performance RF/mixed-signal circuits. It is shown that such unique high-frequency properties of CNTs essentially arise due to their large momentum relaxation time (leading to their large kinetic inductance), which causes the skin depths to saturate with frequency and thereby limits resistance increase at high frequencies in a bundle structure. It is subsequently shown that CNT-based planar spiral inductors can achieve more than three times higher Q factor than their Cu-based counterparts without using any magnetic materials or Q factor enhancement techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Frequency Analysis of Carbon Nanotube Interconnects and Implications for On-Chip Inductor Design","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/TED.2009.2028395","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/5247140/05238613.pdf","startPage":"2202","endPage":"2214","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2009.2028395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5247140","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5238613","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5238613/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"High-Frequency Analysis of Carbon Nanotube Interconnects and Implications for On-Chip Inductor Design","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5238613/","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10878819","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Frequency Analysis of Carbon Nanotube Interconnects and Implications for On-Chip Inductor Design","sourcePdf":"ted-banerjee-2028395.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108517S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5247140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"125","xplore-issue":"5247140","articleId":"5238613","onlineDate":"15 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5238617,"authors":[{"name":"Hadas Kress-Gazit","affiliation":["Mechanical and AeroSpace Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/5338866/5238617/5238617-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hadas Kress-Gazit (S'06\u2013M'09) received the Ph.D.degree in electrical and systems engineering from the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, in 2008.","She is currently an Assistant Professor with Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY.

In addition, our framework explicitly captures sensor specifications that depend on the environment with which the robot is interacting, which results in a novel paradigm for sensor-based temporal-logic-motion planning. As one robot is part of the environment of another robot, our sensor-based framework very naturally captures multirobot specifications in a decentralized manner. Our computational approach is based on first creating discrete controllers satisfying specific LTL formulas. If feasible, the discrete controller is then used to guide the sensor-based composition of continuous controllers, which results in a hybrid controller satisfying the high-level specification but only if the environment is admissible.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338866","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2009.2030225","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/5338866/05238617.pdf","startPage":"1370","endPage":"1381","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2009.2030225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temporal-Logic-Based Reactive Mission and Motion Planning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Temporal-Logic-Based Reactive Mission and Motion Planning","volume":"25","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5238617/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11001398","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5238617/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temporal-Logic-Based Reactive Mission and Motion Planning","sourcePdf":"tro-kress-gazit-2030225.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070151S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"5338866","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"384","xplore-issue":"5338866","articleId":"5238617","onlineDate":"15 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5238622,"authors":[{"name":"Seung-Yeup Hyun","affiliation":["Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/5319721/5238622/5238622-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seung-Yeup Hyun was born in Jeju, Korea, on August 3, 1974.

The material discontinuity between lossy insulating and surrounding media is corrected as the time-domain boundary condition. The convolution term of the boundary condition is solved by employing a recursive technique. Applying the contour-path integration to the FDTD unit cells around the wire, one may find the coarse-grid-based equation with the correction term and factors for the material discontinuity and the quasi-static field behavior around the wire. In the 2-D cylindrical coordinates with rotational symmetry, the validity of the proposed model is confirmed by an impedance analysis of insulated and resistive antennas according to the electrical properties of insulating and surrounding media, as well as the choice of cell size.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/5319721/05238622.pdf","startPage":"1009","endPage":"1016","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2009.2028612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2009.2028612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5319721","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5238622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thin-Wire Model Using Subcellular Extensions in the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Analysis of Thin and Lossy Insulated Cylindrical Structures in Lossy Media","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time domain analysis","Finite difference methods","Wire","Feeds","Media","Boundary conditions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["absorbing media","finite difference time-domain analysis","insulated wires"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite-difference time-domain analysis","lossy insulated cylindrical structures","lossy media","subcellular thin-wire model","material discontinuity","time-domain boundary condition","recursive technique","contour-path integration","coarse-grid-based equation","quasi-static field behavior","2D cylindrical coordinates","rotational symmetry","impedance analysis","resistive antennas","electrical properties","resistive coated cylinders"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods","insulated cylinders","thin wires"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5238622/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Thin-Wire Model Using Subcellular Extensions in the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Analysis of Thin and Lossy Insulated Cylindrical Structures in Lossy Media","volume":"51","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5238622/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10978729","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thin-Wire Model Using Subcellular Extensions in the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Analysis of Thin and Lossy Insulated Cylindrical Structures in Lossy Media","sourcePdf":"temc-kim-2028612.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072495S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"5319721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5319721","articleId":"5238622","onlineDate":"15 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5238632,"authors":[{"name":"Rixin Lai","affiliation":["Electronic Power Conversion Laboratory, GE Global Research Center, Niskayuna, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5338051/5238632/5238632-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rixin Lai (S\u201907) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2002 and 2005, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Center for Power Electronics Systems, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, in 2008.","He joined the Electronic Power Conversion Laboratory, GE Global Research Center, Niskayuna, NY, in 2009.

For example, due to competitive pressure, foundries have started to incent the design of manufacturing-friendly ICs through reduced model guardbands when designers adopt layout restrictions. The industry also continuously weighs the economic viability of relaxing process variation limits in the technology roadmap (available: http://public.itrs.net). Our work gives the first-ever quantification of the impact of model guardband reduction on outcomes from the synthesis, place and route (SP&R) implementation flow. We assess the impact of model guardband reduction on various metrics of design cycle time and design quality, using open-source cores and production (specifically, ARM/TSMC) 90- and 65-nm libraries and technologies as well as an industrial embedded processor core implemented in 45 nm. Our experimental data clearly shows the potential design quality and turnaround time benefits of model guardband reduction. For example, in our open-source cores, on average we observe 13% standard-cell area reduction, 12% routed wirelength reduction, 13% dynamic power reduction and 19% leakage power reduction as the consequence of a 40% reduction in library model guardband; 40% is the amount of guardband reduction reported by IBM for a variation-aware timing methodology. For the embedded processor core we observe up to 8% standard-cell area reduction, 7% routed wirelength reduction, 5% dynamic power reduction, and 10% leakage power reduction at 30% guardband reduction. We also report a set of fine-grain SPICE simulations that accurately assesses the impact of process guardband reduction, as distinguished from overall guardband reductions, on yield. We observe up to 4% increase in number of good dies per wafer at 27% process guardband reduction (i.e., with fixed voltage and temperature). Our results suggest that there is justification for the design, EDA and process communities to enable guardband reduction as an economic incentive for manufacturing-friendly design practices.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel5/66/5291681/05238633.pdf","startPage":"552","endPage":"565","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Guardband Reduction On Design Outcomes: A Quantitative Approach","doi":"10.1109/TSM.2009.2031789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5291681","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSM.2009.2031789","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5238633","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5238633/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Guardband Reduction On Design Outcomes: A Quantitative Approach","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10957854","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"22","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5238633/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Guardband Reduction On Design Outcomes: A Quantitative Approach","sourcePdf":"22tsm04-ksamadi-2031789.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100439S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"66","isNumber":"5291681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5291681","articleId":"5238633","onlineDate":"15 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5238641,"authors":[{"name":"Lucas H.

To exploit the periodic nature of the motion, we use a Fourier harmonic representation to model the temporal evolution of the motion field for the entire sequence. We then determine the motion field simultaneously for the different image frames by estimating the parameters of this representation model, where the model order in the Fourier representation serves as a regularization parameter on the temporal coherence of the motion field. This approach can take advantage of the statistics of all the available data in the image sequence. In our experiments, we tested the proposed approach on several motion types at different noise levels, including translational motion, convergent/divergent motion, and cardiac motion. Our results demonstrate that this approach could lead to more robust estimation of the motion field in the presence of strong imaging noise compared to a frame-by-frame estimation approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5353839/05238645.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2032341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2032341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5353839","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5238645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical Flow Estimation for a Periodic Image Sequence","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image motion analysis","Image sequences","Motion estimation","Parameter estimation","Coherence","Statistics","Testing","Noise level","Image converters","Noise robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","image sequences","motion estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical flow estimation","periodic image sequence","temporal modeling approach","image motion","Fourier harmonic representation","motion field","translational motion","convergent-divergent motion","cardiac motion","frame-by-frame estimation approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fourier harmonics","motion estimation","optical flow","spatiotemporal regularization"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Cardiac-Gated Imaging Techniques","Fourier Analysis","Heart","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Motion","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5238645/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optical Flow Estimation for a Periodic Image Sequence","volume":"19","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5238645/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11020071","pubMedId":"19758864","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical Flow Estimation for a Periodic Image Sequence","sourcePdf":"tip-yang-2032341.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081367S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5353839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5353839","articleId":"5238645","onlineDate":"15 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5238646,"authors":[{"name":"Rodrigo Melo e Silva de Oliveira","affiliation":["Universidade Federal do Para, Belem, PA, BR"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/5319721/5238646/5238646-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rodrigo Melo e Silva de Oliveira was born in Bras\u00edlia-DF, Brazil, in 1980.

Markets are growing busier, and the data-rates of these feeds are already in the gigabit range, from which customers must extract and process messages with sub-millisecond latency.This paper presents an FPGA accelerated approach to market data feed processing, using an FPGA connected directly to the network to parse, optionally decompress, and filter the feed, and then to push the decoded messages directly into the memory of a general purpose processor. Such a solution offers flexibility, as the FPGA can be reconfigured for new data feed formats, and high throughput with low latency by eliminating the operating system's network stack.This approach is demonstrated using the Celoxica AMDC board, which accepts a pair of redundant data feeds over two gigabit Ethernet ports, parses and filters the data, then pushes relevant messages directly into system memory over the PCIe bus. Tests with an ORPA FAST data feed redistribution system show that the AMDC is able to process up to 3.5 M messages per second, 12 times the current real-world rate, while the complete system rebroadcasts at least 99% of packets with a latency of less than 26 us. The hardware portion of the design has a constant latency, irrespective of throughput, of 4 us.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Accelerated Low-Latency Market Data Feed Processing","publicationTitle":"2009 17th IEEE Symposium on High Performance Interconnects","doi":"10.1109/HOTI.2009.17","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th IEEE Symposium on High Performance Interconnects","pdfPath":"/iel5/5238649/5238650/05238679.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"89","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HOTI.2009.17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238650","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5238679","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5238679/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Accelerated Low-Latency Market Data Feed Processing","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5238679/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10869165","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Accelerated Low-Latency Market Data Feed Processing","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"3847a083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043969S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5238649","isNumber":"5238650","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5238649","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5238650","articleId":"5238679","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5238680,"authors":[{"name":"Nathan Farrington","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Nathan","lastName":"Farrington","id":"37540392100"},{"name":"Erik Rubow","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Rubow","id":"37595730800"},{"name":"Amin Vahdat","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Amin","lastName":"Vahdat","id":"37272030700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3847-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-4794"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5569"}],"articleNumber":"5238680","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":65,"citationCountPatent":16,"totalDownloads":892},"abstract":"Today, data center networks that scale to tens of thousands of ports require the use of highly-specialized ASICs, with correspondingly high development costs. Simultaneously, these networks also face significant performance and management limitations. Just as commodity processors and disks now form the basis of computing and storage in the data center, we argue that there is an opportunity to leverage emerging high-speed commodity merchant switch silicon as the basis for a scalable, cost-effective, modular, and more manageable data center network fabric. This paper describes how to save cost and power by repackaging an entire data center network as a distributed multi-stage switch using a fat-tree topology and merchant silicon instead of proprietary ASICs. Compared to a fat tree of discrete packet switches, a 3,456-port 10 Gigabit Ethernet realization of our architecture costs 52% less, consumes 31% less power, occupies 84% less space, and reduces the number of long, cumbersome cables from 6,912 down to 96, relative to existing approaches.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th IEEE Symposium on High Performance Interconnects","pdfPath":"/iel5/5238649/5238650/05238680.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"102","publicationTitle":"2009 17th IEEE Symposium on High Performance Interconnects","doi":"10.1109/HOTI.2009.11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HOTI.2009.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238650","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5238680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data Center Switch Architecture in the Age of Merchant Silicon","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Silicon","Costs","Computer network management","Computer networks","Fabrics","Network topology","Packet switching","Ethernet networks","Cables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","computer network management","local area networks","telecommunication network topology","telecommunication switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data center switch architecture","commodity processors","disks","high-speed commodity merchant switch silicon","data center network fabric management","distributed multistage switch","fat-tree topology","Ethernet"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["data center","network","ethernet","switch","fat tree","commodity","asic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5238680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Data Center Switch Architecture in the Age of Merchant Silicon","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5238680/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10869166","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Center Switch Architecture in the Age of Merchant Silicon","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"3847a093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052998S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5238649","isNumber":"5238650","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5238649","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"5238650","articleId":"5238680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5238689,"authors":[{"name":"Sean O'Melia","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Lincoln Laboratory, Lexington, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5609231/5238689/5238689-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sean O'Melia (M'93) received the M.S. degree in computer engineering from the University of Massachusetts at Lowell, Lowell, in 2007.

The most computationally intensive operations of each algorithm are off-loaded to a set of newly defined instructions. The additional hardware required to support these instructions is integrated into the processor's data path. For each of the targeted algorithms, comparisons are presented between traditional software implementations and new implementations that take advantage of the extended instruction set architecture. Results show that the utilization of the proposed instructions significantly reduces program code size, and improves encryption and decryption throughput. Moreover, the additional hardware resources required to support the instruction set extensions increase the total area of the processor by less than 65%. Finally, it will be shown that the throughputs for triple DES, IDEA, and AES are approximately the same when accelerated via instruction set extensions. This allows for seamless and transparent algorithm agility as one algorithm may be easily replaced by another algorithm with minimal performance degradation.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2025171","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5609231/05238689.pdf","startPage":"1505","endPage":"1518","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2025171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5609231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing the Performance of Symmetric-Key Cryptography via Instruction Set Extensions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5238689/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing the Performance of Symmetric-Key Cryptography via Instruction Set Extensions","volume":"18","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11597435","htmlLink":"/document/5238689/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing the Performance of Symmetric-Key Cryptography via Instruction Set Extensions","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-aelbirt-2025171-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140047S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5609231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5609231","articleId":"5238689","onlineDate":"15 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5238713,"authors":[{"name":"Jian-Bo Cao","affiliation":["Transportation College, Zhejiang Normal University, ZJNU, Jinhua, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5226771/5238713/5238713-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jian-Bo Cao was born in Shandong, China, in 1980.

Carrier-based PWM and space vector PWM (SVPWM) are the most common options. This paper is aimed at providing a comprehensive relationship between carrier-based PWM and SVPWM techniques. The relationship is determined in terms of modulation signals and space vectors, modulation signals and space vector sectors, and switching pattern of space vector and type of carrier. Distribution of zero vector is discussed, leading to different types of modulation schemes. The practical implementation issues of carrier-based PWM and SVPWM are discussed. Simulation results and their experimental validation are provided to support the analytical findings.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2029051","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2029051","startPage":"2379","endPage":"2390","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5226771/05238714.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226771","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comprehensive Relationship Between Carrier-Based PWM and Space Vector PWM in a Five-Phase VSI","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Comprehensive Relationship Between Carrier-Based PWM and Space Vector PWM in a Five-Phase VSI","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","volume":"24","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5238714/","accessionNumber":"10878404","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5238714/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comprehensive Relationship Between Carrier-Based PWM and Space Vector PWM in a Five-Phase VSI","sourcePdf":"tpel-iqbal-2029051.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057505S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5226771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"114","xplore-issue":"5226771","articleId":"5238714","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":5238717,"authors":[{"name":"Zuleita Ka Ming Ho","affiliation":["Eurecom Institute, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"bio":{"p":["Zuleita Ka Ming Ho (S'05) enrolled into Hong Kong University of Science and Technology through the Early Admission for Outstanding Secondary Six Students in 2001 and graduated from the Department of electrical and Computer Engineering with the B.Eng (Distinction 1st Hons) and M.Phil. degrees in 2004 and 2006.","She is currently working towards the Ph.D degree in mobile communications at EURECOM, Sophia-Antipolis, France.

However, conventional cross-layer designs all require channel state information at the base station (CSIT) which is difficult to obtain in practice. In this paper, we focus on cross-layer resource optimization based on ACK/NAK feedback flows in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems without explicit CSIT. While the problem can be modeled as Markov decision process (MDP), brute-force approach by policy iteration or value iteration cannot lead to any viable solution. Thus, we derive a simple closed-form solution for the MDP cross-layer problem, which is asymptotically optimal for sufficiently small target packet error rate (PER). The proposed solution also has low complexity and is suitable for real-time implementation. It is also shown to achieve significant performance gain compared with systems that do not utilize the ACK/NAK feedbacks for cross-layer designs or cross-layer systems that utilize very unreliable CSIT for adaptation with mismatch in CSIT error statistics.

The focus is on signal processing applications where the Krylov subspace is defined by the unknown second-order statistics of the observed samples and the signature vector associated with the desired parameter. In particular, the consistency of traditionally optimal sample estimators is revised and analytically characterized under a practically more relevant asymptotic regime, according to which not only the number of samples but also the observation dimension grow without bound at the same rate. Furthermore, an improved construction of a class of Krylov subspace estimators is proposed based on the generalized consistent estimation of a set of vector-valued power functions of the observation covariance matrix. To that effect, an extension of some known results from random matrix theory on the estimation of certain spectral functions of the covariance matrix to the convergence of not only the covariance eigenspectrum but also the associated eigensubspaces is provided. A new family of estimators is derived that generalizes conventional implementations by proving to be consistent for observations of arbitrarily high dimension. The proposed estimators are shown to outperform traditional constructions via the numerical evaluation of the solution to two fundamental problems in sensor array signal processing, namely the problem of estimating the power of an intended source and the estimation of the principal eigenspace and dominant eigenmodes of a structured covariance matrix.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2025094","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5238723/05238728.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2025094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238723","startPage":"3787","endPage":"3800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Consistent Estimation on Low-Rank Krylov Subspaces of Arbitrarily High Dimension","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5238728","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Consistent Estimation on Low-Rank Krylov Subspaces of Arbitrarily High Dimension","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5238728/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10869436","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5238728/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Consistent Estimation on Low-Rank Krylov Subspaces of Arbitrarily High Dimension","sourcePdf":"57tsp10-frubio-2025094.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101078S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5238723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5238723","articleId":"5238728","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5238733,"authors":[{"name":"Abla Kammoun","affiliation":["Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France"],"bio":{"p":["Abla Kammoun was born in Sfax, Tunisia.

However, this approximation being inaccurate for the estimation of some performance metrics such as the bit error rate (BER) and the outage probability, especially for small system dimensions, Li proposed convincingly to assume that the SNR follows a generalized gamma distribution which parameters are tuned by computing the first three asymptotic moments of the SNR. In this paper, this technique is generalized to (receive) correlated channels, and closed-form expressions for the first three asymptotic moments of the SNR are provided. To obtain these results, a random matrix theory technique adapted to matrices with Gaussian elements is used. This technique is believed to be simple, efficient, and of broad interest in wireless communications.

A PIC group decoding decodes the symbols embedded in an STBC by dividing them into several groups and decoding each group separately after a linear PIC operation is implemented. It can be viewed as an intermediate decoding between the maximum likelihood (ML) receiver that decodes all the embedded symbols together, i.e., all the embedded symbols are in a single group, and the zero-forcing (ZF) receiver that decodes all the embedded symbols separately and independently, i.e., each group has and only has one embedded symbol, after the ZF operation is implemented. The PIC group decoding provides a framework to adjust the complexity-performance tradeoff by choosing the sizes of the information symbol groups. Our proposed design criterion (group independence) for the PIC group decoding to achieve full diversity is an intermediate condition between the loosest ML full rank criterion of codewords and the strongest ZF linear independence condition of the column vectors in the equivalent channel matrix. We also propose asymptotic optimal (AO) group decoding algorithm which is an intermediate decoding between the MMSE decoding algorithm and the ML decoding algorithm. The design criterion for the PIC group decoding can be applied to the AO group decoding algorithm because of its asymptotic optimality. It is well-known that the symbol rate for a full rank linear STBC can be full, i.e., \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">nt</i>\n, for \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">nt</i>\n transmit antennas. It has been recently shown that its rate is upper bounded by 1 if a code achieves full diversity with a linear receiver. The intermediate criterion proposed in this paper provides the possibility for codes of rates between \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">nt</i>\n and 1 that achieve full diversity with the PIC group decoding. This therefore provides a complexity-performance-rate tradeoff.

Initially, the case in which the product of the estimate error and transmitted signal is assumed to be Gaussian noise is considered. In this case, it is shown that bit energy requirements grow without bound as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) goes to zero, and the minimum bit energy is achieved at a nonzero SNR value below which one should not operate. The effect of the block length on both the minimum bit energy and the SNR value at which the minimum is achieved is investigated. Flash training and transmission schemes are analyzed and shown to improve the energy efficiency in the low-SNR regime. In the second part of this paper, the capacity and energy efficiency of training-based schemes are investigated when the channel input vector in each coherence block is subject to peak power constraints.

For signals that admit sparse representations over a known dictionary, a commonly used denoising technique is to seek the sparsest representation that synthesizes a signal close enough to the corrupted one. As this problem is too complex in general, approximation methods, such as greedy pursuit algorithms, are often employed. In this line of reasoning, we are led to believe that detection of the sparsest representation is key in the success of the denoising goal. Does this mean that other competitive and slightly inferior sparse representations are meaningless? Suppose we are served with a group of competing sparse representations, each claiming to explain the signal differently. Can those be fused somehow to lead to a better result? Surprisingly, the answer to this question is positive; merging these representations can form a more accurate (in the mean-squared-error (MSE) sense), yet dense, estimate of the original signal even when the latter is known to be sparse. In this paper, we demonstrate this behavior, propose a practical way to generate such a collection of representations by randomizing the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm, and produce a clear analytical justification for the superiority of the associated Randomized OMP (RandOMP) algorithm. We show that while the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimator aims to find and use the sparsest representation, the minimum mean- squared-error (MMSE) estimator leads to a fusion of representations to form its result. Thus, working with an appropriate mixture of candidate representations, we are surpassing the MAP and tending towards the MMSE estimate, and thereby getting a far more accurate estimation in terms of the expected lscr\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n -norm error.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2027565","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5238716/05238753.pdf","startPage":"4701","endPage":"4714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2027565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Plurality of Sparse Representations Is Better Than the Sparsest One Alone","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5238753","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5238753/","displayDocTitle":"A Plurality of Sparse Representations Is Better Than the Sparsest One Alone","volume":"55","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10869361","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Plurality of Sparse Representations Is Better Than the Sparsest One Alone","sourcePdf":"55tit10-melad-2027565.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054883S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","isNumber":"5238716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"115","articleId":"5238753","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5238755,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Jin Xu (S'07) received the B.E. degree from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, in 2002, and the M.Sc. degree from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, in 2005.","He is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY.

Both inner and outer bounds are proposed to the rate equivocation region for broadcast channels with confidential messages. The proposed inner bound generalizes Csiszar and Korner's rate equivocation region for broadcast channels with a single confidential message, Liu 's achievable rate region for broadcast channels with perfect secrecy, Marton's and Gel'fand-Pinsker's achievable rate region for general broadcast channels. The proposed outer bounds, together with the inner bound, help establish the rate equivocation region of several classes of discrete memoryless broadcast channels with confidential messages, including the less noisy, deterministic, and semideterministic broadcast channels.

In this paper, we characterize the information-theoretic performance of MIMO linear receivers in two different asymptotic regimes. For fixed number of antennas, we investigate the limit of error probability in the high-signal-to noise-ratio (SNR) regime in terms of the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT). Following this, we characterize the error probability for fixed SNR in the regime of large (but finite) number of antennas.As far as the DMT is concerned, we report a negative result: we show that both linear zero-forcing (ZF) and linear minimum mean- square error (MMSE) receivers achieve the same DMT, which is largely suboptimal even in the case where outer coding and deAcircnot coding is performed across the antennas. We also provide an apAcircnot proximate quantitative analysis of the markedly different behavior of the MMSE and ZF receivers at finite rate and nonasymptotic SNR, and show that while the ZF receiver achieves poor diversity at any finite rate, the MMSE receiver error curve slope flattens out progressively, as the coding rate increases. When SNR is fixed and the number of antennas becomes large, we show that the mutual information at the output of an MMSE or ZF linear receiver has fluctuations that converge in distribution to a Gaussian random variable, whose mean and variance can be characterized in closed form. This analysis extends to the linear reAcircnot ceiver case a well-known result previously obtained for the optimal receiver. Simulations reveal that the asymptotic analysis captures accurately the outage behavior of systems even with a moderate number of antennas.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2027493","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5238716/05238756.pdf","startPage":"4398","endPage":"4418","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2027493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic Performance of Linear Receivers in MIMO Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5238756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5238756/","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic Performance of Linear Receivers in MIMO Fading Channels","volume":"55","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10869364","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5238756/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic Performance of Linear Receivers in MIMO Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"55tit10-gcaire-2027493.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107864S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5238716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"5238716","articleId":"5238756","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5238757,"authors":[{"name":"Honggang Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada","State Key Laboratory of Information Security (Institute of Software), Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Honggang Hu received the B.S. degree in mathematics in June 2000, and the B.E. degree in electrical engineering in June 2001 from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, China, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Graduate School of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in July 2005.","From July 2005 to April 2007, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.

The system consists of a nomadic transmitter with several antennas, whose signal is received by multiple agents, exhibiting independent channel gains and an additive circular-symmetric Gaussian noise. In the nomadic regime, we assume that the agents do not have any decoding ability. These agents process their channel observations and forward them to the final destination through unidirectional lossless links with a fixed capacity. We propose new achievable rates based on elementary compression and on Wyner-Ziv (WZ)or chief executive officer (CEO) processing, for both fast-fading and block-fading channels, as well as for general discrete channels. The simpler two agents scheme is solved, up to an implicit equation with a single variable. Limiting the nomadic transmitter to circular-symmetric Gaussian signaling, new upper bounds are derived, based on the vector version of the entropy power inequality. Several asymptotic settings are analyzed. In addition, the upper bounds are analytically shown to be tight for several examples, while numerical calculations reveal a rather small gap in a finite 2 times 2 setting. The advantage of the WZ approach over elementary compression is shown, where only the former can achieve the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT).","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5238716/05238767.pdf","startPage":"4419","endPage":"4438","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2027579","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2027579","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238716","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5238767","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed MIMO Receiver\u2014Achievable Rates and Upper Bounds","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Upper bound","Transmitters","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Additive noise","Gaussian noise","Decoding","Equations","Limiting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","diversity reception","fading channels","Gaussian noise","MIMO communication","multiplexing","radio receivers","radio transmitters","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed MIMO receiver","multiple-input multiple-output system","nomadic transmitter","antennas","multiple agents","independent channel gains","circular-symmetric Gaussian signaling","decoding ability","unidirectional lossless links","elementary compression","Wyner-Ziv processing","chief executive officer processing","fast-fading channel","block-fading channel","discrete channels","entropy power inequality","upper bounds","diversity-multiplexing tradeoff"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chief executive officer (CEO) processing","com- press-and-forward","decentralized detection","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system","wireless networks","Wyner\u2013Ziv (WZ)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5238767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Distributed MIMO Receiver\u2014Achievable Rates and Upper Bounds","volume":"55","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10869372","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed MIMO Receiver\u2014Achievable Rates and Upper Bounds","sourcePdf":"55tit10-asanderovich-2027579.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089821S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","isNumber":"5238716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"44","articleId":"5238767","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5238768,"authors":[{"name":"Aslan Tchamkerten","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Electronics, Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France"],"bio":{"p":["Aslan Tchamkerten received the engineer physicist diploma in 2000, and the Ph.D. degree in communication in 2005, both from the Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland.","From 2005 to 2008, he was a Postdoctoral Associate in the Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge.

In the system model of interest, the message codeword is transmitted over a channel starting at a randomly chosen time within a prescribed window. The length of the window scales exponentially with the codeword length, where the scaling parameter is referred to as the asynchronism exponent. The receiver knows the transmission window, but not the transmission time. Communication rate is defined as the ratio between the message size and the elapsed time between when transmission commences and when the decoder makes a decision. Under this model, several aspects of the achievable tradeoff between the rate of reliable communication and the asynchronism exponent are quantified. First, the use of generalized constant-composition codebooks and sequential decoding is shown to be sufficient for achieving reliable communication under strictly positive asynchronism exponents at all rates less than the capacity of the synchronized channel. Second, the largest asynchronism exponent under which reliable communication is possible, regardless of rate, is characterized. In contrast to traditional communication architectures, there is no separate synchronization phase in the coding scheme. Rather, synchronization and communication are implemented jointly. The results are relevant to a variety of sensor network and other applications in which intermittent communication is involved.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Information analysis","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Communication systems","Transmitters","Monitoring","Telecommunication network reliability","System analysis and design","Channel capacity","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","encoding","radio links","synchronisation","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous point-to-point communication","message codeword","communication reliability","constant-composition codebooks","sequential decoding","channel capacity","synchronization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Change detection","detection and isolation problem","error exponents","intermittent communication","quickest detection","sensor networks","sequential decoding","synchronization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2027484","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5238716/05238768.pdf","startPage":"4508","endPage":"4528","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238716","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2027484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Communication Under Strong Asynchronism","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5238768","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Communication Under Strong Asynchronism","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5238768/","volume":"55","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5238768/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10869373","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communication Under Strong Asynchronism","sourcePdf":"55tit10-atchamkerten-2027484.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13678S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5238716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5238716","articleId":"5238768","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5238770,"authors":[{"name":"Nianjun Zhou","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

Hierarchical protocols are known for their good scalability properties, and hence this paper considers a two-level hierarchical protocol. In such protocols, nodes need to keep track of shortest path information, link states and cluster membership. Two types of overheads are considered; the memory needed to store routing-related information, including link-states and cluster membership, and the control messages that need to be exchanged to keep track of the changes in the network. Memory overhead is important practically for dimensioning network nodes, while message routing overhead is important since it reduces the effective capacity of the network to carry user data (vis-a-vis control data). The scalability properties of the message routing overhead are analyzed for different modes of network scaling. Practical implications, such as optimal cluster size, average/fixed memory requirement and routing protocol parameter selections are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2027478","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5238716/05238770.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238716","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2027478","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"4608","endPage":"4625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information Theoretic Analysis of Proactive Routing Overhead in Mobile <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">Ad Hoc</emphasis> Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5238770","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Information Theoretic Analysis of Proactive Routing Overhead in Mobile <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">Ad Hoc</emphasis> Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5238770/","volume":"55","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5238770/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10869374","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information Theoretic Analysis of Proactive Routing Overhead in Mobile <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">Ad Hoc</emphasis> Networks","sourcePdf":"55tit10-aabouzeid-2027478.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078046S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5238716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5238716","articleId":"5238770","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"}]
