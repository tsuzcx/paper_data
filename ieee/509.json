For uplink scheduling without fairness consideration, we propose two Lagrangian duality optimization-based methods to maximize the weighted sum rate, which include a cyclic dual-update algorithm and a per-stage dual-update algorithm. For a low-complexity alternative, we design and analyze the transmit power and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) product (PSP) based selective multiuser diversity (SMuD) schemes. Next, for fair scheduling, we propose rate maximization schemes under access proportional fairness (APF) and rate proportional fairness (RPF) constraints, respectively. The APF is achieved using normalized channel SNR (n-SNR) ranking-based SMuD for user selection per carrier, and the RPF is realized using dynamical carrier assignment based on the target rate ratios. Analytical throughput and fairness metrics are derived and verified via simulations. Numerical results illustrate the sum rate loss caused by rate fairness and access fairness constraints compared to the duality approach. Also, we show that unlike the downlink case, for uplink OFDMA the correlated frequency channels (carriers) cause significant ergodic sum rate degradation compared to the independent channels. These results provide new insight into the achievable uplink OFDMA performance with and without fairness constraints.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080866","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5089942/05090000.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089942","startPage":"3193","endPage":"3205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate-maximization scheduling schemes for uplink OFDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Rate-maximization scheduling schemes for uplink OFDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090000/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10731357","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5090000/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate-maximization scheduling schemes for uplink OFDMA","sourcePdf":"3193-tw0906-ma.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078653S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5089942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5089942","articleId":"5090000","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5090002,"authors":[{"name":"Narayan Prasad","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5089942/5090002/5090002-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Narayan Prasad received the B.

In this scheme, each data symbol is spread over many tones by a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) operation at the transmitter before being sent to the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulator. Moreover, more than one user can be scheduled over the same frequency and time resource block (RB) via space-division multiple-access (SDMA). The conventional receiver technique for such DFT-spread OFDM systems involves tone-by-tone single-tap equalization followed by an inverse DFT operation. In this paper, we propose a more powerful receiver technique for DFT-spread OFDM systems that consists of an efficient linear pre-filter and a two-symbol soft output demodulator. The proposed method can be applied to both single-user per RB (DFT-S-OFDMA) and multiple users per RB (DFT-S-OFDMSDMA) systems and it offers significant performance gains over the conventional method, especially in the high-rate regime, with little attendant increase in computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080941","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5089942/05090002.pdf","startPage":"3216","endPage":"3225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080941","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient receiver algorithms for DFT-spread OFDM systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090002/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Efficient receiver algorithms for DFT-spread OFDM systems","volume":"8","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10721247","htmlLink":"/document/5090002/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient receiver algorithms for DFT-spread OFDM systems","sourcePdf":"3216-tw0906-prasad.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064376S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5089942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5089942","articleId":"5090002","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5090005,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5089942/5090005/5090005-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dan Wang was born in Liaoning province, China, in 1979.

We first give two ways to construct the samples of noise variance using the least square (LS) channel estimates, by which we model the estimation problem of noise variance as parameter estimation of an exponential distribution and turn the NBI detection in the LS channel estimates into a general constant false alarm rate (CFAR) problem. Then, a robust noise variance estimator based on order statistic is presented to avoid the impact of NBI, and its estimation variance is also analyzed. In addition, a low complexity robust channel estimation (RCE) scheme is provided without requiring any knowledge of channel statistics including finite delay spread. The RCE scheme includes three new steps, namely the identification of the NBI signal by a CFAR detector, the recovery of channel estimates at the jammed frequency bins by either utilizing the conjugate symmetry property of the UWB channel or median filtering, and finally noise reduction through threshold filtering. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed schemes compared to the existing methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5089942/05090005.pdf","startPage":"3249","endPage":"3259","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.081015","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.081015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089942","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090005","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust noise variance and channel estimation for SC-FDE UWB systems under narrowband interference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise robustness","Channel estimation","Narrowband","Interference","Frequency estimation","Filtering","Least squares approximation","Parameter estimation","Exponential distribution","Statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","equalisers","exponential distribution","frequency-domain analysis","least squares approximations","median filters","radiofrequency interference","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust noise variance estimation","channel estimation","SC-FDE UWB system","frequency-domain equalization","narrowband interference","least square channel estimate","parameter estimation","exponential distribution","constant false alarm rate problem","channel statistics","finite delay spread","median filtering","threshold filtering","noise reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation, noise variance, robust estimation, order statistic, narrowband interference (NBI), ultrawideband (UWB)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090005/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Robust noise variance and channel estimation for SC-FDE UWB systems under narrowband interference","volume":"8","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5090005/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10731360","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust noise variance and channel estimation for SC-FDE UWB systems under narrowband interference","sourcePdf":"3249-tw0906-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.290134S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5089942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5089942","articleId":"5090005","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5090006,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandre Graell i Amat","affiliation":["Electronics Department, IT/Telecom Bretagne, Brest, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5089942/5090006/5090006-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alexandre Graell i Amat was born in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, on January 28, 1976.

A three-step design procedure is proposed to optimize the association of the outer code and the CPM for a wide range of spectral efficiencies, ranging from 0.75 to 2.25 bit/s/Hz. Firstly, EXIT chart analysis is applied to derive general guidelines for choosing SCCPM parameters. A significant result is that a high-rate outer code is required to achieve good convergence threshold, given a spectral efficiency. At a second stage, union bounds to the error probability are considered to choose the outer code under the constraints arising from the EXIT charts analysis. From this analysis, extended BCH codes and extended Hamming codes are proposed as outer code for broadband and narrowband transmission, respectively. For the latter, double-binary convolutional codes and symbol interleaving is also proposed as a valid alternative. Finally, combining both EXIT charts and union bounds we optimize the association of code and CPM to achieve both low error rates and good convergence. The proposed concatenated structure offers very low error floors and good performance in the waterfall region for all considered spectral efficiencies. A significant improvement with respect to previous concatenated CPM schemes is shown.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.081051","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5089942/05090006.pdf","startPage":"3260","endPage":"3269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.081051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Serially concatenated continuous phase modulation for satellite communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Serially concatenated continuous phase modulation for satellite communications","volume":"8","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10731361","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5090006/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090006/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Serially concatenated continuous phase modulation for satellite communications","sourcePdf":"3260-tw0906-amat.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057713S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5089942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5089942","articleId":"5090006","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5090008,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Brooklyn, Canada","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 6 MetroTech Center, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5089942/5090008/5090008-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xi Liu received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2006 and the M.A.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2008.

Unlike traditional fixed-rate codes, fountain codes are capable of adapting the bit rate to the channel realization blindly, i.e., without channel information at the transmitter. This makes them attractive in fading wireless channels. We first describe several rateless cooperative protocols, and then implement them using Raptor codes (a type of fountain code) and 16-QAM over a slow, deeply-interleaved fading relay channel. Given no delay constraints, the achievable rate of these protocols are found when the source and relay are close to each other, and when the relay is half-way between the source and destination. Furthermore, to reduce decoding complexity, we propose a soft-decision version of the adaptive demodulation (ADM) method recently introduced in the literature at each receiver. Finally, we analyze the practical scenario of data streaming with delay constraints, and find that the time-division (TD) protocol retains its relative superiority over the space-time one.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.081102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.081102","startPage":"3278","endPage":"3287","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5089942/05090008.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fountain codes over fading relay channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Fountain codes over fading relay channels","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","volume":"8","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5090008/","accessionNumber":"10731362","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090008/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fountain codes over fading relay channels","sourcePdf":"3278-tw0906-liu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074239S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5089942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"5089942","articleId":"5090008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-21"},{"_id":5090010,"authors":[{"name":"Sudharman K.

In this paper, on the other hand, we develop a framework for dynamic spectrum leasing (DSL). Power control in hierarchical DSA networks only involves that of controlling secondary user transmissions. Thus, in game theoretic formulations of power control in cognitive DSA networks only secondary users are considered as players of the game. In proposed dynamic spectrum leasing, on the other hand, the primary users are rewarded for allowing secondary users to operate in their licensed spectrum. Thus, in the proposed DSL networks the primary users have an incentive to allow secondary users to access the spectrum whenever possible to the maximum extent. We develop a game theoretic framework for such dynamic spectrum leasing in which primary users actively participate in a non-cooperative game with secondary users by selecting an interference cap on the total interference they willing to tolerate. We establish that the proposed primary-secondary user power control game has a unique Nash equilibrium. Performance of a DSL system based on the proposed game model is compared through simulations under different linear receivers at the secondary base station.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic spectrum leasing in cognitive radio networks via primary-secondary user power control games","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.081230","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5089942/05090010.pdf","startPage":"3300","endPage":"3310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.081230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089942","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090010","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090010/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic spectrum leasing in cognitive radio networks via primary-secondary user power control games","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5090010/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10721250","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic spectrum leasing in cognitive radio networks via primary-secondary user power control games","sourcePdf":"3300-tw0906-jayaweera.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118965S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5089942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"141","xplore-issue":"5089942","articleId":"5090010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5090038,"authors":[{"name":"Giovanni Capobianco","affiliation":["STAT, University of Molise, Pesche, Isernia, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Capobianco","id":"37680169000"},{"name":"Andrea De Lucia","affiliation":["DMI, University of Salerno, Fisciano, Salerno, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"De Lucia","id":"37265266000"},{"name":"Rocco Oliveto","affiliation":["DMI, University of Salerno, Fisciano, Salerno, Italy"],"firstName":"Rocco","lastName":"Oliveto","id":"37265274900"},{"name":"Annibale Panichella","affiliation":["STAT, University of Molise, Pesche, Isernia, Italy"],"firstName":"Annibale","lastName":"Panichella","id":"37680168600"},{"name":"Sebastiano Panichella","affiliation":["STAT, University of Molise, Pesche, Isernia, Italy"],"firstName":"Sebastiano","lastName":"Panichella","id":"37680168800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3998-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3997-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-8138"}],"articleNumber":"5090038","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":463},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexing","Humans","Information retrieval","Software maintenance","Natural languages","Information management","Software engineering","Engineering management","Information analysis","Computer errors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indexing","information retrieval","software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IR-based traceability recovery","information retrieval techniques","artefact indexing","software documents","vector space","software engineering community"]}],"abstract":"The intensive human effort needed to manually manage traceability information has increased the interest in utilising semi-automated traceability recovery techniques. This paper presents a simple way to improve the accuracy of traceability recovery methods based on information retrieval techniques. The proposed method acts on the artefact indexing considering only the nouns contained in the artefact content to define the semantics of an artefact. The rationale behind such a choice is that the language used in software documents can be classified as a sectorial language, where the terms that provide more indication on the semantics of a document are the nouns. The results of a reported case study demonstrate that the proposed artefact indexing significantly improves the accuracy of traceability recovery methods based on the probabilistic or vector space based IR models.","doi":"10.1109/ICPC.2009.5090038","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 17th International Conference on Program Comprehension","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 17th International Conference on Program Comprehension","pdfPath":"/iel5/5073941/5090011/05090038.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPC.2009.5090038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090011","startPage":"148","endPage":"157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the role of the nouns in IR-based traceability recovery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090038","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the role of the nouns in IR-based traceability recovery","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090038/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10719421","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5090038/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the role of the nouns in IR-based traceability recovery","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.153375S","chronDate":"17-19 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5073941","isNumber":"5090011","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5073941","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5090011","articleId":"5090038","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5090089,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Enteshari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Enteshari","id":"37563008800"},{"name":"Mohsen Kavehrad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Kavehrad","id":"37268175500"},{"name":"Jarir Fadlullah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jarir","lastName":"Fadlullah","id":"37393109900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3509-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3508-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"5090089","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Copper","Wiring","Modulation coding","Convolutional codes","Parity check codes","Demodulation","Communication cables","Ethernet networks","CMOS technology","Constellation diagram"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulation","modulation coding","parity check codes","wires (electric)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal construction","high-speed access","copper wiring","coded modulation","coded demodulation","data transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coded modulation","Margin","LDPC"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090089","abstract":"In this paper, we present signal construction for the future IEEE 40GBASE-T standard.

A new adaptive parameter called spacetime symbol rate is applied in our design. We have studied the statistics of signal-to-interference-noise of a linear MMSE receiver over a Rayleigh fading channel. The average BER for a given constellation using the MMSE receiver is calculated numerically. With the statistics as a guideline, two adaptive techniques using constellation and space-time symbol rate are studied, respectively. If constellation and space-time symbol rate are considered jointly, more selection modes can be available. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the average transmission rate of the joint adaptation can be improved in this case.

There are many radio and network parameters that may be adapted in response to changes in the environment, and these may interact resulting in an emergent state that is not predictable by considering the parameters separately. The cognitive radio network may therefore be considered as a complex adaptive system; further, multiple independent networks form a complex system of systems. Thus, the evaluation of mobile networks operating in congested, heterogeneous environments must consider the high-level objectives rather than those of individual radio and network components.

An input-queued (IQ) crossbar switch includes a set of queues at the input side of the switch, combined with an unbuffered switching matrix with N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n crosspoints. A crosspoint-queued (XQ) crossbar switch contains a FIFO queue at each of the NxN crosspoints of the switching matrix. Switches with combined IQs and XQs, denoted CIXQ, have been the subject of considerable research over the last decade. The use of crosspoint queues simplifies the scheduling of traffic through the switch, at the cost of adding O(N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n)FIFO queues to the switching matrix. In this paper, a power analysis of IQ and CIXQ switches is presented, assuming an FPGA implementation. The basic switch design consists of a demultiplexer network associated with each row of the switching matrix, and a multiplexer network associated with each column of the matrix. An accurate power analysis for these switches in an FPGA environment is presented. Analysis indicates that the internal FIFO queues in a CIXQ switch roughly triple the power required in an FPGA implementation.

For this reason, the switching rate is an important parameter in selection diversity system design. Yet, there are few published results regarding the switching rates of selection diversity combining. All published work considers noiseless diversity systems; no results for switching rates of selection diversity in systems with noise exist. The switching rates of dual selection diversity combining in Rayleigh and Rician fading are examined in a noisy environment. Analytical expressions are derived for independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and independent and non-identically distributed (i.n.d.) fading channels. The switching rates in the presence of noise are compared to those in noise-free cases. It is seen that, in the presence of noise, the receiver filtering can greatly influence the switching rate.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2009.5090140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2009.5090140","publicationTitle":"2009 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5075165/5090078/05090140.pdf","startPage":"293","endPage":"297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The impact of noise on switching rates in dual selection combining diversity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"The impact of noise on switching rates in dual selection combining diversity","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5090140/","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10719568","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090140/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The impact of noise on switching rates in dual selection combining diversity","confLoc":"St. John's, NL, Canada","sourcePdf":"1569174683.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085154S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5075165","isNumber":"5090078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5075165","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5090078","articleId":"5090140","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5090142,"authors":[{"name":"Linan Sun","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Linan Sun","id":"37087295405"},{"name":"Zhongzhao Zhang","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Zhongzhao Zhang","id":"37087192231"},{"name":"Xuejun Sha","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Xuejun Sha","id":"37087294702"},{"name":"Jingning Wang","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Jingning Wang","id":"37087612223"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3509-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3508-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"5090142","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"abstract":"User cooperative communication can bring spatial diversity, and improve cell boundary uplink quality.

Wireless networking has expanded array design possibilities to include wirelessly connected elements; however, static positioning of elements remains central to determination and application of weights necessary for coherent array beam formation. Wireless networks allow for participant mobility, but applied weights must be reformed for each position update in order to maintain target focus. While deterministic motion allows easy weight translation, random element motion requires significant network energy to reform weights through position updates. The relationship between array factor and stochastic element motion is analyzed. A relationship is developed between motion and array factor magnitude probability towards the intended target vector. The relationship proposed is shown to be assessable and useful for reducing network traffic and processing overhead and while producing operationally acceptable gain towards the target. The result compares favorably against a constant position updating model in terms of sensor energy usage across the network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090146/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10719592","publicationDate":"May 2009","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5090146/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sensor beamforming with distributed mobile elements in a wireless sensor network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensor beamforming with distributed mobile elements in a wireless sensor network","confLoc":"St. John's, NL, Canada","sourcePdf":"1569176801.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072304S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5075165","isNumber":"5090078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5075165","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5090078","articleId":"5090146","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5090154,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Nasri","affiliation":["University of British Columbia, Canada"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Nasri","id":"37295771100"},{"name":"Robert Schober","affiliation":["University of British Columbia, Canada"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Schober","id":"37281221400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3509-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3508-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"5090154","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chromium","Noise robustness","Bit error rate","Cognitive radio","Narrowband","Interchannel interference","Interleaved codes","Modulation coding","OFDM modulation","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","error statistics","Gaussian distribution","Gaussian noise","interleaved codes","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio systems","frequency spectrum","under-utilized frequency bands","nonGaussian distributions","cochannel interference","man-made impulsive noise","nonGaussian noise","nonGaussian interference","bit-interleaved coded modulation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","asymptotic closed-form approximation","bit error rate","BER","Lp-norm metric"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radio (CR) systems make efficient use of the frequency spectrum by opportunistically exploiting unoccupied or under-utilized frequency bands.

This suggests that the proposed system is more robust to multiple access interference (MAI) as compared to that with MMSE.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2009.5090165","publicationTitle":"2009 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5075165/5090078/05090165.pdf","startPage":"411","endPage":"414","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2009.5090165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error performance of 8-QAM trellis-coded MC-CDMA with controlled equalization over wireless channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090165","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090165/","displayDocTitle":"Error performance of 8-QAM trellis-coded MC-CDMA with controlled equalization over wireless channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10719593","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5090165/","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error performance of 8-QAM trellis-coded MC-CDMA with controlled equalization over wireless channels","confLoc":"St. John's, NL, Canada","sourcePdf":"1569175297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054726S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5075165","isNumber":"5090078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5075165","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5090078","articleId":"5090165","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5090170,"authors":[{"name":"Xun Tang","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xun","lastName":"Tang","id":"37599151400"},{"name":"Xue-jun Sha","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xue-jun","lastName":"Sha","id":"37294263700"},{"name":"Rong-hui Wen","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Rong-hui","lastName":"Wen","id":"37587847000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3509-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3508-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"5090170","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Search methods","Spread spectrum communication","Fourier transforms","Chirp","Delay effects","Delay estimation","Filtering algorithms","Bandwidth","Multiple signal classification","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","signal processing","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subchip multipath search","DSSS system","fractional Fourier transform","chirp signal","multipath chirps"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Subchip Multipath Search","Fractional Fourier Transform","Chirp signal"]}],"abstract":"A subchip multipath search method for DSSS system based on fractional Fourier transform(FrFT) is proposed.

Omnidirectional and perspective camera technologies are integrated to create a robust vision system that combines the strengths of both camera types. A compact, inexpensive and highly modular design is presented in which system modules are stacked vertically. The vertical structure provides each module with an unobstructed 360 degree horizontal view of the surroundings and allows the omnidirectional cameras to directly guide an active camera to view a target point. The physical system design is detailed, along with a description of the system's hardware and software architectures. The hardware architecture is scalable and fully self contained, while the software architecture is built around a user datagram protocol (UDP) network, allowing the computational load to be distributed over multiple computers.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer

We investigate three schemes exploiting spatial diversity including multiple-relay cooperation (MR-Coop), conventional multiple-relay relaying (MR-Relay), and multiple-input-single-output (MISO). The total power is equally allocated to transmission partners without the knowledge of CSIT. Moreover it is practical for relays to decide whether or not to assist transmission with the knowledge of channel state information at receiver (CSIR). We then deal with a typical path loss exponent of 3, present the corresponding computational methods for outage probability. This method is based on characteristic coefficient, which is simpler than the existing methods which are based on calculating probability density function. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the validity of our analysis, and also show the cooperative scheme can effectively exploit multiple-channel diversity and path loss saving to combat the fading.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2009.5090199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090078","publicationTitle":"2009 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5075165/5090078/05090199.pdf","endPage":"597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A computational method for outage probability exploiting spatial diversity without channel state information at transmitter","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2009.5090199","startPage":"593","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090199","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A computational method for outage probability exploiting spatial diversity without channel state information at transmitter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090199/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10719627","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5090199/","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A computational method for outage probability exploiting spatial diversity without channel state information at transmitter","confLoc":"St. John's, NL","sourcePdf":"1569176207.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049183S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5075165","isNumber":"5090078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5075165","xplore-issue":"5090078","articleId":"5090199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":5090226,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Higuchi","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Royal Military College of Canada, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Higuchi","id":"37928118200"},{"name":"Francois Chan","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Royal Military College of Canada, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Francois","lastName":"Chan","id":"37273444700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3509-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3508-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"5090226","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved V-BLAST symbol detection using short block codes","abstract":"We present a new iterative symbol detection and decoding scheme for coded V-BLAST architectures (ISDD-BLAST).

Hence, the scheme can achieve high capacity. The capacities of water-filling, equal power, beamforming and beam-nulling are compared through theoretical analysis and numerical results. It is shown that at medium signal-to-noise ratio, beam-nulling approaches the optimal waterfilling scheme. Additionally, the existing beamforming and new proposed beam-nulling can be extended if more than one eigenvector is available at the transmitter.

In the literature, there are several OFDMA scheduling algorithms such as the Hungarian and Max-Max algorithm. However, such algorithms do not consider the multiuser diversity into account. In this paper, we propose a scheduling algorithm that exploits the multiuser diversity in both time and frequency domains. Also, the proposed algorithm utilizes the Proportional Fairness (PF) criterion to achieve fairness among users in the system. In order to support multimedia bursty traffic, our algorithm allows more than one user to share a subband in each time frame. The proposed algorithm iteratively assigns the available subbands to be shared among different users concurrently. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with other OFDMA scheduling algorithms in the literature. Results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other algorithms in terms of the throughput with comparable fairness performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-time scheduling algorithm for OFDMA systems","publicationTitle":"2009 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2009.5090232","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5075165/5090078/05090232.pdf","startPage":"766","endPage":"771","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2009.5090232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090078","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090232","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090232/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-time scheduling algorithm for OFDMA systems","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5090232/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10719660","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-time scheduling algorithm for OFDMA systems","confLoc":"St. John's, NL, Canada","sourcePdf":"1569177343.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062854S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5075165","isNumber":"5090078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5075165","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5090078","articleId":"5090232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5090233,"authors":[{"name":"Viet-Ha Pham","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Universit\u00e9 Laval, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Viet-Ha","lastName":"Pham","id":"37408882900"},{"name":"Jean-Yves Chouinard","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Universit\u00e9 Laval, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Jean-Yves","lastName":"Chouinard","id":"37274195300"},{"name":"Assia Semmar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Universit\u00e9 Laval, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Assia","lastName":"Semmar","id":"37267287200"},{"name":"Xianbin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Western Ontario, London, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Xianbin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281394100"},{"name":"Yiyan Wu","affiliation":["Communications Rcscarch Centre, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Yiyan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281231400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3509-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3508-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"5090233","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":140},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced ATSC DTV channel estimation","abstract":"ATSC standard is the digital television (DTV) standard in the North America and was developed by the Advanced Television Systems Committee.

Off-line path planning is performed on a 5DOF robot arm to confirm the validity of the approach.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2009.5090243","publicationTitle":"2009 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5075165/5090078/05090243.pdf","startPage":"823","endPage":"826","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2009.5090243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling-based path planning for robust feature-based visual servoing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Sampling-based path planning for robust feature-based visual servoing","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5090243/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10719671","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090243/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling-based path planning for robust feature-based visual servoing","confLoc":"St. John's, NL, Canada","sourcePdf":"1569175437.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039046S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5075165","isNumber":"5090078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5075165","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5090078","articleId":"5090243","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5090249,"authors":[{"name":"Jing-ning Wang","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Jing-ning Wang","id":"37087677192"},{"name":"Xue-jun Sha","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Xue-jun Sha","id":"37087676600"},{"name":"Wei-dang Lu","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Wei-dang Lu","id":"37087677089"},{"name":"Zhong-zhao Zhang","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Zhong-zhao Zhang","id":"37087504773"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3509-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3508-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"5090249","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Diversity methods","Decoding","Antenna arrays","Transmitting antennas","Protocols","Bandwidth","MIMO","Fading","Broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cellular radio","diversity reception","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partner selection strategy","cooperative diversity systems","virtual antenna arrays","spatial diversity gains","handoff times","wireless channel","radio cell"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative diversity","partner selection","users with high speed","grouping users"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090249","abstract":"Cooperative diversity has been adopted to form virtual antenna arrays in order to obtain spatial diversity gains.

By using chirp signals with different frequency band widths as carriers at the transmitter, the received signal is transformed into corresponding FrFT domain, then the narrow band matching coherent demodulation is used.

The particle swarm uses simple operators and is a bottom-up approach for identifying the location in a 2D space. Hence the PSO uses less energy. For comparison we present two alternative approaches traditionally used for this problem. The first one is (a) traditional iterative least square algorithm, (b) a one step simple least square solution. With respect to least squares, PSO results in slightly less error than the traditional iterative least square approach making. However, it is computationally inexpensive making it a good choice for a wireless network of small devices. The PSO multilateration algorithm really improves localization error over the one step least square algorithm. The new algorithm can replace the traditional algorithm in different applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090268/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10719694","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5090268/","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A particle swarm optimization based multilateration algorithm for UWB sensor network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A particle swarm optimization based multilateration algorithm for UWB sensor network","confLoc":"St. John's, NL, Canada","sourcePdf":"1569201933.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054504S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5075165","isNumber":"5090078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5075165","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5090078","articleId":"5090268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5090269,"authors":[{"name":"Rui He","affiliation":["Faculty of engineering and applied science, Memorial University of Newfoundland and Labrador, Saint John's, Canada"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"He","id":"37396895000"},{"name":"Lihong Zhang","affiliation":["Faculty of engineering and applied science, Memorial University of Newfoundland and Labrador, Saint John's, Canada"],"firstName":"Lihong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280170400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3509-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3508-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"5090269","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":125},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090269","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a method using mean-field neural networks to solve the placement problem for the layout design of analog integrated circuits.

Parametric study demonstrated that while the optimal value of alpha results in high efficiency over a reduced power range, a judicious sub-optimal choice of the design parameter will lower the peak average efficiency but considerably increase the high efficiency power range of the Doherty amplifier.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficiency optimization of WCDMA driven two-way Doherty power amplifiers over wide power range","publicationTitle":"2009 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2009.5090319","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5075165/5090078/05090319.pdf","startPage":"1217","endPage":"1220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2009.5090319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090078","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090319","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090319/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Efficiency optimization of WCDMA driven two-way Doherty power amplifiers over wide power range","conferenceDate":"3-6 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5090319/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10719507","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficiency optimization of WCDMA driven two-way Doherty power amplifiers over wide power range","confLoc":"St. John's, NL, Canada","sourcePdf":"1569174945.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062953S","chronDate":"3-6 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5075165","isNumber":"5090078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5075165","xplore-issue":"5090078","articleId":"5090319","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5090331,"authors":[{"name":"Dae Hyun Kim","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Dae Hyun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085500936"},{"name":"Saibal Mukhopadhyay","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Saibal","lastName":"Mukhopadhyay","id":"37278557500"},{"name":"Sung Kyu Lim","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Sung Kyu","lastName":"Lim","id":"37280563100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4492-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4493-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2380-632X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-6338"}],"articleNumber":"5090331","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":775},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090331","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Through-silicon vias","Wires","Parasitic capacitance","Energy consumption","Heat sinks","Bonding","Predictive models","Delay","Silicon","Sockets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitance","integrated circuit interconnections","integrated circuit modelling","logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TSV-aware interconnect length","power prediction","3D stacked IC","3D wirelength distribution","through-silicon-via","logic gates","parasitic capacitance"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IITC.2009.5090331","pdfPath":"/iel5/5069981/5090321/05090331.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Interconnect Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Interconnect Technology Conference","startPage":"26","endPage":"28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090321","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IITC.2009.5090331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TSV-aware interconnect length and power prediction for 3D stacked ICs","abstract":"In this paper, we present a new 3D wirelength distribution model which considers the contribution of through-silicon-via (TSV) on wirelength, die area, and power consumption. Since TSVs occupy the device layer together with active devices, the die area increases if TSVs are utilized. This area overhead, which in turn affects the wirelength, worsens due to the large size of TSVs themselves, which is shown to be as large as logic gates themselves. Moreover, the capacitive coupling among TSVs and wires cause non-negligible amount of parasitic capacitance, which worsens power consumption.

Simulation results indicate the NBS resource sharing is fair in that the degree of cooperation of a node only depends on how much contribution its partner can make to its SNR increase.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/5090404/05090410.pdf","startPage":"381","endPage":"383","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2009.081822","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2009.081822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090404","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fair resource sharing for cooperative relay networks using nash bargaining solutions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090410/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Fair resource sharing for cooperative relay networks using nash bargaining solutions","htmlLink":"/document/5090410/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10731328","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fair resource sharing for cooperative relay networks using nash bargaining solutions","sourcePdf":"0381-cl0906-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052953S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"5090404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5090404","articleId":"5090410","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5090413,"authors":[{"name":"Redha M.

Such information can be expected to be highly structured allowing it to be compressed, but the computational burden of conventional compression techniques exclude their use in this environment. We consider the use of new mathematical techniques that allow a signal to be compressed and recovered from a relatively small number of samples. These techniques, collectively termed compressive sampling, are asymmetric in that compression is simple, but recovery is complex. This makes them appropriate for applications in which the simplicity of the sensor can be offset against complexity at the ultimate recipient of the sensed information. We evaluate the practicality of using such techniques in the transfer of signals representing one or more micro-architectural counters from a processor core. We show that compressive sampling is usable to recover such performance signals, evaluating the trade-off between efficiency, accuracy and practicability within its various variants.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECCS.2009.13","publicationTitle":"2009 14th IEEE International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 14th IEEE International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5090495/5090496/05090529.pdf","startPage":"210","endPage":"219","doi":"10.1109/ICECCS.2009.13","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Applicability of Compressive Sampling in Fine Grained Processor Performance Monitoring","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"On the Applicability of Compressive Sampling in Fine Grained Processor Performance Monitoring","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5090529/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10730672","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090529/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Applicability of Compressive Sampling in Fine Grained Processor Performance Monitoring","confLoc":"Potsdam, Germany","sourcePdf":"3702a210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049251S","chronDate":"2-4 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5090495","isNumber":"5090496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5090495","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5090496","articleId":"5090529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5090574,"authors":[{"name":"Hsin-Heng Wang","affiliation":["Powerchip Semiconductor Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsin-Heng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37934601600"},{"name":"Pei-Shan Shieh","affiliation":["Powerchip Semiconductor Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pei-Shan","lastName":"Shieh","id":"37939052100"},{"name":"Chiu-Tsung Huang","affiliation":["Powerchip Semiconductor Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chiu-Tsung","lastName":"Huang","id":"38184593000"},{"name":"Kenji Tokami","affiliation":["Powerchip Semiconductor Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kenji","lastName":"Tokami","id":"37294023000"},{"name":"Ricky Kuo","affiliation":["Powerchip Semiconductor Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ricky","lastName":"Kuo","id":"37943243000"},{"name":"Shin-Hsien Chen","affiliation":["Powerchip Semiconductor Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shin-Hsien","lastName":"Chen","id":"38179948700"},{"name":"Houng-Chi Wei","affiliation":["Powerchip Semiconductor Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Houng-Chi","lastName":"Wei","id":"37579350200"},{"name":"Saysamone Pittikoun","affiliation":["Powerchip Semiconductor Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Saysamone","lastName":"Pittikoun","id":"37569586300"},{"name":"Seiichi Aritome","affiliation":["Powerchip Semiconductor Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Seiichi","lastName":"Aritome","id":"37352316400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3762-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-483X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-4864"}],"articleNumber":"5090574","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":1152},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090574","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Failure analysis","Boosting","Hot carrier injection","Voltage","Electrons","Current density","Impact ionization","Electrostatic measurements","Performance evaluation","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories","hot carriers","multivalued logic circuits","NAND circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["read-disturb failure mechanism","hot-carrier injection boosting effect","MLC NAND flash memory","WLn cells Vth shift","unselected cell area"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we have reported a new failure phenomenon of read-disturb in MLC NAND flash memory caused by boosting hot-carrier injection effect.

Due to the relatively large EOT (>15 nm) compared to the device dimension (F), the most severe interference comes from adjacent pass-gate WL bias disturb through the edge fringing field effect. On the other hand, the program charges in adjacent devices generate only minor interference effect (<200 mV) down to 25 nm node. Low-K spacer between WL's is very effective in suppressing the pass-gate interference due to the suppressed fringing field effect. For the first time we propose that low-K spacer can improve the short-channel effect as well as program/erase characteristics. The physical reason is that low-K spacer can confine the electrical field inside the channel thus improve the device performances. By suitably engineering the low-K spacer, p-well/junction and EOT we suggest that scaling of CT NAND Flash beyond 15 nm is quite feasible.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090576/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 May 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10730703","htmlLink":"/document/5090576/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Study of Stored Charge Interference and Fringing Field Effects in Sub-30nm Charge-Trapping NAND Flash","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study of Stored Charge Interference and Fringing Field Effects in Sub-30nm Charge-Trapping NAND Flash","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"02-02-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054362S","chronDate":"10-14 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5090563","isNumber":"5090564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5090563","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5090564","articleId":"5090576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5090577,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Reset current densities of GST and GeTe are comparable, while GeTe data-retention at high- temperature is significantly improved compared to GST, suggesting that GeTe-based compounds are promising candidates for embedded PC memory applications.","doi":"10.1109/IMW.2009.5090585","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Memory Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Memory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/5090563/5090564/05090585.pdf","endPage":"2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMW.2009.5090585","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090585/","displayDocTitle":"Comparative Assessment of GST and GeTe Materials for Application to Embedded Phase-Change Memory Devices","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5090585/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10730712","publicationDate":"May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative Assessment of GST and GeTe Materials for Application to Embedded Phase-Change Memory Devices","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"03-02-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045669S","chronDate":"10-14 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5090563","isNumber":"5090564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5090563","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5090564","articleId":"5090585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5090586,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Networks-on-chip (NoCs) can improve the on-chip communication bandwidth of MPSoCs. However, traditional metallic interconnects consume significant amount of power to deliver even higher communication bandwidth required in the near future. Optical NoCs are based on CMOS-compatible optical waveguides and microresonators, and promise significant bandwidth and power advantages. This paper proposes a fat tree-based optical NoC (FONoC) including its topology, floorplan, protocols, and a low-power and low-cost optical router, optical turnaround router (OTAR). Different from other optical NoCs, FONoC does not require building a separate electronic NoC for network control. It carries both payload data and network control data on the same optical network, while using circuit switching for the former and packet switching for the latter. The FONoC protocols are designed to minimize network control data and the related power consumption. An optimized turnaround routing algorithm is designed to utilize the low-power feature of OTAR, which can passively route packets without powering on any microresonator in 40% of all cases. Comparing with other optical routers, OTAR has the lowest optical power loss and uses the lowest number of microresonators. An analytical model is developed to characterize the power consumption of FONoC. We compare the power consumption of FONoC with a matched electronic NoC in 45 nm, and show that FONoC can save 87% power comparing with the electronic NoC on a 64-core MPSoC. We simulate the FONoC for the 64-core MPSoC and show the end-to-end delay and network throughput under different offered loads and packet sizes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-power fat tree-based optical Network-On-Chip for multiprocessor system-on-chip","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090624","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090624.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090624","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090624/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A low-power fat tree-based optical Network-On-Chip for multiprocessor system-on-chip","conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5090624/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10730338","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-power fat tree-based optical Network-On-Chip for multiprocessor system-on-chip","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"02.2_1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071134S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090624","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5090625,"authors":[{"name":"Ciprian Seiculescu","affiliation":["LSI, EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Ciprian","lastName":"Seiculescu","id":"37391635700"},{"name":"Srinivasan Murali","affiliation":["INoCs, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Srinivasan","lastName":"Murali","id":"37274207100"},{"name":"Luca Benini","affiliation":["DEIS, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Benini","id":"37274443600"},{"name":"Giovanni De Micheli","affiliation":["LSI, EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"De Micheli","id":"37274174300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3781-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-9810-8015-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1591"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1101"}],"articleNumber":"5090625","dbTime":"41 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":73,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":383},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network-on-a-chip","Network topology","Network synthesis","System-on-a-chip","Integrated circuit interconnections","Delay","Circuit topology","Integrated circuit synthesis","Three-dimensional integrated circuits","Integrated circuit technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","integrated circuit interconnections","network topology","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SunFloor 3D","networks on chip topology synthesis","3D systems on chip","three-dimensional integrated circuits","NoC interconnect","3D technology","application-specific NoC","NoC topology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D ICs","Networks on chip (NoC)","synthesis","topology","placement"]}],"abstract":"Three-dimensional integrated circuits are a promising approach to address the integration challenges faced by current Systems on Chips (SoCs). Designing an efficient Network on Chip (NoC) interconnect for a 3D SoC that not only meets the application performance constraints, but also the constraints imposed by the 3D technology, is a significant challenge. In this work we present a design tool, SunFloor 3D, to synthesize application-specific 3D NoCs. The proposed tool determines the best NoC topology for the application, finds paths for the communication flows, assigns the network components on to the 3D layers and performs a placement of them in each layer. We perform experiments on several SoC benchmarks and present a comparative study between 3D and 2D NoC designs. Our studies show large improvements in interconnect power consumption (average of 38%) and delay (average of 13%) for the 3D NoC when compared to the corresponding 2D implementation. Our studies also show that the synthesized topologies result in large power (average of 54%) and delay savings (average of 21%) when compared to standard topologies.","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090625","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090625.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"14","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SunFloor 3D: A tool for Networks On Chip topology synthesis for 3D systems on chips","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090625","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090625/","displayDocTitle":"SunFloor 3D: A tool for Networks On Chip topology synthesis for 3D systems on chips","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10757797","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5090625/","conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SunFloor 3D: A tool for Networks On Chip topology synthesis for 3D systems on chips","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"02.2_2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.142937S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5090627,"authors":[{"name":"David Fick","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Fick","id":"37888718600"},{"name":"Andrew DeOrio","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"DeOrio","id":"37541614700"},{"name":"Gregory Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Gregory","lastName":"Chen","id":"37536179800"},{"name":"Valeria Bertacco","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Valeria","lastName":"Bertacco","id":"37267142300"},{"name":"Dennis Sylvester","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Dennis","lastName":"Sylvester","id":"37274874600"},{"name":"David Blaauw","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Blaauw","id":"37276099100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3781-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-9810-8015-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1591"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1101"}],"articleNumber":"5090627","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":139,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":777},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Fault tolerance","Network-on-a-chip","Hardware","System-on-a-chip","Maintenance","Joining processes","Fault tolerant systems","Monte Carlo methods","Computer network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit reliability","fault tolerance","interconnections","network routing","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["routing algorithm","fault-tolerant NoCs","foreshadow worsening transistor reliability","systems-on-chip","chip multiprocessor","device failure","network-on-chip","interconnect networks","2D-mesh networks","2D-torus networks"]}],"abstract":"Current trends in technology scaling foreshadow worsening transistor reliability as well as greater numbers of transistors in each system. The combination of these factors will soon make long-term product reliability extremely difficult in complex modern systems such as systems on a chip (SoC) and chip multiprocessor (CMP) designs, where even a single device failure can cause fatal system errors. Resiliency to device failure will be a necessary condition at future technology nodes. In this work, we present a network-on-chip (NoC) routing algorithm to boost the robustness in interconnect networks, by reconfiguring them to avoid faulty components while maintaining connectivity and correct operation. This distributed algorithm can be implemented in hardware with less than 300 gates per network router. Experimental results over a broad range of 2D-mesh and 2D-torus networks demonstrate 99.99% reliability on average when 10% of the interconnect links have failed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A highly resilient routing algorithm for fault-tolerant NoCs","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090627","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090627.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"26","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090627","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090627","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090627/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A highly resilient routing algorithm for fault-tolerant NoCs","conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5090627/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10757798","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A highly resilient routing algorithm for fault-tolerant NoCs","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"02.2_4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069986S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5090628,"authors":[{"name":"Sean Whitty","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communication Network Engineering, Technical University of Braunschweig, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Sean","lastName":"Whitty","id":"37391928200"},{"name":"Henning Sahlbach","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communication Network Engineering, Technical University of Braunschweig, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Henning","lastName":"Sahlbach","id":"37391927800"},{"name":"Rolf Ernst","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communication Network Engineering, Technical University of Braunschweig, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Rolf","lastName":"Ernst","id":"37297213900"},{"name":"Wolfram Putzke-Roming","affiliation":["Deutsche Thomson Brandt GmbH, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfram","lastName":"Putzke-Roming","id":"38277271000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3781-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-9810-8015-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1591"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1101"}],"articleNumber":"5090628","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090628","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reconfigurable architectures","Field programmable gate arrays","Application specific integrated circuits","Costs","Noise reduction","Image resolution","Pixel","Functional programming","Hardware","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","image denoising","image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["film grain removal algorithm","heterogeneous reconfigurable architecture","real-time digital image processing","FPGA","heterogeneous computing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090628","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090628.pdf","startPage":"27","endPage":"32","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mapping of a film grain removal algorithm to a heterogeneous reconfigurable architecture","abstract":"Despite recent advances in FPGA, GPU, and general purpose processor technologies, the challenges posed by real-time digital image processing at high resolutions cannot be fully overcome due to insufficient processing capability, inadequate data transport and control mechanisms, and often prohibitively high costs. To address these issues, we proposed a two-phase solution for a real-time film grain noise reduction application. The first phase is based on a state-of-the-art FPGA platform used as a reference design. The second phase is based on a novel heterogeneous reconfigurable computing platform that offers flexibility not available from other computing paradigms. This paper introduces the heterogeneous platform and briefly reviews our previous work with the application in question, as well as its implementation on the FPGA demonstration board during the first phase. Then we present a decomposition of the application, which allows an efficient mapping to the new heterogeneous computing platform through the use of its diverse reconfigurable computing units and run-time reconfiguration.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090628/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10757799","publicationDate":"April 2009","conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5090628/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Mapping of a film grain removal algorithm to a heterogeneous reconfigurable architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mapping of a film grain removal algorithm to a heterogeneous reconfigurable architecture","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"02.3_1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070415S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5090631,"authors":[{"name":"Amirhossein Alimohammad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Amirhossein","lastName":"Alimohammad","id":"37295113600"},{"name":"Saeed F.

If this is not taken into consideration during the task allocation and scheduling process, some processors might age much faster than the others and become the reliability bottleneck for the system, thus significantly reducing the system's service life. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose an analytical model to estimate the lifetime reliability of multiprocessor platforms when executing periodical tasks, and we present a novel lifetime reliability-aware task allocation and scheduling algorithm based on simulated annealing technique. In addition, to speed up the annealing process, several techniques are proposed to simplify the design space exploration process with satisfactory solution quality. Experimental results on various multiprocessor platforms and task graphs demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090632","startPage":"51","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090632.pdf","endPage":"56","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090632","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090632/","displayDocTitle":"Lifetime reliability-aware task allocation and scheduling for MPSoC platforms","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5090632/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10757800","publicationDate":"April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lifetime reliability-aware task allocation and scheduling for MPSoC platforms","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"02.4_1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075956S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5090637,"authors":[{"name":"Omer Khan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Omer","lastName":"Khan","id":"37312343100"},{"name":"Sandip Kundu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Sandip","lastName":"Kundu","id":"37276072500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3781-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-9810-8015-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1591"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1101"}],"articleNumber":"5090637","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":328},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aging","Degradation","Hardware","Frequency","Transistors","Semiconductor device manufacture","Nanoscale devices","Negative bias temperature instability","Niobium compounds","Titanium compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","MOSFET","semiconductor device models","semiconductor device reliability","semiconductor device testing","software architecture","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-adaptive system architecture","transistor aging","system level reliability management scheme","operating frequency","voltage supply","calibration","aggressive wear-out conditions","negative bias temperature instability","device lifetime degradation","semiconductor manufacturing","co-designed virtual machine","hardware components","software components"]}],"abstract":"As semiconductor manufacturing enters advanced nanometer design paradigm, aging and device wear-out related degradation is becoming a major concern. Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) is one of the main sources of device lifetime degradation. The severity of such degradation depends on the operation history of a chip in the field, including such characteristics as temperature and workloads. In this paper, we propose a system level reliability management scheme where a chip dynamically adjusts its own operating frequency and supply voltage over time as the device ages. Major benefits of the proposed approach are (i) increased performance due to reduced frequency guard banding in the factory and (ii) continuous field adjustments that take environmental operating conditions such as actual room temperature and the power supply tolerance into account. The greatest challenge in implementing such a scheme is to perform calibration without a tester. Much of this work is performed by a hypervisor like software with very little hardware assistance. This keeps both the hardware overhead and the system complexity low. This paper describes the entire system architecture including hardware and software components. Our simulation data indicates that under aggressive wear-out conditions, scheduling interval of days or weeks is sufficient to reconfigure and keep the system operational, thus the run time overhead for such adjustments is of no consequence at all.","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090637","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090637.pdf","startPage":"81","endPage":"86","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A self-adaptive system architecture to address transistor aging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090637","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090637/","displayDocTitle":"A self-adaptive system architecture to address transistor aging","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10730344","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5090637/","conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A self-adaptive system architecture to address transistor aging","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"02.5_2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065047S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090637","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5090643,"authors":[{"name":"D.

A voltage ldquoemergencyrdquo, i.e., a swing beyond tolerable operating margins, jeopardizes the safe and correct operation of the processor. Techniques aimed at reducing power consumption, e.g., by clock gating or by reducing nominal supply voltage, exacerbate this noise problem, requiring ever-wider operating margins. We propose an event-guided, adaptive method for avoiding voltage emergencies, which exploits the fact that most emergencies are correlated with unique microarchitectural events, such as cache misses or the pipeline flushes that follow branch mispredictions. Using checkpoint and rollback to handle unavoidable emergencies, our method adapts dynamically by learning to trigger avoidance mechanisms when emergency-prone events recur. After tightening supply voltage margins to increase clock frequency and accounting for all costs, the net result is a performance improvement of 8% across a suite of fifteen SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An event-guided approach to reducing voltage noise in processors","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090651","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090651.pdf","startPage":"160","endPage":"165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090651","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090651/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"An event-guided approach to reducing voltage noise in processors","conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5090651/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10730366","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An event-guided approach to reducing voltage noise in processors","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"03.2_4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046376S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090651","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5090653,"authors":[{"name":"Kostas Siozios","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National and Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Kostas","lastName":"Siozios","id":"37281943000"},{"name":"Vasilis F.

The demand for higher clock frequencies and logic densities is also important for the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) paradigm. Three-dimensional (3-D) integration can alleviate such performance limitations by accommodating a number of additional silicon layers. However, the benefits of 3-D integration have yet to be sufficiently investigated. In this paper, we propose a software-supported methodology to explore and evaluate 3-D FPGAs fabricated with alternative technologies. Based on the evaluation results, the proposed FPGA device improves speed and energy dissipation by approximately 38% and 26%, respectively, as compared to 2-D FPGAs. Furthermore, these gains are achieved in addition to reducing the interlayer connections, as compared to existing design approaches, leading to cheaper and more reliable architectures.","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090653","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090653.pdf","startPage":"172","endPage":"177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A software-supported methodology for exploring interconnection architectures targeting 3-D FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090653/","displayDocTitle":"A software-supported methodology for exploring interconnection architectures targeting 3-D FPGAs","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5090653/","publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10730367","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A software-supported methodology for exploring interconnection architectures targeting 3-D FPGAs","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"03.3_2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070037S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5090655,"authors":[{"name":"Syed Zahid Ahmed","affiliation":["LIRMM UMR CNRS, University of Montpellier 2, France"],"firstName":"Syed Zahid","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37665148900"},{"name":"Julien Eydoux","affiliation":["Menta, France"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Eydoux","id":"37659155200"},{"name":"Laurent Rouge","affiliation":["Menta, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Rouge","id":"37659155000"},{"name":"Jean-Baptiste Cuelle","affiliation":["Menta, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Baptiste","lastName":"Cuelle","id":"37937436100"},{"name":"Gilles Sassatelli","affiliation":["LIRMM UMR CNRS, University of Montpellier 2, France"],"firstName":"Gilles","lastName":"Sassatelli","id":"37298938600"},{"name":"Lionel Torres","affiliation":["LIRMM UMR CNRS, University of Montpellier 2, France"],"firstName":"Lionel","lastName":"Torres","id":"37285662600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3781-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-9810-8015-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1591"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1101"}],"articleNumber":"5090655","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":233},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pipelines","Coprocessors","Energy consumption","Field programmable gate arrays","Frequency","Silicon","Internet","Power demand","Hardware","Computer aided instruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","low-power electronics","microprocessor chips","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LEON3 processor","ESL reprogrammable eFPGA","processor pipeline","coprocessor","embedded FPGA IP","processing power","dynamic frequency scaling","chip fabrication","low power process","static power","reconfigurable accelerator","HW partitioning","SW partitioning","silicon overhead","profiling tool","programming complexity","Catapult ESL tool","Mentor Graphics","microprocessors"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090655","abstract":"We will explore how processing power of LEON3 processor can be enhanced by connecting small commercially available embedded FPGA (eFPGA) IP with the processor.

The enhanced processing power helps to reduce dynamic power consumption by Dynamic Frequency Scaling. More computational power at lower frequency helps fabrication of chip in LP (Low Power) process compared to GP (General Purpose) which helps to significantly reduce Static Power which has become a very crucial issue at and beyond 90 nm technologies. Use of reconfigurable accelerator raises the question of its programming complexity, HW/SW partitioning and silicon overhead.

The reason is that usually the system-level model is written by a system architect, whereas the RTL implementation is created by a hardware designer. This approach leads to two models that are significantly different. Checking the equivalence of real-life designs requires strong solver technology. The challenges can only be overcome with a combination of bit-level and word-level reasoning techniques, combined with the right orchestration.

Our simulation shows when some links fail, the NoC with 2X-Links can recover from these faults with an average probability of 82.2% whereas these faults would be fatal for the Normal-Full-Duplex-Links.","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090667","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090667.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","startPage":"256","endPage":"261","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Configurable links for runtime adaptive on-chip communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090667","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Configurable links for runtime adaptive on-chip communication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090667/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10730390","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5090667/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Configurable links for runtime adaptive on-chip communication","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"03.7_2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062289S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090667","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5090673,"authors":[{"name":"Amirali Shayan","affiliation":["CSE Dept, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Amirali","lastName":"Shayan","id":"37393756700"},{"name":"Xiang Hu","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Hu","id":"37406696800"},{"name":"He Peng","affiliation":["CSE Dept, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"Peng","id":"37288759200"},{"name":"Chung-Kuan Cheng","affiliation":["CSE Dept, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chung-Kuan","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37277345600"},{"name":"Wenjian Yu","affiliation":["EDA Lab CST Department, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wenjian Yu","id":"37279839500"},{"name":"Mikhail Popovich","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mikhail","lastName":"Popovich","id":"37281717700"},{"name":"Thomas Toms","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Toms","id":"37071409900"},{"name":"Xiaoming Chen","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37403967800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3781-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-9810-8015-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1591"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1101"}],"articleNumber":"5090673","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":447},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090673","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Through-silicon vias","Integrated circuit reliability","Frequency domain analysis","Power systems","Skin effect","Integrated circuit noise","Fabrication","Voltage","Power distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elemental semiconductors","integrated circuit noise","integrated circuit reliability","power distribution reliability","silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliability","3D stacked ICs","3D power distribution network","power delivery networks","power noise","Si"]}],"abstract":"This work proposes reliability aware through silicon via (TSV) planning for the 3D stacked silicon integrated circuits (ICs).

However, mapping a task to any available PR region (PRR) requires a unique partial bitstream for each PRR. This replication can introduce significant overheads in terms of bitstream storage and communication requirements. Previous research in partial bitstream relocation can alleviate these overheads by transforming a single partial bitstream to map to any available PRR. However, careful steps are necessary to ensure proper functionality of relocated partial bitstreams and may result in clock routing inefficiencies. These routing inefficiencies can be alleviated by using regional clock resources introduced in the Virtex-4 FPGAs to implement local clock domains. PRRs can internally drive local clock domains, enabling each PRR to vary its clock frequency with respect to a single global clock signal, as opposed to sending multiple global clock signals (one for each desired clock frequency) to each PRR. We introduce this novel local clock domain (LCD) concept, which provides enhanced PR design flexibility. However, integration of LCDs and partial bitstream relocation introduces new challenges. In this paper, we identify motivating application domains for this integration, analyze integration benefits, and provide a detailed integration methodology.","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090676","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090676","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090676.pdf","startPage":"300","endPage":"303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090676/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Bitstream relocation with local clock domains for partially reconfigurable FPGAs","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10730398","htmlLink":"/document/5090676/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bitstream relocation with local clock domains for partially reconfigurable FPGAs","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"03.9_IP1_06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053246S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090676","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5090684,"authors":[{"name":"Leticia Bolzani","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Leticia","lastName":"Bolzani","id":"37282558800"},{"name":"Andrea Calimera","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Calimera","id":"37391631800"},{"name":"Alberto Macii","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Macii","id":"37267160500"},{"name":"Enrico Macii","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Macii","id":"37267985100"},{"name":"Massimo Poncino","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Poncino","id":"37274445600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3781-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-9810-8015-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1591"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1101"}],"articleNumber":"5090684","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":342},"abstract":"Clock-gating and power-gating have proven to be very effective solutions for reducing dynamic and static power, respectively. The two techniques may be coupled in such a way that the clock-gating information can be used to drive the control signal of the power-gating circuitry, thus providing additional leakage minimization conditions w.r.t. those manually inserted by the designer. This conceptual integration, however, poses several challenges when moved to industrial design flows. Although both clock and power-gating are supported by most commercial synthesis tools, their combined implementation requires some flexibility in the back-end tools that is not currently available. This paper presents a layout-oriented synthesis flow which integrates the two techniques and that relies on leading-edge, commercial EDA tools. Starting from a gated-clock netlist, we partition the circuit in a number of clusters that are implicitly determined by the groups of cells that are clock-gated by the same register. Using a row-based granularity, we achieve runtime leakage reduction by inserting dedicated sleep transistors for each cluster. The entire flow has been benchmarked on a industrial design mapped onto a commercial, 65 nm CMOS technology library.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090684.pdf","startPage":"334","endPage":"339","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090684","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090684","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enabling concurrent clock and power gating in an industrial design flow","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Circuit synthesis","CMOS technology","Coupling circuits","Minimization","Signal design","Signal synthesis","Electronic design automation and methodology","Registers","Runtime"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocks","CMOS digital integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concurrent clock","industrial design flow","dynamic power","static power","clock gating information","control signal","power gating circuitry","layout-oriented synthesis flow","row-based granularity","dedicated sleep transistors","CMOS technology library"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090684/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Enabling concurrent clock and power gating in an industrial design flow","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5090684/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10730425","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enabling concurrent clock and power gating in an industrial design flow","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"04.2_2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054345S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090684","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5090687,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Currently, the choice of supply voltage in SRAMs is governed by bit cell read static noise margin, writability, data retention etc. However, in the nanometer technology nodes, the choice of supply voltage impacts the reliability of SRAMs as well. Two important reliability challenges for current and future generation SRAMs are gate oxide degradation and soft error susceptibility. The current generation transistors have ultra-thin gate oxides to improve the device performance and they are prone to breakdown due to higher level of electric field stress. In addition, the soft error susceptibility of SRAMs has significantly increased in the nanometer regime. In this work, we have quantified the impact of voltage scaling on the soft error susceptibility of gate oxide degraded SRAMs.We show that when gate oxide degradation is taken into account, there exists an optimal voltage (V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">opt</sub>\n) at which the bit cell Qcrit is maximized. Further, we show that both V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">opt</sub>\n and Qcrit\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">max</sub>\n are a function of the level of oxide degradation. Finally, we investigate the impact of technology node scaling and analyze the trend of V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">opt</sub>\n and Qcrit\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">max</sub>\n. As the technology node shrinks to sub-45nm, both V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">opt</sub>\n and Qcritmax decrease sharply, thus significantly decreasing the reliability of SRAMs.","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090694","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090694","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090694.pdf","startPage":"387","endPage":"392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090694/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Impact of voltage scaling on nanoscale SRAM reliability","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10730433","htmlLink":"/document/5090694/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of voltage scaling on nanoscale SRAM reliability","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"04.5_3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094637S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090694","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5090695,"authors":[{"name":"Po-Liang Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Po-Liang Wu","id":"37929247800"},{"name":"Yuan-Hao Chang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yuan-Hao Chang","id":"37537830500"},{"name":"Tei-Wei Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tei-Wei","lastName":"Kuo","id":"37276775300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3781-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-9810-8015-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1591"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1101"}],"articleNumber":"5090695","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":21,"totalDownloads":589},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Flash memory","File systems","Computer science","Filters","Solid state circuits","Switches","Energy consumption","Design engineering","Degradation","Linux"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["file organisation","flash memories","meta data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash-memory storage system","FTL design","file-system-aware flash translation layer","file-system metadata","Linux device driver","filter mechanism design"]}],"abstract":"As flash memory became popular over various platforms, there is a strong demand on the performance degradation problem, due to the special characteristics of flash memory.

With power now the first-order design constraint, early-stage estimation of NoC power has become crucially important. ORION was amongst the first NoC power models released, and has since been fairly widely used for early-stage power estimation of NoCs. However, when validated against recent NoC prototypes - the Intel 80-core Teraflops chip and the Intel scalable communications core (SCC) chip - we saw significant deviation that can lead to erroneous NoC design choices. This prompted our development of ORION 2.0, an extensive enhancement of the original ORION models which includes completely new subcomponent power models, area models, as well as improved and updated technology models. Validation against the two Intel chips confirms a substantial improvement in accuracy over the original ORION. A case study with these power models plugged within the COSI-OCC NoC design space exploration tool confirms the need for, and value of, accurate early-stage NoC power estimation. To ensure the longevity of ORION 2.0, we will be releasing it wrapped within a semi-automated flow that automatically updates its models as new technology files become available.","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090700","endPage":"428","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090700.pdf","startPage":"423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ORION 2.0: A fast and accurate NoC power and area model for early-stage design space exploration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090700/","displayDocTitle":"ORION 2.0: A fast and accurate NoC power and area model for early-stage design space exploration","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10730455","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5090700/","publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ORION 2.0: A fast and accurate NoC power and area model for early-stage design space exploration","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"04.7_3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071506S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"429","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090700","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5090704,"authors":[{"name":"Shoun Matsunaga","affiliation":["Laboratory of Brainware Systems, Research Institute of Electrical Communication (RIEC), University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Shoun","lastName":"Matsunaga","id":"37302115600"},{"name":"Jun Hayakawa","affiliation":["Hitachi Advanced Research Laboratory, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Hayakawa","id":"37294739800"},{"name":"Shoji Ikeda","affiliation":["Laboratory of Nanoelectronics and Spintronics, RIEC, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Shoji","lastName":"Ikeda","id":"37286702900"},{"name":"Katsuya Miura","affiliation":["Laboratory of Nanoelectronics and Spintronics, RIEC, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan","Hitachi Advanced Research Laboratory, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Katsuya","lastName":"Miura","id":"37396584300"},{"name":"Tetsuo Endoh","affiliation":["Center of Interdisciplinary Research, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuo","lastName":"Endoh","id":"37319060700"},{"name":"Hideo Ohno","affiliation":["Laboratory of Nanoelectronics and Spintronics, RIEC, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideo","lastName":"Ohno","id":"37285306300"},{"name":"Takahiro Hanyu","affiliation":["Laboratory of Brainware Systems, Research Institute of Electrical Communication (RIEC), University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Takahiro","lastName":"Hanyu","id":"37069285400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3781-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-9810-8015-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1591"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1101"}],"articleNumber":"5090704","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1194},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090704","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic tunneling","Nonvolatile memory","Logic circuits","Memory architecture","Integrated circuit interconnections","Delay","MOSFETs","Scalability","Concrete","CMOS logic circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","logic circuits","magnetic tunnelling","memory architecture","MOSFET"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonvolatile logic-in-memory circuit","nonvolatile logic-in-memory architecture","ultra-low-power interconnection delay","reduced interconnection delay","magnetic tunnel junctions","MOS transistors","CMOS-process compatibility"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["nonvolatile","logic-in-memory","MTJ","standby-power-free","quick sleep/wake-up"]}],"abstract":"Nonvolatile logic-in-memory architecture, where nonvolatile memory elements are distributed over a logic-circuit plane, is expected to realize both ultra-low-power and reduced interconnection delay.

However, most of these designs have focused on the computational aspect of the ECC hardware, and not on the system integration into a SoC architecture. We study the impact of the communication link between CPU and coprocessor hardware for a typical ECC design, and demonstrate that the SoC may become performance-limited due to coprocessor data- and instruction-transfers. A dual strategy is proposed to remove the bottleneck: introduction of local control as well as local storage in the coprocessor. We quantify the impact of this strategy on a prototype implementation for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and measured an average speed-up in the resulting design of 9.4 times over the baseline ECC system, while the resulting system area increases by a factor of 1.6. The optimal area-time product improvement of our ECC coprocessor is 4.3 times compared to that of the baseline ECC coprocessor. Using design space exploration of a large number of system configurations using the latest FPGA technology and tools, we show that the optimal choice of ECC coprocessor parameters is strongly dependent on the efficiency of system-level communication.","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090708","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090708.pdf","startPage":"454","endPage":"459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing the HW/SW boundary of an ECC SoC design using control hierarchy and distributed storage","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090708/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing the HW/SW boundary of an ECC SoC design using control hierarchy and distributed storage","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5090708/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10730460","conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing the HW/SW boundary of an ECC SoC design using control hierarchy and distributed storage","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"05.3_2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057552S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090708","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5090716,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Due to the huge number of possible error configurations in complex circuits, a random selection of a subset of potential errors is usual in practical experiments. The main limitation of such a selection is the confidence in the outcomes that is never quantified in the articles. This paper proposes an approach to quantify both the error on the presented results and the confidence on the presented interval. The computation of the required number of faults to inject in order to achieve a given confidence and error interval is also discussed. Experimental results are shown and fully support the presented approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090716.pdf","startPage":"502","endPage":"506","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090716","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical fault injection: Quantified error and confidence","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Integrated circuit manufacture","Alpha particles","Emulation","Laboratories","Indium phosphide","Integrated circuit technology","Electromagnetic interference","Sea level","Neutrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","integrated circuits","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical fault injection","dependability analysis","integrated circuit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dependability analysis","statistical fault injection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090716/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Statistical fault injection: Quantified error and confidence","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5090716/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10730471","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical fault injection: Quantified error and confidence","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"05.5_4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048976S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090716","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5090717,"authors":[{"name":"Hyunjin Cho","affiliation":["School of ICE, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyunjin","lastName":"Cho","id":"37931663400"},{"name":"Dongkun Shin","affiliation":["School of ICE, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dongkun Shin","id":"37533902400"},{"name":"Young Ik Eom","affiliation":["School of ICE, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young Ik","lastName":"Eom","id":"37327350200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3781-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-9810-8015-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1591"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1101"}],"articleNumber":"5090717","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":438},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Flash memory","Ice","Electric shock","Digital audio players","Digital cameras","Hard disks","Fluctuations","Energy consumption","Power system management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories","low-power electronics","NAND circuits","real-time systems","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["K-associative sector translation","NAND flash memory","real-time system","nonfluctuating performance","low power consumption","high shock resistance","worst-case blocking time","best-case blocking time","flash translation layer","KAST","maximum log block associativity configuration","flash management technique","garbage collection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090717","abstract":"Flash memory is a good candidate for the storage device in real-time systems due to its non-fluctuating performance, low power consumption and high shock resistance. However, the garbage collection for invalid pages in flash memory can invoke a long blocking time. Moreover, the worst-case blocking time is significantly long compared to the best-case blocking time under the current flash management techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel Flash Translation Layer (FTL), called KAST, where user can configure the maximum log block associativity to control the worst-case blocking time. Performance evaluation using simulations shows that the overall performance of KAST is better than the current FTL schemes as well as KAST guarantees the longest block time is shorter than the specified value.","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090717","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090717.pdf","startPage":"507","endPage":"512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"KAST: K-associative sector translation for NAND flash memory in real-time systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"KAST: K-associative sector translation for NAND flash memory in real-time systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10730472","publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5090717/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090717/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"KAST: K-associative sector translation for NAND flash memory in real-time systems","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"05.6_1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083437S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090717","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5090727,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This work aims at providing an in-depth assessment of physical synthesis efficiency of fat-trees and at extrapolating silicon-aware performance figures to back-annotate in the system-level performance analysis. A 2D mesh is used as a reference architecture for comparison, and a 65 nm technology is targeted by our study. Finally, in an attempt to mitigate the implementation cost of k-ary n-tree topologies, we also review an alternative unidirectional multi-stage interconnection network which is able to simplify the fat-tree architecture and to minimally impact performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090727.pdf","startPage":"562","endPage":"565","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090727","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090727","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Assessing fat-tree topologies for regular network-on-chip design under nanoscale technology constraints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network topology","Network-on-a-chip","Switches","Computer architecture","Multiprocessor interconnection networks","Costs","Telecommunication traffic","Network synthesis","Parallel processing","Scalability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extrapolation","integrated circuit interconnections","integrated circuit layout","nanoelectronics","network topology","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fat-tree topology","network-on-chip design","nanoscale technology","on-chip interconnection network","traffic pattern","layout analysis","extrapolation","system-level performance analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090727/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Assessing fat-tree topologies for regular network-on-chip design under nanoscale technology constraints","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5090727/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10730481","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assessing fat-tree topologies for regular network-on-chip design under nanoscale technology constraints","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"05.9_IP2_03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09821S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5090742,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Since the design of the gates can be regularized, the ability to functionalize them in-field opens opportunities for novel regular fabrics based on ambipolar CNTFETs.

This successful attack, unambiguous as the full key is retrieved, is the first to be reported.","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090745.pdf","startPage":"640","endPage":"645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Successful attack on an FPGA-based WDDL DES cryptoprocessor without place and route constraints","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090745","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090745","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090745","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090745/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Successful attack on an FPGA-based WDDL DES cryptoprocessor without place and route constraints","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10730497","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5090745/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Successful attack on an FPGA-based WDDL DES cryptoprocessor without place and route constraints","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"06.3_3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069939S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090745","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5090749,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Cilardo","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Informatica e Sistemistica, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Cilardo","id":"37300501900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3781-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-9810-8015-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1591"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1101"}],"articleNumber":"5090749","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":228},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new speculative addition architecture suitable for two's complement operations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Circuits","Computer architecture","Heart","Microprocessors","Arithmetic","Added delay","Frequency","Error correction","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","carry logic","parallel programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speculative addition architecture","twos complement operations","operands","speculative global carry evaluation","adders"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090749","abstract":"Existing architectures for speculative addition are all based on the assumption that operands have uniformly distributed bits, which is rarely verified in real applications.

The heterogeneity has introduced challenges for energy efficiency in hardware and software implementations. This paper studies how to partition real-time tasks on a platform with heterogeneous processing elements (processors) so that the energy consumption can be minimized. The power consumption models considered in this paper are very general by assuming that the energy consumption with higher workload is larger than that with lower workload, which is true for many systems. We propose an approximation scheme to derive near-optimal solutions for different hardware configurations in energy/power consumption. When the number of processors is a constant, the scheme is a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) to derive a solution with energy consumption very close to the optimal energy consumption in polynomial-time/space complexity. Experimental results reveal that the proposed scheme is very effective in energy efficiency with comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090754","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090754.pdf","startPage":"694","endPage":"699","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An approximation scheme for energy-efficient scheduling of real-time tasks in heterogeneous multiprocessor systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090754","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090754/","displayDocTitle":"An approximation scheme for energy-efficient scheduling of real-time tasks in heterogeneous multiprocessor systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10730506","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5090754/","conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An approximation scheme for energy-efficient scheduling of real-time tasks in heterogeneous multiprocessor systems","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"06.6_3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07502S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090754","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5090757,"authors":[{"name":"Sawal Ali","affiliation":["Electronics System Devices Group, School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Sawal","lastName":"Ali","id":"37306076700"},{"name":"Li Ke","affiliation":["Electronics System Devices Group, School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, UK"],"lastName":"Li Ke","id":"37646897900"},{"name":"Reuben Wilcock","affiliation":["Electronics System Devices Group, School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Reuben","lastName":"Wilcock","id":"37270671100"},{"name":"Peter Wilson","affiliation":["Electronics System Devices Group, School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Wilson","id":"37271621900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3781-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-9810-8015-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1591"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1101"}],"articleNumber":"5090757","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","Analog integrated circuits","Design optimization","Integrated circuit yield","Performance analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Evolutionary computation","Circuit topology","Hardware design languages","Circuit testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue integrated circuits","circuit optimisation","evolutionary computation","hardware description languages","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit modelling","integrated circuit yield","Monte Carlo methods","network topology","phase locked loops","voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical-based optimisation","analogue integrated circuit","multiobjective evolutionary algorithm","Monte Carlo simulation","behavioural model","circuit topology","system level structure","Verilog-A","Spectre simulator","voltage controlled ring oscillator","PLL design","transistor level simulation"]}],"abstract":"A new approach in hierarchical optimisation is presented which is capable of optimising both the performance and yield of an analogue design.

The approach enables top-down system optimisation, not only for performance but also for yield. The model has been developed in Verilog-A and tested extensively with practical designs using the Spectre simulator.

In this paper, we propose to take advantage of the best characteristics that each technology has to offer through the use of read-write aware hybrid cache architecture (RWHCA) designs, where a single level of cache can be partitioned into read and write regions, each of a different memory technology with disparate read and write characteristics. We explore the potential of hardware support for intra-cache data movement within RWHCA caches. Utilizing a full-system simulator that has been validated against real hardware, we demonstrate that a RWHCA design with a conservative setup can provide a geometric mean 55% power reduction and yet 5% IPC improvement over a baseline SRAM cache design across a collection of 30 workloads. Furthermore, a 2-layer 3D cache stack (3DRWHCA) of high density memory technology with the same chip footprint still gives 10% power reduction and boost performance by 16% IPC improvement over the baseline.","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090762.pdf","startPage":"737","endPage":"742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090762","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090762","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power and performance of read-write aware Hybrid Caches with non-volatile memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power and performance of read-write aware Hybrid Caches with non-volatile memories","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090762/","conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5090762/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10730513","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power and performance of read-write aware Hybrid Caches with non-volatile memories","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"07.2_2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100505S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5090784,"authors":[{"name":"Pankaj Bhagawat","affiliation":["Department of E.C.E, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Pankaj","lastName":"Bhagawat","id":"37424290800"},{"name":"Rajballav Dash","affiliation":["Department of E.C.E, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Rajballav","lastName":"Dash","id":"37665004600"},{"name":"Gwan Choi","affiliation":["Department of E.C.E, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Gwan","lastName":"Choi","id":"37272560200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3781-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-9810-8015-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1591"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1101"}],"articleNumber":"5090784","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":228},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systolic like soft-detection architecture for 4\u00d74 64-QAM MIMO system","abstract":"MIMO systems (with multiple transmit and receive antennas) are becoming increasingly popular, and many next-generation systems such as WiMAX, 3-GPP LTE and IEEE802.11n wireless LANs relay on the increased throughput of MIMO systems with up to four antennas at receiver and transmitter. High throughput implementation of the detection unit for MIMO systems is a significant challenge especially for higher order modulation schemes. To achieve superior Bit Error Rate (BER) or Frame Error Rate (FER) performance, the detector has to provide soft values to advanced Forward Error Correction (FEC) schemes like Turbo Codes. This paper presents a systolic soft detector architecture for high dimensional (eg. 4times4, 64-QAM) MIMO systems.

For the recently available high definition frame sizes and high frame rates, the computational complexity of full search (FS) ME algorithm is prohibitively high, while the PSNR obtained by fast search ME algorithms is low. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new ME algorithm and a high performance reconfigurable systolic ME hardware architecture for efficiently implementing this algorithm. The proposed ME algorithm performs up to three different granularity search iterations in different size search ranges based on the application requirements. Simulation results showed that the proposed ME algorithm performs very close to FS algorithm, even though it searches much fewer search locations than FS algorithm. It outperforms successful fast search ME algorithms by searching more search locations than these algorithms. The proposed reconfigurable ME hardware is implemented in VHDL and mapped to a low cost Xilinx XC3S1500-5 FPGA. It works at 130 MHz and is capable of processing high definition and high frame rate video formats in real time. Therefore, it can be used in flat panel displays for frame rate conversion and de-interlacing, and in video encoders.","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090787","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090787.pdf","startPage":"882","endPage":"885","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090787","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high performance reconfigurable Motion Estimation hardware architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090787","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090787/","displayDocTitle":"A high performance reconfigurable Motion Estimation hardware architecture","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10730280","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5090787/","conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high performance reconfigurable Motion Estimation hardware architecture","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"07.9_IP3_04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061178S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5090795,"authors":[{"name":"Avesta Sasan","affiliation":["University of California, Irvine"],"firstName":"Avesta","lastName":"Sasan","id":"37547578200"},{"name":"Houman Homayoun","affiliation":["University of California, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Houman","lastName":"Homayoun","id":"37398927100"},{"name":"Ahmed Eltawil","affiliation":["University of California, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Eltawil","id":"37266114500"},{"name":"Fadi Kurdahi","affiliation":["University of California, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Fadi","lastName":"Kurdahi","id":"37267909800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3781-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-9810-8015-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1591"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1101"}],"articleNumber":"5090795","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":308},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Process Variation Aware SRAM/Cache for aggressive voltage-frequency scaling","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel Process Variation Aware SRAM architecture designed to inherently support voltage scaling.

This architecture allows reducing the power on the entire array; however it selectively trades power for correctness when rows containing weak cells are accessed. The cell sizing is designed to assure successful read operations. This avoids flipping the content of the cells when the wordline is overdriven. Our simulations report 23% to 30% improvement in cell access time and 31% to 51% improvement in cell write time in overdriven wordlines. Total area overhead is negligible (4%). Low voltage operation achieves more than 40% reduction in dynamic power consumption and approximately 50% reduction in leakage power consumption.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Energy consumption","Error correction codes","Manufacturing processes","Circuit faults","Charge pumps","Low voltage","Temperature sensors","Frequency","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power aware computing","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["process variation aware SRAM architecture","aggressive voltage-frequency scaling","cell sizing","low voltage operation","dynamic power consumption"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090795","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090795","startPage":"911","endPage":"916","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090795.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090795","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090795/","displayDocTitle":"Process Variation Aware SRAM/Cache for aggressive voltage-frequency scaling","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10730287","htmlLink":"/document/5090795/","conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Process Variation Aware SRAM/Cache for aggressive voltage-frequency scaling","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"08.2_1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078373S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5090796,"authors":[{"name":"Jawar Singh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of North Texas, USA","Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Jawar","lastName":"Singh","id":"37397123000"},{"name":"Dhiraj K.

In this paper, we examine the power/performance benefits for three different 3D stacked DRAM scenarios. Our high-level memory and Through Silicon Via (TSV) models have been calibrated on state-of-the-art industrial processes. We model the integration of a logic die with TSVs on top of both an existing DRAM and a DRAM with redesigned transceivers for 3D. Finally, we take advantage of the interconnect density enabled by 3D technology to analyze an ultra-wide memory interface. Experimental results confirm that TSV-based 3D integration is a promising technology option for future mobile applications, and that its full potential can be unleashed by jointly optimizing memory architecture and interface logic.","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090797","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090797.pdf","startPage":"923","endPage":"928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System-level power/performance evaluation of 3D stacked DRAMs for mobile applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"System-level power/performance evaluation of 3D stacked DRAMs for mobile applications","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10730289","publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5090797/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090797/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System-level power/performance evaluation of 3D stacked DRAMs for mobile applications","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"08.2_3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065986S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5090798,"authors":[{"name":"Anselme Vignon","affiliation":["K.U.

In this paper, we present a novel approximation algorithm for resource binding on scheduled datapaths at the presence of TMR, which aims at containment of each SEU within a single replica of tripled operations. The key challenges are to avoid resource sharing between modular redundant operations and also to reduce the possibility of TMR masking breaches in resource allocation. We introduce the notion of vulnerability gap during resource sharing to potentially reduce the effort for white space allocation at the physical design stage in order to avoid bridging faults between TMR resources. The experimental results show that our proposed resource binding algorithm, followed by floorplanner, reduces the potential of TMR breaches by 20%, on average.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090832/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10730313","htmlLink":"/document/5090832/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"SEU-aware resource binding for modular redundancy based designs on FPGAs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SEU-aware resource binding for modular redundancy based designs on FPGAs","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"09.4_4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088743S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090832","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5090845,"authors":[{"name":"Steve Perry","affiliation":["European Technology Centre, Altera Corporation, High Wycombe, UK"],"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Perry","id":"37266686400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3781-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-9810-8015-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1591"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1101"}],"articleNumber":"5090845","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":328},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Based Design needs high level synthesis - A collection of high level synthesis techniques to improve productivity and quality of results for model based electronic design","abstract":"Model Based Design tools based around Simulink from The MathWorks are a popular technology for the creation of streaming DSP designs for FPGAs, since they offer the promise of rapid design exploration through immediate quantitative feedback of algorithm performance. Current tools typically use a library of components that reflect an explicit representation of the underlying FPGA device features. This is undesirable since the designer is forced to mix implementation and architecture, and leads to long design cycles and non-portable results. This paper shows that introducing techniques of high level synthesis allows a more elegant design at a higher level of abstraction. This results in fewer components needed for a design which translates into a faster design cycle, more portable designs and fewer defects. Pushbutton clock frequencies of up to 500 MHz are achieved without detailed knowledge of FPGA architectures. Although the capabilities described are embodied in the DSP Builder tool from Altera, this paper describes the technology involved rather than the details of the tools. Four major technologies are described: a latency-insensitive system representation, the module level internal representation with associated transformations, hardware retiming, and lastly a FIR filter design tool layered on top.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["High level synthesis","Productivity","Algorithm design and analysis","Field programmable gate arrays","Digital signal processing","Feedback","Libraries","Clocks","Frequency","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data flow graphs","digital signal processing chips","field programmable gate arrays","FIR filters","high level synthesis","integer programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model based electronic design","high level synthesis","FPGA device","pushbutton clock frequency","DSP Builder tool","latency-insensitive system representation","module level internal representation","associated transformations","hardware retiming","FIR filter design tool","data flow graph","integer linear programming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Model Based Design","High Level Synthesis","FPGAs","Technology Mapping","Retiming","FIR Filter Design"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090845","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090845","startPage":"1202","endPage":"1207","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090845.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090845","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090845/","displayDocTitle":"Model Based Design needs high level synthesis - A collection of high level synthesis techniques to improve productivity and quality of results for model based electronic design","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10730326","htmlLink":"/document/5090845/","conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Based Design needs high level synthesis - A collection of high level synthesis techniques to improve productivity and quality of results for model based electronic design","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"09.8_2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064834S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5090850,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Although they are almost immune to permanent loss of the configuration data, they are composed of floating gate based switches that can suffer transient effects if hit by high energetic particles with critical consequences on the implemented logic. This paper presents a new way for the analysis of the impact of single event effects in flash-based FPGAs. We proposed a new methodology to identify the most critical switches inside the configuration logic block and the most redundant and robust configuration selection for each logic function.

Two FPGA implementations are proposed: the first one is low-cost oriented and the second one targets high-speed decoder.","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090854","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090854.pdf","startPage":"1242","endPage":"1245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090854","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A generic architecture of CCSDS Low Density Parity Check decoder for near-earth applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090854","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090854/","displayDocTitle":"A generic architecture of CCSDS Low Density Parity Check decoder for near-earth applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10730334","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5090854/","conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A generic architecture of CCSDS Low Density Parity Check decoder for near-earth applications","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"09.9_IP4_08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069666S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090854","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5090857,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Kollig","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors Research, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Kollig","id":"37293946800"},{"name":"Colin Osborne","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors Research, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Colin","lastName":"Osborne","id":"37930745800"},{"name":"Tomas Henriksson","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors Research, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Tomas","lastName":"Henriksson","id":"37265035400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3781-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-9810-8015-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1591"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1101"}],"articleNumber":"5090857","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multimedia systems","Computer architecture","Computer industry","Parallel processing","Decoding","TV","Consumer electronics","CMOS technology","Message passing","Microcontrollers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memory architecture","multimedia communication","system-on-chip","telecommunication networks","television applications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous multicore platform","consumer multimedia applications","SoC architecture","hybrid TV application","interprocessor communication","real-time performance","centralized memory systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["component","multiprocessor","TV","physically centralized memory system"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a multi-core SoC architecture for consumer multimedia applications.

Since cross-contamination between droplets of different biomolecules can lead to erroneous outcomes for bioassays, the avoidance of cross-contamination during droplet routing is a key design challenge for biochips. We propose a droplet-routing method that avoids cross-contamination in the optimization of droplet flow paths. The proposed approach targets disjoint droplet routes and minimizes the number of cells used for droplet routing. We also minimize the number of wash operations that must be used between successive routing steps that share unit cells in the microfluidic array. Two real-life biochemical applications are used to evaluate the proposed droplet-routing methods.","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090864","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090864.pdf","startPage":"1290","endPage":"1295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-contamination avoidance for droplet routing in digital microfluidic biochips","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090864/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cross-contamination avoidance for droplet routing in digital microfluidic biochips","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10730350","htmlLink":"/document/5090864/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-contamination avoidance for droplet routing in digital microfluidic biochips","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"10.2_5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056236S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090864","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5090867,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Muller","affiliation":["THOMSON-System Architecture Group, Villingen-Schwenningen, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Muller","id":"37067036800"},{"name":"Manuel Schreger","affiliation":["THOMSON-System Architecture Group, Villingen-Schwenningen, Germany"],"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Schreger","id":"37937032900"},{"name":"Marten Kabutz","affiliation":["THOMSON-System Architecture Group, Villingen-Schwenningen, Germany"],"firstName":"Marten","lastName":"Kabutz","id":"37937033500"},{"name":"Matthias Alles","affiliation":["Microelectronic Systems Design Research Group, University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Alles","id":"37700075900"},{"name":"Frank Kienle","affiliation":["Microelectronic Systems Design Research Group, University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Kienle","id":"37271663200"},{"name":"Norbert Wehn","affiliation":["Microelectronic Systems Design Research Group, University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Norbert","lastName":"Wehn","id":"37271665700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3781-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-9810-8015-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1591"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1101"}],"articleNumber":"5090867","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":676},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090867","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Decoding","Digital video broadcasting","Forward error correction","Gaussian processes","Convergence","Energy consumption","Clocks","Frequency","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BCH codes","clocks","decoding","digital video broadcasting","forward error correction","IP networks","iterative methods","parity check codes","receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["programmable forward error correction","Matthias DVB-S2 receiver","low-density parity check","Bose-Chaudhuri-Hoquenghem decoder","LDPC decoders","Gauss-Seidel decoding","permutation matrices","power consumption","clock frequency","memory consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Forward Error Correction","Soft Decision Decoding","LDPC","DVB-S2","Check Node approximation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper a programmable Forward Error Correction (FEC) IP for a DVB-S2 receiver is presented. It is composed of a Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC), a Bose-Chaudhuri-Hoquenghem (BCH) decoder, and pre- and postprocessing units. Special emphasis is put on LDPC decoding, since it accounts for the most complexity of the IP core by far. We propose a highly efficient LDPC decoder which applies Gauss-Seidel decoding. In contrast to previous publications, we show in detail how to solve the well known problem of superpositions of permutation matrices. The enhanced convergence speed of Gauss-Seidel decoding is used to reduce area and power consumption. Furthermore, we propose a modified version of the lambda-Min algorithm which allows to further decrease the memory requirements of the decoder by compressing the extrinsic information. Compared to the latest published DVB-S2 LDPC decoders, we could reduce the clock frequency by 40% and the memory consumption by 16%, yielding large energy and area savings while offering the same throughput.","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090867","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090867.pdf","startPage":"1308","endPage":"1313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel LDPC decoder for DVB-S2 IP","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A novel LDPC decoder for DVB-S2 IP","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5090867/","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10730352","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090867/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel LDPC decoder for DVB-S2 IP","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"10.3_3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079247S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090867","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5090868,"authors":[{"name":"Andre Guntoro","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Tech, Institute of Microelectronic Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Andre","lastName":"Guntoro","id":"37659498300"},{"name":"Manfred Glesner","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Tech, Institute of Microelectronic Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Manfred","lastName":"Glesner","id":"37277320300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3781-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-9810-8015-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1591"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1101"}],"articleNumber":"5090868","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet packets","Wavelet transforms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Filters","Computer architecture","Wavelet analysis","Electrical engineering","Fourier transforms","Polynomials","Helium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","floating point arithmetic","IEEE standards","microprocessor chips","packet radio networks","UHF filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible floating-point wavelet transform","wavelet filters","IEEE 754","lifting-based wavelet processor","inverse discrete wavelet transforms","discrete wavelet packets","clock cycles","multicontext configuration","memory sizes","32-bit implementation","multilevel transformations","memory","size 0.18 mum","frequency 353 MHz"]}],"abstract":"The richness of wavelet transformation is known in many fields.

Within this area, the vast majority of the verification effort in industry relies on logic simulation tools. However, logic simulators deliver limited performance when faced with vastly complex modern systems, especially synthesized netlists. The consequences are poor design coverage, delayed product releases and bugs that escape into silicon. Thus, we developed a novel GPU-accelerated logic simulator, called GCS, optimized for large structural netlists. By leveraging the vast parallelism offered by GP-GPUs and a novel netlist balancing algorithm tuned for the target architecture, we can attain an order-of-magnitude performance improvement on average over commercial logic simulators, and simulate large industrial-size designs, such as the OpenSPARC processor core design.","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090871","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090871.pdf","startPage":"1332","endPage":"1337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GCS: High-performance gate-level simulation with GPGPUs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090871","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090871/","displayDocTitle":"GCS: High-performance gate-level simulation with GPGPUs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10730355","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5090871/","conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GCS: High-performance gate-level simulation with GPGPUs","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"10.4_3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072965S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5090873,"authors":[{"name":"A.

With the rapid development of semiconductor memories, their test is becoming a major concern in VDSM technologies. It provides information about the SRAM design reliability, and its effectiveness is therefore mandatory for safety applications. Existing core-cell stability design-for-test (DfT) techniques consist in controlling the voltage levels of bit lines to apply a weak write stress on the core-cell under test. If the core-cell is weak, the weak write stress induces the faulty swap of the core-cell. However, these solutions are costly in terms of area and test application time, and generally require modifications of critical parts of the SRAM (core-cell array and/or the structure generating the internal auto-timing). In this paper, we present a new DfT technique for stability fault detection. It consists in modulating the word line activation in order to perform an adjustable weak write stress on the targeted core-cell for stability fault detection. Compared to existing DfT solutions, the proposed technique offers many advantages: programmability, low area overhead, low test application time. Moreover, it does not require any modification of critical parts of the SRAM.","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090873.pdf","startPage":"1344","endPage":"1348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new design-for-test technique for SRAM core-cell stability faults","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090873","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090873","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090873/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A new design-for-test technique for SRAM core-cell stability faults","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10730356","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5090873/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new design-for-test technique for SRAM core-cell stability faults","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"10.5_1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055766S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5090882,"authors":[{"name":"Chun Wei Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun Wei","lastName":"Lin","id":"37404185800"},{"name":"Bing-Shiun Hsieh","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Bing-Shiun","lastName":"Hsieh","id":"37928562400"},{"name":"Yu Cheng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu Cheng","lastName":"Lin","id":"38259379200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3781-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-9810-8015-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1591"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1101"}],"articleNumber":"5090882","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":617},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090882","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation converters","Power harmonic filters","Voltage","Power amplifiers","Power transistors","Heat sinks","Diodes","Capacitors","Adders","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio-frequency amplifiers","harmonic distortion","loudspeakers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filterless class-D audio amplifier","multilevel architecture technique","multilevel converter","time division adder","modulator","parallel control signal","total-harmonic-distortion","signal modulation","loud speaker"]}],"abstract":"In this work, we propose an enhanced design method for filterless class-D audio amplifier based on multilevel architecture. The multilevel technique consists of a multilevel converter and a time division adder followed by modulator. In this method, the modulated signal is arranged into several time divisions and then be integrated into a binary numeric. After that, the binary numeric is encoded to be a set of parallel control signal for multilevel converter. The multilevel converter will deliver multilevel signal to loudspeaker instead of conventional two-level signals. Consequently, improve the total-harmonic-distortion (THD) and signal-noise-ratio (SNR) significantly without sacrificing power efficiency.

Designing 3D stack architectures is a recently proposed approach to overcome the power consumption and delay problems associated with the interconnects by reducing the length of the wires going across the chip. However, 3D integration introduces serious thermal challenges due to the high power density resulting from placing computational units on top of each other. In this work, we first investigate how the existing thermal management, power management and job scheduling policies affect the thermal behavior in 3D chips. We then propose a dynamic thermally-aware job scheduling technique for 3D systems to reduce the thermal problems at very low performance cost. Our approach can also be integrated with power management policies to reduce energy consumption while avoiding the thermal hot spots and large temperature variations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic thermal management in 3D multicore architectures","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090885","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090885.pdf","startPage":"1410","endPage":"1415","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090885/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic thermal management in 3D multicore architectures","conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5090885/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10757820","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic thermal management in 3D multicore architectures","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"11.2_2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071781S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5090889,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Shafique","affiliation":["University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Shafique","id":"37408660000"},{"name":"Lars Bauer","affiliation":["University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Bauer","id":"37411983400"},{"name":"Jorg Henkel","affiliation":["University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Jorg","lastName":"Henkel","id":"37277243700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3781-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-9810-8015-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1591"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1101"}],"articleNumber":"5090889","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":249},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Automatic voltage control","Video codecs","Encoding","Motion pictures","Computational complexity","Video coding","Layout","Parallel processing","Application specific integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","microprocessor chips","video codecs","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high performance hardware design","H.264/AVC intra frame video codec","video coding","very high motion scenes","Intra Macroblocks","compression process","MIPS processor","group-based write-back scheme","Luma hardware"]}],"abstract":"The H.264/AVC Intra Frame Codec (i.e. all frames are coded as I-frames) targets high-resolution/high-end encoding applications (e.g. digital cinema and high quality archiving etc.), providing much better compression efficiency at lower computational complexity compared to MJPEG2000. Moreover, in case of video coding of very high motion scenes, the number of Intra Macroblocks is dominant. Intra Prediction is a compute intensive and memory-critical part that consumes 80% of the computation time of the entire Intra Compression process when executing the H.264 encoder on MIPS processor. We therefore present a novel hardware for H.264 Intra Prediction that processes all the prediction modes in parallel inside one integrated module (i.e. mode-level parallelism) enabling us to exploit the full space of optimization. It exhibits a group-based write-back scheme to reduce the memory transfers in order to facilitate the fast mode-decision schemes. Our Luma 4times4 hardware is 3.6times, 5.2times, and 5.5times faster than state-of-the-art approaches, QS0, respectively. Our results show that processing Luma 16times16, Chroma 8times8, and Luma 4times4 with the proposed approach is 7.2times, 6.5times, and 1.8times faster (while giving an energy saving of 60%, 80%, and 74%) when compared with Dedicated Module Approach (each prediction mode is processed with its independent hardware module i.e. a typical ASIC style for Intra Prediction).

Importantly, MIMO is not fully supported in most implementations. Implemented MIMO but with a simple linear detector. Our work explores the feasibility for SDR implementations of soft-output ML MIMO detectors, which brings 6-12 dB SNR gains when compared to popular linear detectors. Although soft-output ML MIMO detectors are considered to be challenging even for ASICs, we combine architecture-friendly algorithms, application specific instructions, code transformations and ILP/DLP explorations to make SDR implementations feasible. In our work, a 2times4 ADRES based ASIP with 16-way SIMD can deliver 193 Mbps for 2times2 64 QAM, and 368 Mbps for 2times2 16 QAM transmissions.

The proposed methodology is based on oscillation principles in which the Device-under-Test (DUT) itself generates the output test signature with the help of additional circuitry. The self-generated test signature from the DUT is analyzed by using onchip resources for testing the LNA and controlling its calibration knobs to compensate for multi-parameter variations in the LNA manufacturing process. Thus, the proposed methodology enables self-test and self-calibration of RF circuits without the need for external test stimulus. The proposed methodology is demonstrated through simulations as well as measurements performed on a RF LNA.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090929","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090929.pdf","startPage":"1656","endPage":"1661","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090929","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel self-healing methodology for RF Amplifier circuits based on oscillation principles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A novel self-healing methodology for RF Amplifier circuits based on oscillation principles","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5090929/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10730445","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090929/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel self-healing methodology for RF Amplifier circuits based on oscillation principles","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"12.5_2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068373S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090929","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5090937,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Telescopic units emerged as a scheme to automatically synthesize variable-latency circuits. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed that brings three main contributions with regard to the methods used for telescopic units: first, no multi-cycle timing analysis is required to ensure the correctness of the circuit; second, the method can be applied to large circuits; third, the circuit can be optimized for the most frequent input patterns. The approach is based on finding approximations of critical nodes in the netlist that substitute the exact behavior. Two cycles are required when the approximations are not correct. These approximations can be obtained by the simulation of traces applied to the circuit. Experimental results on selected examples show a tangible speed-up (15%) with a small area overhead (3%).","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2009.5090937","startPage":"1704","publicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926138/5090609/05090937.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2009.5090937","endPage":"1709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable-latency design by function speculation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5090937/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Variable-latency design by function speculation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5090937/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10730469","conferenceDate":"20-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable-latency design by function speculation","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"12.7_2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058357S","chronDate":"20-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926138","isNumber":"5090609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926138","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5090609","articleId":"5090937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDAA","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5090958,"authors":[{"name":"Kurt Derr","affiliation":["Idaho National Laboratory, Idaho Falls, ID, USA"],"firstName":"Kurt","lastName":"Derr","id":"37689240900"},{"name":"Milos Manic","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Idaho, Idaho Falls, Idaho Falls, ID, USA"],"firstName":"Milos","lastName":"Manic","id":"37277736800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3959-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3960-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-2246"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2254"}],"articleNumber":"5090958","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":890},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5090958","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Working environment noise","Robot sensing systems","Orbital robotics","Centralized control","Chemical sensors","Space exploration","Distributed control","Surveillance","Robot control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","distributed algorithms","mobile robots","multi-robot systems","particle swarm optimisation","radiocommunication","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multirobot system","multitarget particle swarm optimization search","noisy wireless environment","multiple small mobile robot","adaptive RSS weighting factor","distributed PSO algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fitness","Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)","Received Signal Strength (RSS)","wireless"]}],"doi":"10.1109/HSI.2009.5090958","pdfPath":"/iel5/5075460/5090940/05090958.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd Conference on Human System Interactions","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd Conference on Human System Interactions","startPage":"81","endPage":"86","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5090940","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HSI.2009.5090958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-robot, multi-target Particle Swarm Optimization search in noisy wireless environments","abstract":"Multiple small robots (swarms) can work together using particle swarm optimization (PSO) to perform tasks that are difficult or impossible for a single robot to accomplish.

In this report the EMC-FDTD simulator is used to model the interaction of bulk doped silicon with THz frequency electromagnetic plane waves. The performance of the simulation tool is investigated in terms of several simulation parameters, including grid cell size and carrier ensemble size. The complex conductivity of doped silicon at THz frequencies obtained from the combined EMC-FDTD solver is in good agreement with available experimental results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 13th International Workshop on Computational Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5091069/5091070/05091080.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 13th International Workshop on Computational Electronics","doi":"10.1109/IWCE.2009.5091080","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCE.2009.5091080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5091070","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5091080","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Global EMC-FDTD Simulation Tool for High-Frequency Carrier Transport in Semiconductors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Frequency","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Silicon","Monte Carlo methods","Electromagnetic compatibility","Maxwell equations","Robustness","Electromagnetic modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical conductivity","elemental semiconductors","finite difference time-domain analysis","high-frequency effects","Maxwell equations","Monte Carlo methods","silicon","terahertz wave spectra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global EMC-FDTD simulation","ensemble Monte Carlo simulator","finite-difference time-domain solver","high-frequency carrier transport","semiconductors","computational tool","conductive media","carrier dynamics","Maxwell's equations","field-particle dynamics","bulk doped silicon","terahertz frequency electromagnetic plane waves","grid cell size","complex conductivity","Si:Jk"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5091080/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Global EMC-FDTD Simulation Tool for High-Frequency Carrier Transport in Semiconductors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5091080/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10730740","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","conferenceDate":"27-29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Global EMC-FDTD Simulation Tool for High-Frequency Carrier Transport in Semiconductors","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"PID876976.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051576S","chronDate":"27-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5091069","isNumber":"5091070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5091069","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5091070","articleId":"5091080","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5091093,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolaos Rizos","affiliation":["Institute for Nanoelectronics, Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Nikolaos","lastName":"Rizos","id":"38276039200"},{"name":"Murad Omar","affiliation":["Institute for Nanoelectronics, Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Murad","lastName":"Omar","id":"38272616200"},{"name":"Paolo Lugli","affiliation":["Institute for Nanoelectronics, Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Lugli","id":"37274485500"},{"name":"Gyorgy Csaba","affiliation":["Institute for Nanoelectronics, Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Gyorgy","lastName":"Csaba","id":"38297941900"},{"name":"Markus Becherer","affiliation":["Institute for Technical Electronics, Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Becherer","id":"37394350500"},{"name":"Doris Schmitt-Landsiedel","affiliation":["Institute for Technical Electronics, Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Doris","lastName":"Schmitt-Landsiedel","id":"38270167300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3925-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3927-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5091093","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Couplings","Magnetic multilayers","Wires","Magnetic domains","Magnetic fields","Magnets","Micromagnetics","Computational modeling","Large-scale systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic gates","magnetic fields","magnetic multilayers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocking schemes","field coupled devices","magnetic multilayers","magnetic field-coupled computing devices","magnetic dots","XOR gate","large- scale logic devices"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces a clocking scheme that can be applied in magnetic field-coupled computing devices made from Co/Pt multilayers. The clocking wires are buried under the magnetic computing layer. Oscillating currents running through these wires generate an easy-axis field in the plane of the magnets. We show that this field can propagate signals between the magnetic dots and prevents frustration and splitting of the dots into multiple domains. We demonstrate our concept on a full micromagnetic simulation of an XOR gate. We argue that large-scale logic devices could be built based on this architecture.","doi":"10.1109/IWCE.2009.5091093","publicationTitle":"2009 13th International Workshop on Computational Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 13th International Workshop on Computational Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5091069/5091070/05091093.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCE.2009.5091093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5091070","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clocking Schemes for Field Coupled Devices from Magnetic Multilayers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5091093","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Clocking Schemes for Field Coupled Devices from Magnetic Multilayers","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5091093/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10730753","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5091093/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clocking Schemes for Field Coupled Devices from Magnetic Multilayers","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"PID879650.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035489S","chronDate":"27-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5091069","isNumber":"5091070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5091069","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5091070","articleId":"5091093","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5091124,"authors":[{"name":"Kelin J.
