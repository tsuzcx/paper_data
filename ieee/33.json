We present a parallel programming paradigm called ASC (ASsociative Computing), designed for a wide range of computing engines. Our paradigm has an efficient associative-based, dynamic memory-allocation mechanism that does not use pointers. It incorporates data parallelism at the base level, so that programmers do not have to specify low-level sequential tasks such as sorting, looping and parallelization. Our paradigm supports all of the standard data-parallel and massively parallel computing algorithms. It combines numerical computation (such as convolution, matrix multiplication, and graphics) with nonnumerical computing (such as compilation, graph algorithms, rule-based systems, and language interpreters). This article focuses on the nonnumerical aspects of ASC.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/330039/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1994","volume":"27","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4836244","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"ASC: an associative-computing paradigm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ASC: an associative-computing paradigm","sourcePdf":"00330039.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038266S","chronDate":"Nov.  1994","isNumber":"7814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"44","articleId":"330039","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":330100,"authors":[{"name":"G.H.

The problem of appropriate termination in the guide environment has recently been addressed. Main remaining disadvantages are the volume of computation involved and lack of analytical insight. Moreover equivalent circuits are prerequisites to effective CAD and synthesis. With a view to remedying these shortcomings, we discuss the extraction from the FDTD analysis of equivalent circuits. Two significant examples are considered: the inductive post and the 90/spl deg/ H-plane corner, including a modified form of the same. The circuits thus obtained are subsequently employed in the CAD problem of matching over the full waveguide hand the modified corner by means of two inductive screws. Theoretical and experimental results are in excellent agreement yielding a reflection /spl les/-12 dB over the band 36-40 GHz and showing the effectiveness of the approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.330124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.330124","endPage":"2098","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00330124.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/7816/00330124.pdf","startPage":"2093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband matching of waveguide discontinuities by FDTD methods","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/330124/","displayDocTitle":"Wideband matching of waveguide discontinuities by FDTD methods","volume":"42","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"4826209","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband matching of waveguide discontinuities by FDTD methods","sourcePdf":"00330124.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037379S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"7","articleId":"330124","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":330127,"authors":[{"name":"M.S.

The FDTD-type interface provides a more efficient way to realize time-domain diakoptics than TLM, especially for device optimization problems. To emulate the TLM-type interface in FDTD, two novel algorithms are developed in this paper. One is to implement an ultra-wideband absorbing boundary on the excitation plane during excitation. The other is to separate directional waves without the knowledge of incident waves. For a large circuit with cascaded modules, sequential and parallel algorithms are provided to connect them. With these connecting algorithms, time-domain diakoptics is one candidate method to realize modular and parallel computation in FDTD simulations. The validity of these algorithms is confirmed by comparison with simulated results from Microwave SPICE.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.330131","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/7816/00330131.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.330131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7816","startPage":"2149","endPage":"2155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The implementation of time-domain diakoptics in the FDTD method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=330131","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The implementation of time-domain diakoptics in the FDTD method","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/330131/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4826216","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The implementation of time-domain diakoptics in the FDTD method","sourcePdf":"00330131.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042909S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"25","articleId":"330131","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":330140,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The extension of the service into the PCN domain, mostly in-buildings and in pedestrian areas, further enhances this trend. The vision of the \"third generation\" cellular systems incorporates micro- and picocells for pedestrian use, with macrocells for roaming mobiles. Connectivity between all these cells, while maximizing total system capacity, is the main challenge facing the \"third generation architects.\" The CDMA cellular system, which shares the same frequency channel across the system (reuse pattern of one) and applies soft handoff between the cells, has already shown, both by analysis and by tests, to have full connectivity between the microcells and the overlaying macrocells without capacity degradation. The parameters involved in the engineering of a heterogeneous CDMA network are discussed in the paper. Factors that determine the size of the cell, the soft handoff zone, and the capacity of the cell clusters are analyzed, and engineering techniques for overlay-underlay cell clustering are outlined.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/330140/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","volume":"43","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4820746","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Microcell engineering in CDMA cellular networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microcell engineering in CDMA cellular networks","sourcePdf":"00330140.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034174S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"101","articleId":"330140","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":330143,"authors":[{"name":"A.S.

Five existing cells were systematically surveyed: two in downtown Toronto, two in the suburbs, and one in a suburban/rural area. A sweeping correlator apparatus with a 0.1 /spl mu/s resolution and 910 MHz carrier frequency, and an omnidirectional antenna was used. In one of the cells, the measurements were repeated with a 60 degree beamwidth directional antenna. A fairly sophisticated thresholding technique was applied in order to reduce the impact of noise. Generally, the measurements with the omnidirectional antenna exhibit multipath propagation with considerably smaller excess delays than some reported, but are consistent with earlier results obtained in the U.S. and Europe. Sectorization was found to considerably reduce the multipath effects. Very large delay components appear to be due mostly to the combination of large transmitter-receiver distances and a large degree of shadowing, and could probably be avoided to a large extent by standard cellular engineering techniques. In view of these results, it seems that the long delay (high selectivity) problem has been somewhat overemphasized in the past, at least for areas like Toronto. Problems associated with short delays (flat fading), on the contrary, appear to have been underestimated in the case of dense urban environments.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/330145/","volume":"43","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4820749","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Delay spread measurements for the digital cellular channel in Toronto","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay spread measurements for the digital cellular channel in Toronto","sourcePdf":"00330145.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066579S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"124","articleId":"330145","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":330146,"authors":[{"name":"N.L.B.

A ray tracing model for predicting propagation based on a building blueprint representation is presented for a transmitter and receiver located on the same floor inside a building. Measured and predicted propagation data are presented as power delay profiles that contain the amplitude and arrival time of individual multipath components. Measured and predicted power delay profiles are compared on a location-by-location basis to provide both a qualitative and a quantitative measure of the model accuracy. The concept of effective building material properties is developed, and the effective building material properties are derived for two dissimilar buildings based upon comparison of measured and predicted power delay profiles. Time delay comparison shows that the amplitudes of many significant multipath components are accurately predicted by this model. Path loss between a transmitter and receiver is predicted with a standard deviation of less than 5 dB over 45 locations in two different buildings.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.330150","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/7817/00330150.pdf","startPage":"879","endPage":"891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.330150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Site-specific propagation prediction for wireless in-building personal communication system design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=330150","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/330150/","displayDocTitle":"Site-specific propagation prediction for wireless in-building personal communication system design","volume":"43","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4820754","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Site-specific propagation prediction for wireless in-building personal communication system design","sourcePdf":"00330150.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094841S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"382","articleId":"330150","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":330153,"authors":[{"name":"Han-Lee Song","affiliation":["Siemens, Taoyuan, Hsien, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Han-Lee Song","id":"37649633500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"330153","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":82,"citationCountPatent":20,"totalDownloads":610},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=330153","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Cellular phones","Base stations","Computer simulation","Fuzzy logic","Communication systems","Attenuation","Uncertainty","Automatic control","Computer errors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["road vehicles","cellular radio","land mobile radio","position measurement","fuzzy logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic vehicle location","cellular communications systems","base stations","cellular phone","attenuation","vehicle position","point-to-area terrain configuration","signal strength","fuzzy logic","location accuracy"]}],"abstract":"The paper presents a method of automatic vehicle location (AVL). Signals are transmitted from base stations in a cellular communications system. A device is embedded into a cellular phone installed in a vehicle. When this vehicle is traveling through a cellular territory, the device receives those signals and calculates the attenuation of those signals to locate the current vehicle position. A preliminary study by using computer simulation shows that the error between the exact position and the estimated position is in the range from 0 to 575 m. This result is based on the assumptions that the base stations are separated from each other by 5 km and the point-to-area terrain configuration has a 3 dB standard deviation of a normal signal strength distribution. A further modification by employing fuzzy logic is under development. The goal is to keep the location accuracy within 200 m.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.330153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.330153","endPage":"908","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/7817/00330153.pdf","startPage":"902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic vehicle location in cellular communications systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/330153/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic vehicle location in cellular communications systems","volume":"43","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4826238","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic vehicle location in cellular communications systems","sourcePdf":"00330153.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036128S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"82","articleId":"330153","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":330154,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.B.

The effects of room size, data rate, transmitted power and sector antenna patterns on the performance of the systems are analyzed. A 2-D ray tracing algorithm is used to model the radio propagation in a typical indoor environment used for wireless LAN applications. The parameters of the radio propagation model are adjusted to fit the results of simulations to the results of empirical measurements with omnidirectional antenna. It is shown that in a line-of-sight (LOS) environment, a six-sector antenna is more effective than a DFE with an omnidirectional antenna at eliminating the effects of multipath. For an obstructed-line-of-sight (OLOS) environment where at least one wall exists between the transmitter and the receiver, the DFE is more effective than the six-sector antenna. It is shown that a BPSK/DFE modem with a six-sector antenna can support data rates close to 20 Mbps.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.330155","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/7817/00330155.pdf","startPage":"925","endPage":"933","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00330155.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.330155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sector antenna and DFE modems for high speed indoor radio communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=330155","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/330155/","displayDocTitle":"Sector antenna and DFE modems for high speed indoor radio communications","volume":"43","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4826240","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sector antenna and DFE modems for high speed indoor radio communications","sourcePdf":"00330155.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035035S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"41","articleId":"330155","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":330158,"authors":[{"name":"M.C.

The average bit error rate (BER) of the discrete time switched diversity system using binary noncoherent frequency shift keying (NCFSK) on slow, nonselective Ricean fading channels is derived. A closed form expression that gives the optimum switching threshold in a minimum error rate sense is derived for the case of independent branch signals. Results for the optimum switching threshold for the case of correlated branch signals, obtained numerically, are also presented. Results using selection diversity combining are obtained for comparison. The effects of fading severity on both the BER and on the optimum switching threshold are investigated. The Ricean fading model may be used to model both the microcellular radio environment and the mobile satellite fading channel. Hence, the results of the paper are useful for both of these areas.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00330159.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/7817/00330159.pdf","startPage":"970","endPage":"976","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.330159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.330159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7817","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=330159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Switched diversity on microcellular Ricean channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Diversity reception","Bit error rate","Diversity methods","Performance analysis","Frequency shift keying","Satellite broadcasting","Probability density function","Power system modeling","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency shift keying","diversity reception","land mobile radio","cellular radio","mobile satellite communication","Rician channels","fading","error statistics","telecommunication switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microcellular Ricean channels","switched dual diversity systems","Ricean fading channels","discrete time model","average bit error rate","binary noncoherent frequency shift keying","NCFSK","slow nonselective Ricean fading channels","closed form expression","optimum switching threshold","minimum error rate","correlated branch signals","selection diversity combining","mobile satellite fading channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/330159/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"Switched diversity on microcellular Ricean channels","volume":"43","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4826244","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switched diversity on microcellular Ricean channels","sourcePdf":"00330159.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"95","articleId":"330159","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":330160,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The experiments were carried out using four different modulation schemes at some of the different standardized signaling rates. The modulation schemes used were: FSK @ 300 baud, DPSK @ 1200 baud, QPSK @ 1200 baud, and 8-ary PSK @ 1600 baud, and in each case, subcarrier modulation was used. The experiments were undertaken for urban as well as freeway environments. Fritchman-partitioned Markov chain models were derived throughout, and from the models, block error probability distributions were derived. These block error probability distributions or P(m,n) give the probability that a block of n bits will contain exactly m errors. We present P(/spl ges/m,n) for 7-, 15-, 31-, 63-, 127-, and 255-b blocks, for the above-mentioned modulation schemes, in the mobile VHF environments mentioned. P(/spl ges/m,n) denotes the probability that at least m errors will occur in a block of n bits. Furthermore, the P(/spl ges/m,n) information presented here, should give some indication of the performance to be expected from block error-correcting schemes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.330160","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00330160.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/7817/00330160.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.330160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7817","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"977","endPage":"985","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Markov characterization of digital fading mobile VHF channels","volume":"43","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4826245","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/330160/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Markov characterization of digital fading mobile VHF channels","sourcePdf":"00330160.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029231S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"70","articleId":"330160","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":330161,"authors":[{"name":"Fayu Li","affiliation":["CDSP Research Center, Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Fayu Li","id":"37652550900"},{"name":"L.F.

The authors propose and evaluate a multiaccess protocol for integrating data traffic in the E(nhanced)-TDMA voice system with digital speech interpolation, which is an enhancement of the emerging North American digital cellular standard. The proposed, protocol combines random access with slot reservation mechanisms to statistically multiplex data packets with speech spurt packets over the shared terminal-to-base air channel. The integrated protocol requires no modification in the voice access protocol used in the E-TDMA system, and can attain performance close to that of an ideal voice/data multiplexer. Furthermore, the protocol may enable multislot assignment per TDMA frame to match the throughput needs of individual data terminals, and can accommodate application-dependent data transmission priorities.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.330161","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/7817/00330161.pdf","startPage":"986","endPage":"996","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00330161.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.330161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voice/data channel access integration in TDMA digital cellular networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=330161","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/330161/","displayDocTitle":"Voice/data channel access integration in TDMA digital cellular networks","volume":"43","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4826246","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voice/data channel access integration in TDMA digital cellular networks","sourcePdf":"00330161.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050312S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"18","articleId":"330161","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-11"},{"_id":330164,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The errors originate in the transition regions between adjacent symbols when deep fades occur. We show that fractional-bit differential detection with proper timing avoids these transition regions and decreases the irreducible errors. Assuming an MSK modulation format and slow Rayleigh fading, we derive a formula for calculation of the error probability in which we apply an \"effective delay spread.\" A procedure to predict the effective delay spread is proposed. We verify the calculated error probability by a Monte Carlo software simulation for three different delay power profiles. The approach increases the tolerable delay spread in an unequalized receiver by a factor of 2 to 5 depending on the details of the delay power profile. Filtering the MSK signal tends to smear the transition region over the entire symbol duration, reducing the effectiveness of fractional-bit detection. This explains qualitatively the mismatch between theory and experiment in previously published results. We discuss the conditions of filtering and of finite signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under which fractional-bit detection is effective. For instance, for a delay spread around one-tenth of the symbol length, improvement is gained if the SNR is above 15 dB.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.330167","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00330167.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/7817/00330167.pdf","startPage":"1039","endPage":"1048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.330167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Suppression of the irreducible errors in a frequency-selective fading channel by fractional-bit differential detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/330167/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"Suppression of the irreducible errors in a frequency-selective fading channel by fractional-bit differential detection","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4826252","volume":"43","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Suppression of the irreducible errors in a frequency-selective fading channel by fractional-bit differential detection","sourcePdf":"00330167.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046954S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"5","articleId":"330167","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":330168,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A ray-tracing algorithm based on this is employed to describe propagation in 3-D structures, like rectangular rooms or street canyons. Space-dependent complex impulse responses are calculated. These are compared to the results of high resolution measurements of the space-dependent complex impulse response in the same environments. If conducted in an appropriate manner, the measurements yield very dense information about the propagation in the measured environment.

The speech coding algorithm is based on code-excited linear prediction (CELP) and it provides good communication quality speech at a rate of 4 kbps. For the channel code, both rate-compatible punctured convolutional (RCPC) codes and punctured Reed-Solomon (PRS) codes are considered. In the case of RCPC codes, soft decision decoding is considered, in addition to the simpler hard decision decoding. The modulation format chosen in our study is /spl pi//4-DQPSK with differential detection. Unequal error protection is used based on the bit error sensitivities of the different speech parameters. The performance of the combined speech and channel codec is studied under different mobile channel conditions, such as fade rates, signal-to-noise ratios, and interleaving delays. The results indicate that, with no interleaving delay and a large channel signal-to-noise ratio, PRS codes and RCPC codes with soft decision decoding have similar performance, given in terms of the segmental signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) of the reconstructed speech. At low channel SNR, RCPC codes with soft decision decoding are significantly better than PRS codes. Informal listening tests were also conducted and the results indicate that the difference between the quality of the reconstructed speech in an error-free channel and that in a Rayleigh fading channel is imperceptible at channel SNRs larger than 20 dB for both the RCPC and the PRS-based codecs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/7817/00330171.pdf","startPage":"1078","endPage":"1087","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.330171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.330171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7817","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=330171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined speech and channel coding for mobile radio communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech coding","Channel coding","Land mobile radio","Mobile communication","Decoding","Signal to noise ratio","Speech codecs","Interleaved codes","Delay","Convolutional codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["land mobile radio","channel coding","speech codecs","speech coding","digital radio","linear predictive coding","demodulation","convolutional codes","Reed-Solomon codes","quadrature phase shift keying","differential phase shift keying","decoding","Rayleigh channels","fading","speech intelligibility"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","signal-to-noise ratio","speech coding","digital mobile radio communications","CELP","speech quality","code excited linear prediction","interleaving delay","rate-compatible punctured convolutional codes","Rayleigh fading channel","punctured Reed-Solomon codes","soft decision decoding","hard decision decoding","informal listening tests","/spl pi//4-DQPSK","differential detection","unequal error protection","bit error sensitivities","speech parameters","channel codec","speech codec","mobile channel conditions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/330171/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"Combined speech and channel coding for mobile radio communications","volume":"43","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4826256","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined speech and channel coding for mobile radio communications","sourcePdf":"00330171.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030996S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"9","articleId":"330171","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":330172,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Since the seventies progress has been made in exploiting the higher velocities and electromechanical coupling constants (K/sup 2/=2/spl Delta/v/v) achievable with PSAW's for piezoelectric device applications; this has stimulated new interest in the search for piezoelectric materials with orientations which have low /spl alpha//spl lambda/, high K/sup 2/, high v/sub p/. Procedures for calculating the PSAW properties (v/sub p/, /spl alpha//spl lambda/, and K/sup 2/) are not very explicitly given. In light of the preceding we present in this paper a review of the basic features of SAW and PseudoSAW's using the matrix method. In this paper: the mechanically free open-circuited and short-circuited surface wave boundary value problems for piezoelectrics are formulated using the matrix method; two types of modes (SAW and PSAW) are described; and a number of computationally simple, frequency independent analytical functions are derived, from which /spl alpha//spl lambda/, v/sub p/, and K/sup 2/ are calculated for any direction on any material plane using commercially available PC software. The relationship of these functions to the effective permittivity concept, favoured by many researchers, is demonstrated and illustrative numerical examples for the PSAW's reveals that low-loss orientations are quite sensitive to material constant values.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.330269","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/7819/00330269.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.330269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7819","startPage":"876","endPage":"882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAW and pseudo-SAW properties using matrix methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=330269","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SAW and pseudo-SAW properties using matrix methods","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/330269/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4815293","pubMedId":"18263278","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAW and pseudo-SAW properties using matrix methods","sourcePdf":"00330269.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034887S","chronDate":"Nov.  1994","isNumber":"7819","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"110","articleId":"330269","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":330278,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This paper describes a vision system for 1) automatic inspection of that part of the wire bond where the wire connects to the bond pad on the chip and 2) inspection of the 2-D profile of the bonding wire. A popular type of bonding (connection to bond pad) known as \"ball bond\" is considered here. Using two-dimensional images taken from the top of the IC wafer, the system determines several geometric measures which are important in determining the quality of the bond and the wire. These include the center and the boundary of the bond as well as the degree of straightness of the wire. A bond shape analysis based on the parameters of the best fitting ellipse to the bond is developed. The bonding process can be monitored through tracking the statistics of the bond shape measures. The system has been tested in a prototype manufacturing environment with excellent results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00330278.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel3/66/7820/00330278.pdf","startPage":"413","endPage":"422","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","doi":"10.1109/66.330278","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/66.330278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=330278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A vision system for inspection of ball bonds and 2-D profile of bonding wires in integrated circuits","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine vision","Inspection","Wire","Wafer bonding","Shape measurement","Integrated circuit manufacture","Fingers","Semiconductor device measurement","Fitting","Bonding processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic optical inspection","integrated circuit interconnections","lead bonding","image enhancement","image segmentation","image matching","quality control","integrated circuit manufacture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vision system","AOI","ball bonds","2D wire profile","bonding wires","integrated circuits","manufacture","automatic inspection","two-dimensional images","bond shape analysis","best fitting ellipse"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/330278/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"A vision system for inspection of ball bonds and 2-D profile of bonding wires in integrated circuits","volume":"7","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4827460","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A vision system for inspection of ball bonds and 2-D profile of bonding wires in integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"00330278.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094507S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"20","articleId":"330278","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":330301,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The theory puts no restrictions on the system input which can be an arbitrary finite energy signal; bandlimitedness is not required. In contrast to previous approaches, this formulation allows for an independent specification of the sampling (analysis) and approximation (synthesis) spaces. In particular, when both spaces are identical, the theorem provides a simple procedure for obtaining the least squares approximation of a signal. They discuss the properties of this new sampling procedure and present some examples of applications involving bandlimited, and polynomial spline signal representations. They also define a spectral coherence function that measures the \"similarity\" between the sampling and approximation spaces, and derive a relative performance bound for the comparison with the least squares solution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.330352","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7823/00330352.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.330352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823","startPage":"2915","endPage":"2925","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00330352.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A general sampling theory for nonideal acquisition devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=330352","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A general sampling theory for nonideal acquisition devices","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/330352/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4827965","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A general sampling theory for nonideal acquisition devices","sourcePdf":"00330352.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034283S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"251","articleId":"330352","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":330353,"authors":[{"name":"C.S.

The comparison is done in terms of the steady-state excess mean-square estimation error /spl xi/ and the steady-state mean-square weight deviation, /spl eta/. It is shown that /spl xi/ does not depend on the spread of eigenvalues of the input covariance matrix, R, in the cases of the LMS algorithm and the SA, while it does in the case of the RLS algorithm. In the three algorithms, /spl eta/ is found to be increasing with the eigenvalue spread. The value of the adaptation parameter that minimizes /spl xi/ is different from the one that minimizes /spl eta/. It is shown that the minimum values of /spl xi/ and /spl eta/ attained by the RLS algorithm are equal to the ones attained by the LMS algorithm in any one of the three following cases: (1) if R has equal eigenvalues, (2) if the fluctuations of the individual elements of the optimal vector are mutually uncorrelated and have the same mean-square value, or (3) if R is diagonal and the fluctuations of the individual elements of the optimal vector have the same mean-square value. Conditions that make the values of /spl xi/ and /spl eta/ of the LMS algorithm smaller (or greater) than the ones of the RLS algorithm are derived. For Gaussian input data, the minimum values of /spl xi/ and /spl eta/ attained by the SA are found to exceed the ones attained by the LMS algorithm by 1 dB independently of R and the mutual correlation between the elements of the optimal vector.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.330354","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7823/00330354.pdf","startPage":"2937","endPage":"2944","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00330354.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.330354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of RLS, LMS, and sign algorithms for tracking randomly time-varying channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=330354","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/330354/","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of RLS, LMS, and sign algorithms for tracking randomly time-varying channels","volume":"42","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4827967","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of RLS, LMS, and sign algorithms for tracking randomly time-varying channels","sourcePdf":"00330354.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02528S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"161","articleId":"330354","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":330357,"authors":[{"name":"L.

First, the fractal signal transmission process is transformed via the analysis filter bank into multiscale convolution subsystems in time-scale domain based on orthonormal wavelets. Some nonstationary properties, e.g., self-similarity, long-term dependency of fractal signals are attenuated in each subband by wavelet multiresolution decomposition so that the Wiener filter bank can be applied to estimate the multiscale input signals. Then the estimated multiscale input signals are synthesized to obtain the estimated input signal. Some simulation examples are given for testing the performance of the proposed algorithm.

The FRFT depends on a parameter /spl alpha/ and can be interpreted as a rotation by an angle /spl alpha/ in the time-frequency plane. An FRFT with /spl alpha/=/spl pi//2 corresponds to the classical Fourier transform, and an FRFT with /spl alpha/=0 corresponds to the identity operator. On the other hand, the angles of successively performed FRFTs simply add up, as do the angles of successive rotations. The FRFT of a signal can also be interpreted as a decomposition of the signal in terms of chirps. The authors briefly introduce the FRFT and a number of its properties and then present some new results: the interpretation as a rotation in the time-frequency plane, and the FRFT's relationships with time-frequency representations such as the Wigner distribution, the ambiguity function, the short-time Fourier transform and the spectrogram. These relationships have a very simple and natural form and support the FRFT's interpretation as a rotation operator. Examples of FRFTs of some simple signals are given. An example of the application of the FRFT is also given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.330368","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7823/00330368.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.330368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823","startPage":"3084","endPage":"3091","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00330368.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The fractional Fourier transform and time-frequency representations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=330368","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The fractional Fourier transform and time-frequency representations","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/330368/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4827981","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The fractional Fourier transform and time-frequency representations","sourcePdf":"00330368.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110356S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"1201","articleId":"330368","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":330369,"authors":[{"name":"J.B.

It is then of interest to identify which pulses are from which source, based on different source characteristics. This sorting task is termed deinterleaving. the authors propose time-domain techniques for deinterleaving pulse trains from a finite number of periodic sources based on the time of arrival (TOA) and pulse energy, if available, of the pulses received on the one communication channel. They formulate the pulse train deinterleaving problem as a stochastic discrete-time dynamic linear model (DLM), the \"discrete-time\" variable k being associated with the kth received pulse. The time-varying parameters of the DLM depend on the sequence of active sources. The deinterleaving detection/estimation task can then be done optimally via linear signal processing using the Kalman filter (or recursive least squares when the source periods are constant) and tree searching. The optimal solution, however, is computationally infeasible for other than small data lengths since the number of possible sequences grow exponentially with data length. The authors propose and study two of a number of possible suboptimal solutions: 1) forward dynamic programming with fixed look-ahead rather than total look-ahead as required for the optimal scheme; 2) a probabilistic teacher Kalman filtering for the detection/estimation task.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deinterleaving pulse trains using discrete-time stochastic dynamic-linear models","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.330369","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7823/00330369.pdf","startPage":"3092","endPage":"3103","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00330369.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.330369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=330369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/330369/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"Deinterleaving pulse trains using discrete-time stochastic dynamic-linear models","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4827982","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deinterleaving pulse trains using discrete-time stochastic dynamic-linear models","sourcePdf":"00330369.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029178S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"41","articleId":"330369","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":330372,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The spectrum estimation problem is set up as a problem of inference on the wavelet coefficients of a signal corrupted by additive non-Gaussian noise. We propose a wavelet thresholding technique to solve this problem under specified noise/resolution tradeoffs and show that the wavelet coefficients of the additive noise may be treated as independent random variables.

The same framework applies if one desires to determine whether the given random signal is non-Gaussian. The most commonly used method for detection of random signals is the so-called energy detector, which cannot distinguish between Gaussian and non-Gaussian signals and requires the knowledge of the noise power. Recently, the use of bispectrum and/or trispectrum of the signal has been suggested for detection of non-Gaussian signals. The higher order spectra-based detectors do not require the knowledge of the noise statistics if the noise is Gaussian. In this paper, we suggest the use of an integrated polyspectrum (bispectrum of trispectrum) to improve computational efficiency of the detectors based on polyspectrum and to possibly further enhance their detection performance. We investigate conditions under which use of the integrated polyspectrum is appropriate. The detector structure is derived, acid its performance is evaluated via simulations and comparisons with several other existing approaches.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.330373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.330373","startPage":"3137","endPage":"3149","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7823/00330373.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00330373.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of non-Gaussian signals using integrated polyspectrum","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"Detection of non-Gaussian signals using integrated polyspectrum","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"42","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4827986","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/330373/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of non-Gaussian signals using integrated polyspectrum","sourcePdf":"00330373.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047333S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"68","articleId":"330373","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":330375,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

The Radon-Wigner transform can be efficiently implemented with dechirping in the time domain, however, only half of the possible projections through the time-frequency plane can be realized because of aliasing. We show here that the frequency dual to dechirping exists, so that all of the time-frequency plane projections can be calculated efficiently. Both time and frequency dechirping are shown to warp the time-frequency plane rather rotating it, producing an angle dependent dilation of the Radon-Wigner projection axis. We derive the discrete-time equations for both time and frequency dechirping, and highlight some practical implementation issues. Discrete dechirping is shown to correspond to line integration through the extended-discrete, rather than the discrete, Wigner-Ville distribution. Computationally, dechirping is O(2N log 2N) instead of O(N/sup 3/) for direct projection, and the computation is dominated by the fast Fourier transform calculation. The noise and cross-term suppression of the Radon-Wigner transform are demonstrated by several examples using dechirping and using direct Radon-Wigner transformation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.330375","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7823/00330375.pdf","startPage":"3166","endPage":"3177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.330375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radon transformation of time-frequency distributions for analysis of multicomponent signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=330375","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/330375/","displayDocTitle":"Radon transformation of time-frequency distributions for analysis of multicomponent signals","volume":"42","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4827988","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radon transformation of time-frequency distributions for analysis of multicomponent signals","sourcePdf":"00330375.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060593S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"195","articleId":"330375","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":330378,"authors":[{"name":"Shaomin Mo","affiliation":["AT and T Bell Laboratories, Inc., Holmdel, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Shaomin Mo","id":"37088095003"},{"name":"B.

This new approach divides the problem into two parts. First, it employs the characteristic of the linear system to estimate the original channel based on the fourth-order cumulants instead of time samples of the channel output. Thus, nonminimum phase channels can be handled. Second, it utilizes the nonlinear characteristics of the neural network to build an inverse system (equalizer) for the original channel. This is done by using the estimated channel as a reference system to train the neural network. The neural network helps the equalizer to reduce the degree of model uncertainty and makes the equalizer resistant to additive noise. Taking the advantages of both linear and nonlinear systems, this new scheme works well for both stationary and nonstationary cases and leads to good equalization results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/330378/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","volume":"42","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"4827991","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Blind equalization using higher order cumulants and neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind equalization using higher order cumulants and neural network","sourcePdf":"00330378.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060054S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"23","articleId":"330378","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":330379,"authors":[{"name":"K.I.

We assume that the transmitted signal and the number of paths in the multipath environment are known and develop an algorithm that gives least-squares (LS) estimates of the amplitude and time delay of each path. Direct computation of the LS estimates would involve minimization of a highly oscillatory error function. By allowing the amplitudes to be complex valued, a much smoother error function that is easier to minimize using gradient-based techniques is obtained. Using this property and the knowledge (derived from the data) of the spacing between adjacent minima in the actual LS error function, an efficient algorithm is devised. The algorithm is a function of a data-dependent parameter, and we give rules for choosing this parameter. The algorithm is demonstrated on a broad-band signal, using simulated data. The proposed method is shown to achieve the Cramer-Rao lower bound over a wide range of SNR's.

The performance of the proposed system is analyzed and simulation results are presented to verify the convergence properties of the algorithm under varying degrees of vectorization.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.330384","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00330384.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7823/00330384.pdf","startPage":"3237","endPage":"3240","doi":"10.1109/78.330384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vectorization of the DLMS transversal adaptive filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"Vectorization of the DLMS transversal adaptive filter","volume":"42","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4827996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/330384/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vectorization of the DLMS transversal adaptive filter","sourcePdf":"00330384.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029109S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"3","articleId":"330384","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":330385,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Such an analytic signal is complex and contains only positive frequencies. Its projection onto the real axis is the same as the original signal. Our use stems from instantaneous-frequency estimation and time-frequency signal analysis problems. For these problems the negative frequency component of real signals causes unwanted interference. The task of designing a filter to produce an approximation to the ideal analytic signal is not as simple as its formulation might suggest. Our result is that the direct methods of zeroing the negative frequencies, or using Hilbert transform filters, have undesirable defects. We present an alternative which is similar to the \"quadrature\" filters used in modem designs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/330385/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"42","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4827997","displayDocTitle":"Analytic signal generation-tips and traps","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytic signal generation-tips and traps","sourcePdf":"00330385.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025088S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"64","articleId":"330385","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":330386,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Blommer","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Blommer","id":"37659174800"},{"name":"G.H.

For this purpose, we require accurate wire-length estimates, since wire delays contribute significantly to the overall delay. We present a new technique for wire-length estimation based on a combination of analytical and constructive approaches. Given these wire-length estimates and the cell delays, it is possible to provide worst case delay paths in the design based on the circuit topology. We have also extended our technique to consider false paths, which provides a more accurate functionality based estimate that takes into account the estimated layout information. We validate our technique using the standard MCNC benchmarks. Our results indicate an average 7% accuracy in the worst case delay predictions for designs with up to about 2800 cells.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.331402","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/7831/00331402.pdf","startPage":"1450","endPage":"1460","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.331402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7831","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined topological and functionality-based delay estimation using a layout-driven approach for high-level applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=331402","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/331402/","displayDocTitle":"Combined topological and functionality-based delay estimation using a layout-driven approach for high-level applications","volume":"13","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4830432","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined topological and functionality-based delay estimation using a layout-driven approach for high-level applications","sourcePdf":"00331402.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051863S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"10","articleId":"331402","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":331404,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The Actel family of FPGA's exemplifies the row-based FPGA model. Rows of logic cells interspersed with routing channels have given this family of FPGA devices the flavor of traditional channeled gate arrays or standard cells. However, unlike the conventional standard cell design, the FPGA routing channels contain predefined wiring segments of various lengths that are interconnected using antifuses. This paper develops analytical models that permit the design of FPGA channel architecture and the analysis of the routability of row-based FPGA devices based on a generic characterization of the row-based FPGA routing algorithms. In particular, it demonstrates that using probabilistic models for the origination point and length of connections, an FPGA with properly designed segment length and distribution can be nearly as efficient as a mask-programmable channel (in terms of the number of required tracks). Experimental results corroborate this prediction. This paper does not address specifics of the routing algorithms, but investigates the design of the channel segmentation architecture (i.e., various lengths and patterns of segments and connections among these segments) in order to increase the probability of successful routing.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.331404","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.331404","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/7831/00331404.pdf","startPage":"1470","endPage":"1479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7831","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/331404/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"Design and analysis of segmented routing channels for row-based FPGA's","volume":"13","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4830434","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and analysis of segmented routing channels for row-based FPGA's","sourcePdf":"00331404.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03869S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"18","articleId":"331404","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":331405,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Wei Yeh","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Wei Yeh","id":"37276120800"},{"name":"Chung-Kuan Cheng","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department M/S C-0114, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Chung-Kuan Cheng","id":"37277345600"},{"name":"T.T.Y.

In this paper, we discuss several objective functions derived from such an extension and propose an iterative improvement algorithm to solve the multiple-way partitioning problem.

The second phase performs iterative improvement on the clustered circuit using a Dew net-based move model and a Primal-Dual refinement procedure. The third phase is the same as the second phase except that the iterative improvement is done on the original circuit.

Specifically, the gates are switching faster and the interconnect delays are getting longer due to scaling. This results in a trend in which the RC interconnect delay is beginning to comprise a larger portion of the overall logic stage delay. This shift in relative delay dominance from the gate to the RC interconnect is increased by resistance shielding. That is, as the gate \"resistance\" gets smaller and the metal resistance gets larger, the gate no longer \"sees\" the total net capacitance and the gate delay may be significantly less than expected. This trend complicates the timing analysis of digital circuits, which relies upon simple, empirical gate delay equations for efficiency. In this paper, we develop an analytical expression for the \"effective load capacitance\" of a pc interconnect. In addition, when there is significant shielding, the response waveforms at the gate output may have a large exponential tail. We show that this waveform tail can strongly influence the delay of the RC interconnect. Therefore, we propose an extension of the effective capacitance equation that captures the complete waveform response accurately, with a two-piece gate-output-waveform approximation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/7831/00331409.pdf","startPage":"1526","endPage":"1535","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/43.331409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.331409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7831","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=331409","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling the \"Effective capacitance\" for the RC interconnect of CMOS gates","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semiconductor device modeling","Capacitance","Integrated circuit interconnections","Equations","Delay effects","CMOS logic circuits","Timing","Tail","Predictive models","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitance","integrated circuit interconnections","integrated circuit modelling","RC circuits","CMOS logic circuits","logic gates","timing","delays","shielding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["effective capacitance","RC interconnect","CMOS gates","line widths","switching speeds","on-chip metal interconnect","timing behavior","logic gates","interconnect delays","scaling","overall logic stage delay","resistance shielding","timing analysis","empirical gate delay equations","response waveforms","two-piece gate-output-waveform approximation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/331409/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"Modeling the \"Effective capacitance\" for the RC interconnect of CMOS gates","volume":"13","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4830439","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling the \"Effective capacitance\" for the RC interconnect of CMOS gates","sourcePdf":"00331409.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028713S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"223","articleId":"331409","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":331411,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Five test classes are introduced and their properties are discussed. We present an algorithm for deriving a logic system for TPG that results in an earlier recognition of conflicting value assignments. RESIST uses the logic system derived for each test class for an optimal search strategy. In contrast to other approaches, it exploits the fact that many paths in a circuit have common subpaths. RESIST sensitizes those subpaths only once, reducing the number of value assignments during path sensitization significantly. In addition, our procedure identifies large sets of untestable path delay faults without enumerating them. RESIST is capable of performing TPG for all path delay faults in all ISCAS-85 and ISCAS-89 circuits. For the first time, results for all path delay faults in circuit c6288 are presented. A comparison with other TPG systems revealed that RESIST is significantly faster than all previously published methods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.331411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7831","startPage":"1550","endPage":"1562","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/7831/00331411.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RESIST: a recursive test pattern generation algorithm for path delay faults considering various test classes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/331411/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"RESIST: a recursive test pattern generation algorithm for path delay faults considering various test classes","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4830441","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"12","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RESIST: a recursive test pattern generation algorithm for path delay faults considering various test classes","sourcePdf":"00331411.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034692S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"61","articleId":"331411","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":331412,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The feasible optimal solution for the dispatch problem can only reside in one of the feasible, spaces, and can be found by performing the conventional /spl lambda/-/spl delta/ iterative search based on the equal-incremental-cost criterion in each of the feasible spaces. However, for a system with a large number of decision spaces, such an exhaustive search method would not be acceptable in real time operation due to its high computational time requirement. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed. It defines a small and advantageous set of decision spaces, uses an efficient algorithm to determine the most advantageous space and then utilizes the conventional /spl lambda/-/spl delta/ iterative method to find the feasible optimal dispatch solution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.331425","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/7832/00331425.pdf","startPage":"1737","endPage":"1743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.331425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A practical approach to real time economic dispatch considering unit's prohibited operating zones","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=331425","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/331425/","displayDocTitle":"A practical approach to real time economic dispatch considering unit's prohibited operating zones","volume":"9","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4837621","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A practical approach to real time economic dispatch considering unit's prohibited operating zones","sourcePdf":"00331425.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087902S","chronDate":"Nov.  1994","isNumber":"7832","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"58","articleId":"331425","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":331428,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

In order to forecast the load precisely through a year, one should consider seasonal load change, annual load growth and the latest daily load change. To deal with these characteristics in the load forecasting, a transformation technique is presented. This technique consists of a transformation function with translation and reflection methods. The transformation function is estimated with the previous year's data points, in order that the function converts the data points into a set of new data points with preservation of the shape of temperature-load relationships in the previous year. Then, the function is slightly translated so that the transformed data points will fit the shape of temperature-load relationships in the year. Finally, multivariate regression analysis, with the latest daily loads and weather observations, estimates the forecasting model. Large forecasting errors caused by the weather-load nonlinear characteristic in the transitional seasons such as spring and fall are reduced. Performance of the technique which is verified with simulations on actual load data of Tokyo Electric Power Company is also described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.331433","startPage":"1788","endPage":"1794","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.331433","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7832","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/7832/00331433.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regression based peak load forecasting using a transformation technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/331433/","displayDocTitle":"Regression based peak load forecasting using a transformation technique","volume":"9","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4837628","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regression based peak load forecasting using a transformation technique","sourcePdf":"00331433.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040983S","chronDate":"Nov.  1994","isNumber":"7832","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"221","articleId":"331433","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":331443,"authors":[{"name":"Bih-Yuan Ku","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Bih-Yuan Ku","id":"37087912669"},{"name":"R.J.

The evaluation of options for economically complying with these limits is complicated by uncertainties in a number of key variables such us the price of emission allowances, the price premiums to be paid for low sulphur coal and other costs associated with viable, unit-specific compliance options: installing scrubbers, switching to lower sulphur coal and taking no compliance action. The problem is further complicated by the fact that minimum cost compliance options for individual units can only be determined as the units are committed and dispatched over time taking into account planned and expected forced outages. A method is proposed for solving this combined planning-operation optimization problem over a time horizon of interest using a fast unit commitment and dispatch heuristic. The method is applied to a large utility with 26 coal burning units subject to the provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act. Representative runs indicate that the method generally converges to optimal solutions in 30 minutes or less on a personal computer. Thus, the planner can quickly explore the impacts of various assumptions regarding the prices of emission allowances, fuel premiums etc. upon optimal compliance options for individual units.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.331451","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00331451.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","startPage":"1921","endPage":"1926","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.331451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7832","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/7832/00331451.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacity planning","Cost function","Switches","Convergence","Equations","Processor scheduling","Production planning","Fuel economy","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["steam power stations","air pollution","air pollution control","sulphur compounds","power system planning","load dispatching","optimisation","power system analysis computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal planning","SO/sub 2/ emission compliance","Clean Air Act","coal-burning units","emission allowance prices","low sulphur coal","unit-specific compliance options","scrubbers","forced outages","fast unit commitment","fast dispatch heuristic","personal computer","fuel premiums","SO/sub 2/"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An approach to optimal planning for SO/sub 2/ emission compliance","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/331451/","volume":"9","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4837647","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An approach to optimal planning for SO/sub 2/ emission compliance","sourcePdf":"00331451.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036376S","chronDate":"Nov.  1994","isNumber":"7832","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"11","articleId":"331451","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":331452,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Insights gained during the development of the model regarding the choice of the input variables and their transformations, the design of the ANN structure, the selection of the training cases and the training process itself are described in the paper. Attention was paid to model accurately special events, such as holidays, heat-waves, cold snaps and other conditions that disturb the normal pattern of the load. The significant impact of special events on the model's performance was established through testing of an existing load forecasting package that is in production use. The new model has been tested under a wide variety of conditions and it is shown in this paper to produce excellent results. Comparison results between the existing. regression based model and the ANN model are very encouraging. The ANN model consistently outperforms the existing model in terms of both average errors over a long period of time and number of \"large\" errors. The ANN model has also been integrated with PG&E's Energy Management System (EMS). It is envisioned that the ANN model will eventually substitute the existing model to support the Company's real-time operations. In the interim both models will be available for production use.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.331456","startPage":"1956","endPage":"1962","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/7832/00331456.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.331456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An implementation of a neural network based load forecasting model for the EMS","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Load forecasting","Load modeling","Predictive models","Artificial neural networks","Testing","Production","Electric variables control","Input variables","Packaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system control","load forecasting","load management","learning (artificial intelligence)","statistical analysis","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","load forecasting model","EMS","short-term system load forecasting model","energy control center","Pacific Gas and Electric Company","power system","training","holidays","heat-waves","cold snaps","testing","regression based model","average errors","Energy Management System","real-time operations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/331456/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1994","displayDocTitle":"An implementation of a neural network based load forecasting model for the EMS","volume":"9","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4837652","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An implementation of a neural network based load forecasting model for the EMS","sourcePdf":"00331456.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103489S","chronDate":"Nov.  1994","isNumber":"7832","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"165","articleId":"331456","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":331463,"authors":[{"name":"N.S.

Such resources could be photovoltaic cells, wind generation, battery storage, fuel cells or demand-side management solicitations. Research by others has suggested that the benefits of distributed resources could be substantial. However, these distributed benefits are site specific. A method to optimally locate such resources in a meshed network for maximizing the potential benefits is outlined in this paper. The proposed second order algorithm computes the amount of resources in selected nodes to make up a given total to achieve the desired optimizing objectives. The network under consideration could be a transmission, subtransmission, or distribution network. The benefit expressed as a performance index can be the minimization of losses, VAr losses, or loadings in selected lines.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.331463","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/7832/00331463.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.331463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7832","startPage":"2014","endPage":"2020","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum location of resources in distributed planning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=331463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimum location of resources in distributed planning","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/331463/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4843789","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum location of resources in distributed planning","sourcePdf":"00331463.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086829S","chronDate":"Nov.  1994","isNumber":"7832","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"269","articleId":"331463","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":331469,"authors":[{"name":"Mang-Hui Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan Institute of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Mang-Hui Wang","id":"37087159863"},{"name":"Hong-Chan Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan Institute of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hong-Chan Chang","id":"37087189951"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8950"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0679"}],"articleNumber":"331469","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":284},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering methods","Artificial neural networks","Power system dynamics","Frequency measurement","Clustering algorithms","Power generation","Power system measurements","Rotors","Performance analysis","Power system analysis computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system stability","power system analysis computing","neural nets","rotors","learning (artificial intelligence)","digital simulation","electric generators","machine theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power systems","dynamic equivalents","coherent generators","coherency identification","clustering method","artificial neural network","K-means algorithm","rotor speeds","computer simulation","feature patterns","learning algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=331469","abstract":"A novel clustering method using an artificial neural network (ANN) is presented to identify the coherent generators for dynamic equivalents of power systems. First, a new frequency measure is devised to indicate the degree of coherency among system generators.

The rotor speeds at three selected instants in time are used as the feature patterns for the learning algorithm. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive analyses are performed on two different power systems of varying sizes with rather encouraging results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.331469","startPage":"2056","endPage":"2062","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.331469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7832","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/7832/00331469.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel clustering method for coherency identification using an artificial neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/331469/","displayDocTitle":"Novel clustering method for coherency identification using an artificial neural network","volume":"9","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4837661","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel clustering method for coherency identification using an artificial neural network","sourcePdf":"00331469.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084162S","chronDate":"Nov.  1994","isNumber":"7832","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"31","articleId":"331469","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":331478,"authors":[{"name":"Bing Liu","affiliation":["National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Bing Liu","id":"37440228600"},{"name":"Siew-Hwee Choo","affiliation":["National University of Singapore, Singapore","National University of Singapore, Singapore, SG"],"lastName":"Siew-Hwee Choo","id":"37663267400"},{"name":"Shee-Ling Lok","affiliation":["Dept. of Inf.

The algorithm is derived from the classical Hebbian rule. An asymptotic analysis is carried out to show that the algorithm allows the weight vector of a linear neuron unit to converge to the eigenvector associated with the smallest eigenvalue of the correlation matrix of the input signal. When the algorithm is applied to solve parameter estimation problems, the converged weights directly yield the total least-squares solution. Since the process of obtaining the estimate is optimal in the total least-squares sense, its noise rejection capability is superior to those of the least-squares-based algorithms. It is shown that the implementations of the proposed algorithm have the simplicity of those of the LMS algorithm. The applicability and performance of the algorithm are demonstrated through computer simulations of adaptive FIR and IIR parameter estimation problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.331542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7835","startPage":"718","endPage":"729","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/7835/00331542.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A constrained anti-Hebbian learning algorithm for total least-squares estimation with applications to adaptive FIR and IIR filtering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/331542/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A constrained anti-Hebbian learning algorithm for total least-squares estimation with applications to adaptive FIR and IIR filtering","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4833172","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"41","issue":"11","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A constrained anti-Hebbian learning algorithm for total least-squares estimation with applications to adaptive FIR and IIR filtering","sourcePdf":"00331542.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05912S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"46","articleId":"331542","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":331543,"authors":[{"name":"Seehyun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Control and Instrumentation Engineering and Inter-university Semiconductor Research Center, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seehyun Kim","id":"37087366402"},{"name":"Wonyong Sung","affiliation":["Department of Control and Instrumentation Engineering and Inter-university Semiconductor Research Center, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Wonyong Sung","id":"37087154231"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7130"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-125X"}],"articleNumber":"331543","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":390},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Assembly","Signal processing","Digital signal processors","Instruments","Programming profession","Statistics","Application software","IIR filters","Environmental economics","Digital arithmetic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","floating point arithmetic","digital arithmetic","program assemblers","instruction sets","fast Fourier transforms","IIR filters","program interpreters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["floating-point to fixed-point assembly program translator","TMS 320C25","digital signal processor","DSP-like programming environment","Texas Instruments","fixed-point DSP chip","floating-point instruction set","floating-point data format","fourth-order IIR filter","Levinson-Durbin recursion","FFT routine"]}],"abstract":"A floating-point digital signal processor-like programming environment is developed for the Texas Instruments TMS 320C25, a fixed-point digital signal professor. Programmers first develop an assembly program using a hypothetical floating-point instruction set and a floating-point data format. Then, floating-point simulation of the assembly program is conducted not only for verifying the program but also for estimating the range of each internal variable. This program is then automatically translated into a fixed-point version. The scaling that is needed for the conversion of floating-point variables and data to fixed-point counterparts is conducted based on the range of the signal being processed. Since the floating-point program is executed after being converted to a fixed-point version, the execution speed is not sacrificed. In addition, the implementation result shows a higher SQNR than that employing conventional scaling approaches because scaling is conducted based on the statistics of a real signal. Therefore, this software provides the convenience of floating-point programming without sacrificing the advantages of fixed-point digital signal processors. Application examples for a fourth-order IIR filter, Levinson-Durbin's recursion, and an FFT routine are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A floating-point to fixed-point assembly program translator for the TMS 320C25","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/82.331543","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/7835/00331543.pdf","startPage":"730","endPage":"739","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.331543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7835","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=331543","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/331543/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"A floating-point to fixed-point assembly program translator for the TMS 320C25","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4833173","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A floating-point to fixed-point assembly program translator for the TMS 320C25","sourcePdf":"00331543.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03331S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"25","articleId":"331543","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":331544,"authors":[{"name":"M.B.

It has been shown that discrete-time fading-memory systems can be uniformly approximated arbitrarily closely over a set of bounded input sequences simply by uniformly approximating sufficiently closely either the external or internal representation of the system. In other words, the problem of uniformly approximating a fading-memory system reduces to the problem of uniformly approximating continuous real-valued functions on compact sets. The perceptron is a parametric model that realizes a set of continuous real-valued functions that is uniformly dense in the set of all continuous real-valued functions. Using the perceptron to uniformly approximate the external and internal representations of a discrete-time fading-memory system results, respectively, in simple finite-memory and infinite-memory parametric system models.

As compared to a bit-parallel hybrid realization method described recently, the proposed bit-serial one does not need to broadcast input data to the processing elements used and reduces the table-look-up memory in each module processor from (B+2/sup upper bound [log(2/N])-1)/spl middot/B/spl middot/2/sup 2B/ bits to B/spl middot/2/sup 2B/ bits, where B is the wordlength of each modulus and N is the number of filter coefficients.

The design objective was to minimize the orthosis complexity, defined as the number of degrees of freedom, while maintaining the ability to perform specific tasks. This objective was achieved in three stages. First, potential users of a powered orthosis were interviewed to determine their priority tasks. Secondly, the natural arm motions of able-bodied individuals performing the priority tasks were profiled using a video tracking system. Finally, a kinematic simulation algorithm was developed and employed in order to evaluate whether a proposed orthosis configuration could perform the priority tasks. The research results indicate that task functionality is overly compromised for orthosis configurations with less than five degrees of freedom, plus prehension. Acceptable task performance, based on the specific priority tasks considered, was achieved in the simulations of two different orthosis configurations with five degrees of freedom. In the first design option, elevation (rotation about a horizontal axis through the shoulder) and radial/ulnar deviation are fixed, while in the second option wrist flexion and radial/ulnar deviation are fixed. A prototype orthosis is currently being developed using the first design option.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/86.331561","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","startPage":"119","endPage":"129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/86.331561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7836","pdfPath":"/iel4/86/7836/00331561.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion analysis","Analytical models","Design methodology","Diseases","Injuries","Orthotics","Tracking","Kinematics","Performance evaluation","Shoulder"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthotics","task analysis","simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["functional task analysis","motion simulation","powered upper-limb orthosis","optimal configuration","orthosis complexity minimization","kinematic simulation algorithm","priority tasks","prehension","wrist flexion","radial/ulnar deviation","able-bodied individuals","natural arm motions","shoulder"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A functional task analysis and motion simulation for the development of a powered upper-limb orthosis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/331561/","volume":"2","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4839238","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A functional task analysis and motion simulation for the development of a powered upper-limb orthosis","sourcePdf":"00331561.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045803S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"86","citationCount":"78","articleId":"331561","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":331562,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In general, a realisation matched to the required rate of these applications exploits only a relatively small part of the parallelism available in the algorithm. This paper addresses the important problem of selecting the appropriate algorithmic-level decisions, in particular loop manipulations and the like, to arrive at an area-optimized specification for use in register-transfer level synthesis tools. One of the crucial cost factors in this optimisation is memory storage related. An effective model and methodology are proposed to derive an optimized architecture with fully matched throughput, while avoiding a full traversal of the large search space.

The new architecture that we call mesh with hybrid buses (MHB) is readily implementable in VLSI with no increase in the area or the wiring complexity of the MMB chip. More importantly, the new architecture affords us an exponential gain in the running time when compared with the MMB. Specifically, with a digital image pretiled onto an MHB of size /spl radic/n/spl times//spl radic/n one pixel per processor we show that the problems of computing the convex hull of the image, computing the diameter and the width of the image, deciding whether two images are linearly separable, computing several moments and low-level descriptors of the image including the perimeter, area, center, and median row of its convex hull can be solved in O(log n) time.

Even though efficient dynamic programming algorithms exist for the problem, when the size of the database is large, the time required is quite long, even for moderate length sequences. In this paper, we present an efficient pipelined SIMD solution to the sequence alignment problem on the Micro-Grain Array Processor (MGAP), a fine-grained massively parallel array of processors with nearest-neighbor connections. The algorithm compares K sequences of length O(M) with the actual sequence of length N, in O(M+N+K) time with O(MN) processors, which is AT-optimal.

Interval arithmetic produces two values for each result, such that the true result is guaranteed to be between the two values. The distance between the two values gives an upper bound on the error. Direct hardware support for variable-precision, interval arithmetic greatly improves the accuracy of the computation, and is much faster than existing software methods for controlling numerical error. Area and delay estimates indicate that the processor can be implemented on a single chip with a cycle time which is comparable to existing IEEE double-precision floating point processors. For computationally intensive problems, an application-specific array of variable-precision, interval arithmetic processors can execute in parallel to provide high-performance and numerically reliable results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00331799.png","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Application Specific Array Processors (ASSAP'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1001/7844/00331799.pdf","startPage":"248","endPage":"258","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Application Specific Array Processors (ASSAP'94)","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.1994.331799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.1994.331799","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7844","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=331799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A variable-precision interval arithmetic processor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital arithmetic","Hardware","Computer errors","Modems","Error correction","Delay estimation","Concurrent computing","Computer languages","Floating-point arithmetic","USA Councils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","error analysis","microprocessor chips","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable-precision interval arithmetic processor","special-purpose processor","hardware support","numerical error","IEEE double-precision floating point processors","application-specific array","parallel arithmetic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/331799/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"A variable-precision interval arithmetic processor","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4790276","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A variable-precision interval arithmetic processor","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00331799.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090775S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug 1994","isNumber":"7844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1001","citationCount":"3","articleId":"331799","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":331810,"authors":[{"name":"Hyesook Lim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Hyesook Lim","id":"37345431800"},{"name":"E.E.

Classical methods for implementing the Hough transform of a N/spl times/N binary image require to compute N/sup 3/ additions over n=log/sub 2/(N) bits integers, hence nN/sup 3/ bit operations per transform. We introduce a new algorithm for computing the fast Hough transform FHT which only requires log/sub 2/(N)/spl times/N/sup 2/ additions, for a total of n/sup 2/N/sup 2/ bit operations per transform. The method is based on a recursive algorithm for raster-scan line drawing, which is different from Bresenham's iterative one The FHT has a divide and conquer recursive structure similar to that of the classical fast Fourier transform FFT algorithm, with simpler atomic operations-additions over n bits numbers-and a more complex interconnect. The FHT algorithm can readily be implemented in software. It maps into hardware as well, and we detail the structure of a bit-serial circuit for computing the FHT.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.1994.331821","pdfPath":"/iel2/1001/7844/00331821.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Application Specific Array Processors (ASSAP'94)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Application Specific Array Processors (ASSAP'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.1994.331821","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast linear Hough transform","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/331821/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"Fast linear Hough transform","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4790254","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast linear Hough transform","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00331821.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026447S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug 1994","isNumber":"7844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1001","citationCount":"9","articleId":"331821","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":331842,"authors":[{"name":"W.S.

Using our approaches to do logic optimization for lookup-table based FPGAs, we obtain a good starting point for technology mapping. On the basis of 25 benchmark examples, our optimized circuits require 14% fewer configurable logic blocks (CLBs) than the circuits optimized by MIS-II if both are subsequently mapped using MIS-pga.

PRISC create application-specific instructions to accelerate the performance for a particular application. Our previous work has demonstrated that peephole optimizations in a compiler can utilize PFU resources to accelerate the performance of general purpose programs. However these compiler optimizations are limited by the structure of the input source code. This work generalizes on our previous work, and demonstrates that the performance of general abstract data types such as short-set vectors, hash tables, and finite state machines is significantly accelerated (250%-500%) by using PFU resources. Thus, a wide variety of end-user applications can be specifically designed to use PFU resources to accelerate performance. Results from applications in the domain of computer-aided design (CAD) are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of our techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1994.331875","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1994 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1994 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors","pdfPath":"/iel2/1002/7845/00331875.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.1994.331875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7845","startPage":"145","endPage":"149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PRISC software acceleration techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=331875","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PRISC software acceleration techniques","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/331875/","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4801055","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PRISC software acceleration techniques","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00331875.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050769S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct 1994","isNumber":"7845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1002","citationCount":"20","articleId":"331875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":331882,"authors":[{"name":"S.

An important part of designing such a system is determining the proper routing topology to use to interconnect the FPGAs. This topology can have a great effect on the area and delay of the resulting system. Tree, bipartite graph, and mesh inter-connection schemes have all been proposed for use in FPGA-based systems. In this paper we examine mesh interconnection schemes, and propose several constructs for more efficient topologies. These reduce inter-chip delays by more than 60% over the basic 4-way Mesh.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1994 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1994 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors","pdfPath":"/iel2/1002/7845/00331882.pdf","startPage":"170","endPage":"177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mesh routing topologies for multi-FPGA systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1994.331882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7845","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.1994.331882","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=331882","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/331882/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Mesh routing topologies for multi-FPGA systems","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4801060","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mesh routing topologies for multi-FPGA systems","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00331882.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065979S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct 1994","isNumber":"7845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1002","citationCount":"12","articleId":"331882","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":331883,"authors":[{"name":"N.

An abstract model to investigate the area and delay of field programmable gate array architectures is presented. The model is used to show that a system implemented on FPGAs will require as much as 100 times more die area than its custom VLSI implementation and would be about 10 times slower. Our analysis shows that this high cost, inherent to the current FPGA-based architectures, is a severe limitation to virtual hardware development.

To realize high performance of processing a series of memory data such as a frame buffer and a character-string, we have used block-data-transfer and 64-bit processing to improve execution efficiency of multiple-operation instructions of the processor. 16-byte block read/write operations through a 32-bit external data bus have accomplished high bandwidth for DRAM access, even in the case of non-cacheable regions such as a frame buffer. In executing multiple-operation instructions, 64-bit processing has been realized by operating the dual execution circuits for superscalar executions and a 64-bit internal data bus under the control of a very long micro-instruction word.

Substantial power servings can be realized if 5 V designs are translated to use the new lower supply voltage standards. This conversion, however is not achieved easily: a design originally targeted for implementation in a 5 V technology will typically require significant re-work to meet timing and throughput requirements at the lower operating voltage. We describe a high-level synthesis system which assists the designer in performing this task, minimizing the need for manual re-design. Techniques employed in this work include pipelining and a new approach to module selection which minimizes power consumption subject to timing constraints. Using these and other high-level synthesis techniques to target designs to 3.3 V libraries, we show that it is possible to reduce power consumption by as much as 56% as compared to the original 5 V implementation, while meeting specified minimum throughput and maximum latency constraints.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1994.331916","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1994 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1994 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors","pdfPath":"/iel2/1002/7845/00331916.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.1994.331916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7845","startPage":"323","endPage":"326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microarchitectural synthesis of performance-constrained, low-power VLSI designs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=331916","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Microarchitectural synthesis of performance-constrained, low-power VLSI designs","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/331916/","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4801086","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microarchitectural synthesis of performance-constrained, low-power VLSI designs","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00331916.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047531S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct 1994","isNumber":"7845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1002","citationCount":"29","articleId":"331916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":331942,"authors":[{"name":"D.R.

Results are plotted on to a response contour map, indicating a point of maximum area density.

This method uses wire-sizing to meet the electrical damping criteria to propagate high-speed signals through unterminated lossy transmission lines on the substrates of multichip modules. Based on an improved scattering-parameters (S-parameters) macro-model of transmission lines, wire-sizing optimal design method relates the layout parameter (line width) and the transfer function (damping ratio, and natural undamped frequency) to the signal propagation delay. The optimal design method results in fast and stable signal propagation for single-source multi-receiver networks on multichip modules without using termination resistors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1994.331984","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.1994.331984","startPage":"594","endPage":"598","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1994 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors","pdfPath":"/iel2/1002/7845/00331984.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1994 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7845","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal design of self-damped lossy transmission lines for multichip modules","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Optimal design of self-damped lossy transmission lines for multichip modules","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 1994","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4801138","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/331984/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal design of self-damped lossy transmission lines for multichip modules","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00331984.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038437S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct 1994","isNumber":"7845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1002","citationCount":"13","articleId":"331984","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":331985,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The optimal differential routing technique relies on routing signal pairs as logical nets and bifurcating the results to achieve a physical realization. Based on our research, CIF (Caltech. Interchange Format) has emerged as the ideal medium for the bifurcation process associated with differential routing of MCMs. Since MCMs have not as yet fully come of age, many of their design variables are under constrained. One of the greatest strengths of our finding is CIF's ability to handle the design uncertainty associated with current MCM system development, where both package and chip specification are typically in a tremendous state of flux throughout the engineering design cycle.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential routing of MCMs-CIF: the ideal bifurcation medium","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1994 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1994.331985","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1994 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors","pdfPath":"/iel2/1002/7845/00331985.pdf","startPage":"599","endPage":"603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.1994.331985","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7845","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=331985","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/331985/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Differential routing of MCMs-CIF: the ideal bifurcation medium","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4801139","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential routing of MCMs-CIF: the ideal bifurcation medium","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00331985.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027762S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct 1994","isNumber":"7845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1002","citationCount":"4","articleId":"331985","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":332050,"authors":[{"name":"T.

As gas detecting devices semiconductor gas sensors with partially overlapping selectivity have been used. Because of the low selectivity of semiconductor gas sensors, one gas sensor alone can give no accurate statement concerning type of gas and the actual concentration. Applying an array of semiconductor gas sensors in combination with Kohonen feature map (KFM) neural networks, unknown species of gases can be identified and quantified if the gas sensor system has been calibrated with this sort of gas earlier. The influence of different network parameters, e.g. the number of nodes in the network or the number of pattern vectors used to train the KFM have been studied.

This approach is particularly noteworthy as it is implemented using less than 3 V dc and precludes the need for negative gate voltages making it attractive for use in wireless applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Microwave and Millimeter-Wave Monolithic Circuits Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/1082/7847/00332134.pdf","startPage":"99","endPage":"102","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Microwave and Millimeter-Wave Monolithic Circuits Symposium","doi":"10.1109/MCS.1994.332134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCS.1994.332134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7847","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=332134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel MMIC biphase modulator with variable gain using enhancement-mode FETS suitable for 3 V wireless applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MMICs","Gain","FETs","Circuits","Voltage","Frequency","Binary phase shift keying","Phase modulation","Bandwidth","Parasitic capacitance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency response","phase shift keying","modulators","field effect integrated circuits","microwave amplifiers","MMIC","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MMIC biphase modulator","variable gain","enhancement-mode FETS","wireless applications","circuit topology","BPSK","physically small circuit","enhancement mode MESFETs","upper frequency response","1.7 GHz","3 V"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/332134/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 May 1994","displayDocTitle":"A novel MMIC biphase modulator with variable gain using enhancement-mode FETS suitable for 3 V wireless applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4789657","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"22-25 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel MMIC biphase modulator with variable gain using enhancement-mode FETS suitable for 3 V wireless applications","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00332134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034394S","chronDate":"22-25 May 1994","isNumber":"7847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1082","citationCount":"20","articleId":"332134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":332141,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The K/N neural networks have important potential application in such areas as pattern recognition and image processing. The proposed model is applied to pattern recognition, like the decimal digits in presence of random noise, and comparison is made with its analog counter part perception model. The results show that the K/N net performs better than the perceptron net. The advantages of the proposed model over the analog model are reported as follows: 1) no time consuming training is needed; 2) the desired pattern can be easily distinguished from possible noise inputs given the fact that the distance between the two has been predetermined and included in the design; and 3) the implementation can be achieved with memory and register architecture.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1993.332189","startPage":"481","endPage":"485 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.1993.332189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7848","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel2/1086/7848/00332189.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new digital neural network and its application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/332189/","displayDocTitle":"A new digital neural network and its application","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4794625","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-17 Sept. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Sep 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new digital neural network and its application","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00332189.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044014S","chronDate":"14-17 Sep 1993","isNumber":"7848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1086","citationCount":"1","articleId":"332189","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":332190,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangui Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Windsor, Windsor, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Xiangui Yu","id":"37087453961"},{"name":"N.K.

Transforming neuron activation functions are used in all the hidden layers, which are the modified continuous sigmoidal functions with an adaptive steepness factors. In the training process, this steepness factor varies from a small positive value to infinite with the decrease of the sum square error. Thus, a multilayer feedforward neural network can be trained with the resultant architecture only composed of hard limiting neurons. The learning algorithm is similar to the conventional backpropagation algorithm. Only the derivatives of the hidden neural activation functions are modified. Extensive numerical simulations are presented to show the feasibility of the proposed algorithm.

As a special case covered by the model introduced, we employ a quadratic relation similar to that found in practical MOS devices to implement synapses in ANN. A simulator is developed to account for the activity of synapses and to apply additional constraints for bounded weights. Application of one particular version of quadratic synapses has been examined, and positive results are shown both for the simulation of logical functions of two variables, and the detection of characters on a 3/spl times/5 retina. Also a geometrical interpretation is derived, which emphasizes that this approach has significant advantages if utilized in nonlinear pattern-recognition problems regardless of its hardware implementation convenience.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1993.332192","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00332192.png","startPage":"469","endPage":"472 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel2/1086/7848/00332192.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.1993.332192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7848","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized artificial neural networks (GANN)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Hardware","Neurons","Very large scale integration","Software algorithms","CMOS technology","Retina","Software systems","Energy consumption","Analog computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural chips","VLSI","integrated logic circuits","MOS integrated circuits","character recognition","feedforward neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized neural networks","VLSI implementation","simulator","bounded weights","quadratic synapses","geometrical interpretation","nonlinear pattern recognition","localized storage parameters","logical functions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/332192/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"Generalized artificial neural networks (GANN)","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-17 Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4794622","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized artificial neural networks (GANN)","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00332192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092808S","chronDate":"14-17 Sep 1993","isNumber":"7848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1086","citationCount":"2","articleId":"332192","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":332193,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Also the estimated error of five percent in the propagation delay in the uplink causes a further 1 dB loss.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel2/1086/7848/00332200.pdf","startPage":"417","endPage":"423 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1993.332200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.1993.332200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7848","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=332200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Global synchronization of a FDMA/TDM processing satellite communication system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency division multiaccess","Time division multiplexing","Frequency synchronization","Bit error rate","Timing jitter","Master-slave","Satellite ground stations","Satellite communication","Computer simulation","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronisation","satellite links","frequency division multiple access","time division multiplexing","Markov processes","error statistics","radiowave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDMA/TDM processing satellite communication system","global synchronization system","Earth terminal","symbol timing recovery techniques","Markov chain model","bit error rate","downlink","uplink","timing jitter","random noise","clock frequency offset","system performance","propagation delay"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/332200/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"Global synchronization of a FDMA/TDM processing satellite communication system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4794614","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-17 Sept. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global synchronization of a FDMA/TDM processing satellite communication system","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00332200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038522S","chronDate":"14-17 Sep 1993","isNumber":"7848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1086","articleId":"332200","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":332201,"authors":[{"name":"L.J.

This intelligent interface relieves the user from tidy typing of DOS commands. This task necessitates the users independent recognition of the spoken commands and interfacing them with the operating system shell. Traditional speech recognition techniques are not capable of extracting significant features and are not able to generalize. These problems are conveniently solved with neural network techniques. The paper introduces the application of a three layer neural network for classification of DOS commands. A supervised learning method which is based on the back propagation technique is described. A training set including different patterns for each command recorded under different conditions, is first preprocessed, and then spotted to guarantee invariance under translation in time. Since the learning phase of a neural network based classifier is a time consuming task, it was necessary to use a data reduction technique which can preserve the command information. A linear prediction technique is used to achieve a high degree of data reduction. Only nine linear prediction coefficients are proved to be sufficient for discrimination of DOS commands. The experimental results for the neural classifier indicated a high percentage of correct classification for a training set including twelve DOS commands. The most effective number of units in the hidden layer and the value of the learning rate are conducted through extensive experimental work.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1993.332226","startPage":"100","endPage":"103 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.1993.332226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7848","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel2/1086/7848/00332226.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network speech interface with the DOS commander","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/332226/","displayDocTitle":"A neural network speech interface with the DOS commander","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4794588","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-17 Sept. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Sep 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network speech interface with the DOS commander","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00332226.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035026S","chronDate":"14-17 Sep 1993","isNumber":"7848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1086","articleId":"332226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":332229,"authors":[{"name":"B.K.

The database of handwritten digits used for this study was also used by a group at the University of Windsor. The neural network that receives the most attention is a hierarchical multi-layered network. The architecture of this network was originally proposed by a group at AT&T Bell Labs, however the authors use different training algorithms and a different dataset. Preprocessing of the digit data was minimal; the networks learned to extract the relevant features of the input. With the hierarchical network, the training data (about 2000 digits) were consistently learned almost perfectly. The percentage of test patterns (another 2000 digits) rejected as unclassifiable (uncertain) to obtain 1% error on the remaining (classifiable) test patterns ranged from 10.6 to 11.8%. These generalization performances compare favorably to Bell Labs' result on a different dataset, of 12.0% rejections. It was found that an elaborate conjugate gradient minimization technique yielded little improvement in generalization performance and resulted in six times longer training time than ordinary backpropagation. The authors show that the neural networks were also able to extract meaningful features of the digits, such as edges. Some additional simulation results are reported that show the importance of using a hierarchical network: both a simple two-layered network and a cascade correlation network yielded inferior results. The cascade correlation network was the least successful, possibly because the network was committing itself to poor results early on in training when few hidden units were present.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1993.332229","startPage":"88","endPage":"91 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.1993.332229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7848","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel2/1086/7848/00332229.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Handwritten digit feature extraction and classification using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/332229/","displayDocTitle":"Handwritten digit feature extraction and classification using neural networks","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4794585","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-17 Sept. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Sep 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Handwritten digit feature extraction and classification using neural networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00332229.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070369S","chronDate":"14-17 Sep 1993","isNumber":"7848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1086","citationCount":"1","articleId":"332229","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":332232,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.

The proposed power supply provides input waveforms that are nearly sinusoidal, fast control of the DC load current, and feedforward unity power factor correction for different load conditions.

Existing methods of contingency ranking methods suffer from masking effects in approximate methods and slow execution in more accurate ranking methods. In an effort to improve this situation, this paper proposes a fast contingency screening scheme using an Extended Hopfield Neural Network (EHN). This scheme is based on a novel formulation of the contingency ranking problem as a combinatorial optimization problem for efficient solution by the EHN. Because of the recent advances in problem mapping methods, this formulation results in accurate model codification free from trial and error and elimination of local minima problems encountered by previous Hopfield network schemes. The application results of the proposed EHN scheme to three sample systems are presented. The ranking performance is compared with other methods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1993.332291","startPage":"199","endPage":"204 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.1993.332291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7848","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel2/1086/7848/00332291.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast contingency screening through optimizing Hopfield neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/332291/","displayDocTitle":"Fast contingency screening through optimizing Hopfield neural networks","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4823583","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-17 Sept. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Sep 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast contingency screening through optimizing Hopfield neural networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00332291.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063333S","chronDate":"14-17 Sep 1993","isNumber":"7848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1086","citationCount":"2","articleId":"332291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":332292,"authors":[{"name":"T.S.

The neural controller, in the on line mode has the ability to learn from experience, thus eliminating the need for a priori knowledge of the system dynamics. The neural network can adapt to variations in the load, and still allow the system to track a specific reference without redesign.

We extend this method to the problem of permutation decoding of binary cyclic codes and give an implementation based on a Hopfield type neural network architecture. Using results from Baldi (1988), we show that a generalized Hopfield network whose connections are governed by the generator matrix of the code and the received word has a stable state corresponding to the transmitted codeword if t=[(d-1)/2] or fewer errors are introduced in the transmission process. An energy function is defined and the search for a global maxima is done through a selective updating of neurons( information bits). The value of the energy function call be related to the Hamming distance of the received word and to the codeword corresponding to the current state of the network so that if we come within the Hamming sphere of a codeword, successful decoding has been achieved. By utilizing the known permutation group of the code, the local maxima problem which plagues all optimization search is alleviated. We discuss the conditions under which the network will converge to the right codeword in the presence of random errors as well as various updating algorithms. Finally we conclude with simulation results for non-trivial cyclic codes such as the (63,30,13), the (127,64,2) and the (255,131,37) BCH codes using different approaches to searching the energy space.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gradient descent decoding of binary cyclic codes","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1993.332303","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel2/1086/7848/00332303.pdf","startPage":"253","endPage":"254 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.1993.332303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7848","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=332303","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/332303/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"Gradient descent decoding of binary cyclic codes","conferenceDate":"14-17 Sept. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4823595","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gradient descent decoding of binary cyclic codes","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00332303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026863S","chronDate":"14-17 Sep 1993","isNumber":"7848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1086","articleId":"332303","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":332306,"authors":[{"name":"A.D.

The new ANN-based short term load forecast (STLF) model was tested using two month data sample of the Singapore Public Utilities Board (PUB) historical data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1993.332322","startPage":"325","endPage":"328 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel2/1086/7848/00332322.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.1993.332322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7848","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network based short term load forecasting model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Load forecasting","Load modeling","Predictive models","Artificial neural networks","Technology forecasting","Weather forecasting","SCADA systems","Data preprocessing","Niobium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system analysis computing","digital simulation","load forecasting","feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short term load forecasting model","feedforward two layer neural network","hourly load","quantitative weight assignment priority factors","forecast vector","computer simulation","scaled historical load data","training","cross correlation","FFT spectra","Singapore"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/332322/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"A neural network based short term load forecasting model","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-17 Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4823614","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network based short term load forecasting model","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00332322.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043044S","chronDate":"14-17 Sep 1993","isNumber":"7848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1086","citationCount":"2","articleId":"332322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":332323,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

Rather than storing individual members of the training sets, a method for storing representatives of the sets is considered. Representatives of sets are stored by calculating a connection matrix such that all the elements in a training set are attracted to members of the same training set. An arbitrary element is then classified by the class of its attractor if the attractor is a member of one of the original training sets. The elements themselves are not required to be attractors. The method is successfully applied to artificially generated classes and to the classification of cervical cells for cancer detection. The algorithms are coded in a language called APL for rapid prototyping. The language limits the size of the networks, however, when implemented on a microcomputer. Given these constraints the execution times were nevertheless small due to the few number of epochs required to store the sets.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Sep 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/332325/","accessionNumber":"4823617","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-17 Sept. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Using the Hopfield neural network as a classifier by storing class representatives","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using the Hopfield neural network as a classifier by storing class representatives","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00332325.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027761S","chronDate":"14-17 Sep 1993","isNumber":"7848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1086","citationCount":"3","articleId":"332325","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":332338,"authors":[{"name":"K.R.

Given a set of unstructured points sampled from a curve in an image, we consider the problem estimating orientation, i.e. finding tangent direction (or equivalently normal direction), at each point. The points are discrete samples of curves, and can be perturbated severely by noise. Hoppe et al. (1992) suggests the use of the covariance matrix, constructed from a k-neighborhood of a point x, to estimate the orientation at x. A problem with this approach is the fixed k value, which imposes implicitly a very restrictive condition on the density of sampled points in order to work properly. To solve this problem, we present a multi-scale method for reliable estimation of orientation and curvature for a set of unstructured points. Furthermore, we derive a structural representation for the point set.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7848","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.1993.332349","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00332349.png","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel2/1086/7848/00332349.pdf","startPage":"527","endPage":"530 vol.1","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1993.332349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-scale orientation estimation for unstructured sample points","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"Multi-scale orientation estimation for unstructured sample points","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 Sept. 1993","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4799758","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/332349/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-scale orientation estimation for unstructured sample points","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00332349.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063495S","chronDate":"14-17 Sep 1993","isNumber":"7848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1086","citationCount":"1","articleId":"332349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":332380,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This is mainly because linear modulation schemes are more spectrally efficient than constant envelope modulation schemes such as Gaussian minimum shift keying modulation (GMSK). The increasing demand for spectrum resources has also motivated interest in using coherent demodulation. We analyze the performance of QPSK in the presence of cochannel interference. Three approaches that can be used for analysing the cochannel interference are investigated. These are a precise method based on the average probability of error, a sum of sinusoids (sinusoidal) model, and a Gaussian interference model. The system performance is assessed in terms of the average bit error rate. The examples consider the outdoor microcellular fading environment. In this environment, the fading experienced by the interfering signals may be represented by a Rayleigh fading model while the fading experienced by the desired signal may be represented by a Ricean or a Nakagami fading model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1993.332401","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel2/1086/7848/00332401.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.1993.332401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7848","startPage":"733","endPage":"737 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error rates of Nyquist-shaped QPSK in cochannel interference and fading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=332401","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Error rates of Nyquist-shaped QPSK in cochannel interference and fading","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Sep 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/332401/","conferenceDate":"14-17 Sept. 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4811727","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error rates of Nyquist-shaped QPSK in cochannel interference and fading","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00332401.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032028S","chronDate":"14-17 Sep 1993","isNumber":"7848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1086","articleId":"332401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":332402,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The discretization of Slotine and Li's (1987, 1988) direct adaptive control algorithm results in a sampled-data system for which stability has not been guaranteed. By formulating the entire sampled-data system in continuous-time, Lyapunov's direct method is used to examine the stability bounds. A proposed nonlinear discrete-time compensating term is added to Slotine and Li's adaptive algorithm, to stabilize the sampled-data system. For sufficiently high gain, globally stable performance and a known bound on the norm of the filtered error is proven. A multi-rate discrete-time controller implementation of the compensated adaptive controller is investigated. The stabilizing effect of the compensator is demonstrated through simulation of a 2 degree-of-freedom serial link manipulator.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1993.332428","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.1993.332428","startPage":"845","endPage":"850 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel2/1086/7848/00332428.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7848","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compensation of sampled-data robot adaptive controllers for improved stability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"Compensation of sampled-data robot adaptive controllers for improved stability","conferenceDate":"14-17 Sept. 1993","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4800499","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/332428/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compensation of sampled-data robot adaptive controllers for improved stability","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00332428.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028767S","chronDate":"14-17 Sep 1993","isNumber":"7848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1086","citationCount":"1","articleId":"332428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":332467,"authors":[{"name":"D.

These devices have DC gains greater than 100 with about 0.3 /spl mu/W input power and breakdown voltages V/sub br/ of 56 V. At 0.9 V/sub br/, the dark current is typically 10 nA for a 30-/spl mu/m-diameter active area device. The theoretical calculations of dark currents indicates that the primary dark currents come from generation-recombination and diffusion currents in both active and periphery regions. The breakdown voltage is in agreement with the calculation, which shows that the partial charge sheet does prevent the premature breakdown in the periphery region. The shot noise power is determined to be proportional to I/sup 2.7/, in agreement with theory. The lack of 1/f noise indicates the partial charge sheet is a good design to replace conventional guard ring design.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1993.332488","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel2/1086/7848/00332488.pdf","startPage":"1270","endPage":"1273 vol.2","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00332488.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.1993.332488","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7848","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DC and noise characteristics of InP-based avalanche photodiodes for optical communication applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=332488","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Sep 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/332488/","displayDocTitle":"DC and noise characteristics of InP-based avalanche photodiodes for optical communication applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4805790","conferenceDate":"14-17 Sept. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DC and noise characteristics of InP-based avalanche photodiodes for optical communication applications","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00332488.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057056S","chronDate":"14-17 Sep 1993","isNumber":"7848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1086","citationCount":"3","articleId":"332488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":332492,"authors":[{"name":"H.M.

This paper presents an effective detector, which can be considered as a two-dimensional feature matching filter for radar signals. The feature extraction is performed by Hopfield neural networks and the feature integration is finished by a multilayer perceptron. In order to overcome the local optimum problem, a novel modification which is called energy comparing method is introduced into the Hopfield model dynamic equation to find the global optimum. By testing with the real radar return data in a low signal-to-clutter ratio, the detector presented in this paper has more advantages than the conventional threshold detector.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/NAECON.1994.332926","startPage":"1052","endPage":"1058 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of National Aerospace and Electronics Conference (NAECON'94)","pdfPath":"/iel4/1123/7851/00332926.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of National Aerospace and Electronics Conference (NAECON'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAECON.1994.332926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7851","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The neural network method for radar weak target detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Object detection","Radar detection","Detectors","Radar clutter","Matched filters","Feature extraction","Hopfield neural networks","Multilayer perceptrons","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal detection","radar clutter","feature extraction","encoding","Hopfield neural nets","filtering and prediction theory","feedforward neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar weak target detection","threshold detector","effective detector","two-dimensional feature matching filter","radar signals","feature extraction","Hopfield neural networks","feature integration","multilayer perceptron","local optimum problem","energy comparing method","Hopfield model dynamic equation","global optimum","real radar return data","signal-to-clutter ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/332926/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 May 1994","displayDocTitle":"The neural network method for radar weak target detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-27 May 1994","accessionNumber":"4790563","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The neural network method for radar weak target detection","confLoc":"Dayton, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00332926.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046457S","chronDate":"23-27 May 1994","isNumber":"7851","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1123","articleId":"332926","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":332978,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The main thrust of these experiments focus on: (1) investigating effective configuration of classes of GA operators; (2) determining GA operator parameter settings that will produce \"near-optimal\" routes; (3) exploring the use of a domain-specific mutation operator, called \"target bias mutation\", for expediting convergence; and (4) comparing results against the well-known dynamic programming algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/NAECON.1994.333010","startPage":"111","endPage":"118 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of National Aerospace and Electronics Conference (NAECON'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAECON.1994.333010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7851","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of National Aerospace and Electronics Conference (NAECON'94)","pdfPath":"/iel4/1123/7851/00333010.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicle route planning with constraints using genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/333010/","displayDocTitle":"Vehicle route planning with constraints using genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4790200","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-27 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 May 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicle route planning with constraints using genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Dayton, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00333010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026365S","chronDate":"23-27 May 1994","isNumber":"7851","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1123","citationCount":"10","articleId":"333010","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":333013,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the problems of three-dimensional path planning in the context of a point-like airplane traveling to avoid circular danger regions. We will explore two distinct problems. The first problem is how to plan a path when the locations of all the dangers are known. The solution to this problem gives the plane an optimal path to follow before it even leaves the ground. We will refer to this as the global path planning case. In the second problem, the locations of the dangers are not known in advance. Instead, the locations of the danger points are known to the plane when they are within a sensor range, The plane changes its path when it senses the danger areas. We will refer to the second problem as the dynamic path planning case. Both of these cases will be subject to turning constraints. For the global path planning case, the problem can be solved with Collins decomposition. The dynamic path planning case, however, is still open ended. This paper outlines several approaches and their pitfalls concluding with subgoal avoidance as a solution for particular classes of reconnaissance scenarios.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/NAECON.1994.333013","startPage":"105","endPage":"108 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of National Aerospace and Electronics Conference (NAECON'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAECON.1994.333013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7851","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of National Aerospace and Electronics Conference (NAECON'94)","pdfPath":"/iel4/1123/7851/00333013.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Path planning problems and solutions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/333013/","displayDocTitle":"Path planning problems and solutions","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4790198","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-27 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 May 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Path planning problems and solutions","confLoc":"Dayton, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00333013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043585S","chronDate":"23-27 May 1994","isNumber":"7851","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1123","citationCount":"18","articleId":"333013","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":333089,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The key feature of the model is the use of a modified form of the transfer matrix method resulting in a time-dependent implementation of this technique. Other features are the inclusion of longitudinal spatial hole burning and nonlinear gain in the model. The versatility of the model is demonstrated in an analysis of the response of a two-electrode DFB laser under large-signal direct current modulation which illustrates the important role played by longitudinal spatial hole burning. The limited use of wavelength tunability in controlling chirp is also demonstrated. However, a scheme to improve the damping mechanism through nonuniform excitation called backbiasing is proposed. Finally, wavelength switching is demonstrated using the model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/3.333696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7856","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.333696","endPage":"2466","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00333696.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/7856/00333696.pdf","startPage":"2458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A transfer matrix method based large-signal dynamic model for multielectrode DFB lasers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/333696/","displayDocTitle":"A transfer matrix method based large-signal dynamic model for multielectrode DFB lasers","volume":"30","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"4836877","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A transfer matrix method based large-signal dynamic model for multielectrode DFB lasers","sourcePdf":"00333696.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032189S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"58","articleId":"333696","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":333699,"authors":[{"name":"P.

It varied strongly with applied bias. Effective chirp parameter, defined as the ratio of phase change to transmission change between modulator on and off states, is about zero, or even negative. However, experimental transmission length on standard fiber at 10 Gb/s NRZ is much smaller than what is expected for such a low chirp parameter. It is demonstrated that the effective chirp parameter should not be computed from changes between on and off states, but from the average of the chirp parameter values in a 3 dB region of the most transparent states of the modulator. This simple rule allows us to predict transmission performances based on measurements of the chirp parameter, and can be used to optimize optical components without actually experimenting on a transmission system. The effective chirp parameter of the MQW electroabsorption modulator is found positive. This should be intrinsic to red-shift electroabsorption effects, such as the quantum confined Stark effect.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/333708/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","volume":"30","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4836889","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","displayDocTitle":"On the transmission performances and the chirp parameter of a multiple-quantum-well electroabsorption modulator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the transmission performances and the chirp parameter of a multiple-quantum-well electroabsorption modulator","sourcePdf":"00333708.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047469S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"59","articleId":"333708","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":333716,"authors":[{"name":"D.S.

This paper first provides a uniform treatment of a general class of optical interconnects based on a Fourier-plane imaging system with an array of sources in the object plane and an array of receptors in the image plane. Sources correspond to data outputs of processing \"cells,\" and receptors to their data inputs. A general abstract optical imaging model, capable of representing a large class of real systems, is analyzed to yield constructive upper bounds on system volume that are comparable to those arising from \"3-D VLSI\" computational models. These bounds, coupled with technologically derived constraints, form the heart of a design methodology for optoelectronic systems that uses electronic and optical elements each to their greatest advantage, and exploits the available spatial volume and power in the most efficient way. Many of these concepts are embodied in a demonstration project that seeks to implement a bit-serial, multiprocessing system with a radix-2 butterfly topology, and incorporates various new technology developments.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/333741/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1994","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4838656","volume":"82","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optoelectronic integrated systems based on free-space interconnects with an arbitrary degree of space variance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optoelectronic integrated systems based on free-space interconnects with an arbitrary degree of space variance","sourcePdf":"00333741.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099063S","chronDate":"Nov.  1994","isNumber":"7857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"21","articleId":"333741","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":333742,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This progress has, in turn, led to the construction of several free-space digital optical system demonstrators. The first was an optical master-slave flip-flop using Hughes liquid-crystal light valves as optical logic gates and computer-generated holograms as the gate-to-gate interconnects. This was demonstrated at USC in 1984. Since then there have been numerous demonstrations of free-space digital optical systems including a simple optical computing system (1990) and five switching fabrics designated System/sub 1/ (1988), System/sub 2/ (1989), System/sub 3/ (1990), System/sub 4/ (1991) and System/sub 5/ (1993). The main focus of this paper will be to describe the five switching fabric demonstrators constructed by AT&T in Naperville, IL. The paper will begin with an overview of the SEED technology which was the device platform used by the demonstrators. This will be followed by a discussion of the architecture, optics, and optomechanics developed for each of the five demonstrators.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7857","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/7857/00333743.pdf","doi":"10.1109/5.333743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.333743","startPage":"1632","endPage":"1649","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Free-space digital optical systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/333743/","displayDocTitle":"Free-space digital optical systems","isJournal":true,"volume":"82","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"4838658","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Free-space digital optical systems","sourcePdf":"00333743.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055283S","chronDate":"Nov.  1994","isNumber":"7857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"56","articleId":"333743","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":333748,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

The prototype system consists of a 16-node input, 4-neuron hidden, and a single-neuron output layer, where the denser input-to-hidden-layer connections are optical. The input layer uses PLZT light modulators to generate optical outputs which are distributed over an optoelectronic neural network chip through space-invariant holographic optical interconnects. Optical interconnections provide negligible fan-out delay and allow compact, purely on-chip electronic H-tree type fan-in structure. The small prototype system achieves a measured 8-bit electronic fan-in precision and a calculated maximum speed of 640 million interconnections per second. The system was tested using synaptic weights learned off system and was shown to distinguish any vertical line from any horizontal one in an image of 4/spl times/4 pixels. New, more efficient light detector and small-area analog synapse circuits and denser optoelectronic neuron layouts are proposed to scale up the system. A high-speed, feed-forward optoelectronic synapse implementation density of up to 10/sup 4//cm/sup 2/ seems feasible using new synapse design. A scaling analysis of the system shows that the optically interconnected neural network implementation can provide higher fan-in speed and lower power consumption characteristics than a purely electronic, crossbar-based neural network implementation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.333752","startPage":"1749","endPage":"1762","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.333752","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7857","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/7857/00333752.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A prototype 3D optically interconnected neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/333752/","displayDocTitle":"A prototype 3D optically interconnected neural network","volume":"82","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4838667","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A prototype 3D optically interconnected neural network","sourcePdf":"00333752.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042708S","chronDate":"Nov.  1994","isNumber":"7857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"14","articleId":"333752","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":333768,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

For a generic function, it is inherently difficult to find the global optimum within a finite number of function evaluations; it is more realistic to talk about maximizing the expectation of the largest function value that can be obtained for a given number of function evaluations. Based on decision theoretic argument, we propose that the search region of the objective function be partitioned into certain number of subregions. Using the sampled function values from each subregion, estimators are derived to determine how \"promising\" each subregion is. The most promising subregion is further partitioned. The proposed adaptive partitioned random search (APRS) is a tree search type of algorithms like branch-and-bound algorithms. The APRS, however, abandons the idea of finding the subregion where the global maximum is likely located in the first place. Instead it seeks the subregion where the largest improvement of the performance is most likely to be obtained if more function evaluations are taken. The APRS in general can provide a much better-than-average solution within a modest number of function evaluations. In fact, our various numerical experiments have shown that in comparison with the crude random search (CRS) in terms of number of function evaluations, the APRS can be at least hundreds of times more efficient. The simplicity and robustness of the APRS in terms of easy implementation and minimum assumptions are also demonstrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Partitioning algorithms","Robustness","Optimization methods","Clustering methods","Simulated annealing","Genetics","Bayesian methods","Clustering algorithms","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["search problems","optimisation","adaptive systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive partitioned random search","global optimization","global maximization","function evaluations","expectation maximization","decision theory","search region partitioning","sampled function values","tree search","branch-and-bound algorithms"]}],"doi":"10.1109/9.333768","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/7858/00333768.pdf","startPage":"2235","endPage":"2244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.333768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive partitioned random search to global optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=333768","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive partitioned random search to global optimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/333768/","volume":"39","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4820581","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive partitioned random search to global optimization","sourcePdf":"00333768.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030341S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"48","articleId":"333768","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":333769,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Arguments are given for the two schools of thought on the origin of 1/f noise. The consequences of models based on carrier-number /spl Delta/N or mobility fluctuations /spl Delta//spl mu/ on the device geometry and on the bias dependence of the 1/f noise are discussed. Circuit-simulation-oriented equations for the 1/f noise are discussed. The effects of scaling down on the 1/f noise is studied in the ohmic region as well as in saturation. In the ohmic region the contribution of the series resistance often can be ignored. However, in saturation the noise of the gate-voltage-dependent series resistance on the drain side plays a role in lightly doped drain LDD mini-MOST's. Surface and bulk p-channel devices are compared and the differences between n-and p-MOST's often observed is discussed. The relation between degradation effects by hot carriers or by /spl gamma/-irradiation on the one hand and the 1/f noise on the other is considered in terms of a /spl Delta/N or /spl Delta//spl mu/. Experimental results suggest that 1/f noise in n-MOST's is dominated by /spl Delta/N while in p-MOST's the noise is due to /spl Delta//spl mu/.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/7859/00333809.pdf","doi":"10.1109/16.333809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.333809","startPage":"1936","endPage":"1945","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"1/f noise in MOS devices, mobility or number fluctuations?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/333809/","displayDocTitle":"1/f noise in MOS devices, mobility or number fluctuations?","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"4826160","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"1/f noise in MOS devices, mobility or number fluctuations?","sourcePdf":"00333809.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071975S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"104","articleId":"333809","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":333811,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

Variations in the room-temperature 1/f noise of unirradiated transistors in the linear regime of device operation correlate strongly with variations in postirradiation threshold-voltage shifts due to oxide trap charge. A simple number fluctuation model has been developed to semi-quantitatively account for this correlation. The 1/f noise of irradiated n-channel MOS transistors increases during irradiation with increasing oxide-trap charge and decreases during postirradiation positive-bias annealing with decreasing oxide-trap charge. No such correlation is found between low-frequency 1/f noise and interface-trap charge. The noise of irradiated p-channel MOS transistors also increases during irradiation, but in contrast to the n-channel response, the p-channel transistor noise magnitude increases during positive-bias annealing with decreasing oxide-trap charge. A qualitative model involving the electrostatic charging and discharging of border traps, as well as accompanying changes in trap energy, is developed to account for this difference in n- and p-channel postirradiation annealing response. The correlation between the low-frequency 1/f noise of unirradiated devices and their postirradiation oxide-trap charge suggests noise measurements can be used as a nondestructive screen of oxide trap charge related failures in discrete MOS devices and for small scale circuits in which critical transistors can be isolated. It also suggests that process techniques developed to reduce radiation-induced-hole trapping in MOS devices can be applied to reduce the low-frequency 1/f noise of MOS circuits and devices. In particular, reducing the number of oxygen vacancies and vacancy complexes in the SiO/sub 2/ can significantly reduce the 1/f noise of MOS devices both in and outside a radiation environment.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.333811","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/7859/00333811.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.333811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859","startPage":"1953","endPage":"1964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"1/f noise and radiation effects in MOS devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=333811","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"1/f noise and radiation effects in MOS devices","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/333811/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4826162","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"1/f noise and radiation effects in MOS devices","sourcePdf":"00333811.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110349S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"143","articleId":"333811","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":333812,"authors":[{"name":"Jimmin Chang","affiliation":["Lattice Semiconductor Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"lastName":"Jimmin Chang","id":"38184372700"},{"name":"A.A.

In this study, it has been shown that V/sub th/ fluctuation (/spl delta/V/sub th/) is mainly caused by the statistical fluctuation of the channel dopant number which explains about 60% of the experimental results. Moreover, we discuss briefly a new scaling scenario, based on the experimental results of the channel length, the gate oxide thickness, and the channel dopant dependence of /spl delta/V/sub th/. Finally, we discuss V/sub th/ fluctuation caused by the independent statistical-variations of two different dopant atoms in the counter ion implantation process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/333844/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","volume":"41","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"4826195","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Experimental study of threshold voltage fluctuation due to statistical variation of channel dopant number in MOSFET's","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental study of threshold voltage fluctuation due to statistical variation of channel dopant number in MOSFET's","sourcePdf":"00333844.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081272S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"434","articleId":"333844","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":333850,"authors":[{"name":"C.N.

It generalizes the Peterson decoding procedure and the procedure of Feng and Tzeng (1991) using nonrecurrent syndrome dependence relations. For a code with actual minimum distance d to correct up to t=[(d-1)/2] errors, the procedure requires a (2t+1)/spl times/(2t+1) syndrome matrix with known syndromes above the minor diagonal and unknown syndromes and their conjugates on the minor diagonal. In contrast to previous procedures, this procedure is primarily aimed at solving for the unknown syndromes instead of determining an error-locator polynomial. Decoding is then accomplished by determining the error vector as the inverse Fourier transform of the syndrome vector (S/sub 0/, S/sub 1/, S/sub n-1/). The authors show that with this procedure, all binary cyclic and BCH codes of length <63 (with one exception) can be decoded up to their actual minimum distance. The procedure incorporates an extension of their fundamental iterative algorithm and a majority scheme for confirming the true values computed for the unknown syndromes. The complexity of this decoding procedure is O(n/sup 3/).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.333854","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.333854","startPage":"1364","endPage":"1374","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/7860/00333854.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7860","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new procedure for decoding cyclic and BCH codes up to actual minimum distance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/333854/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"A new procedure for decoding cyclic and BCH codes up to actual minimum distance","volume":"40","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4820636","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new procedure for decoding cyclic and BCH codes up to actual minimum distance","sourcePdf":"00333854.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029401S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"40","articleId":"333854","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":333858,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Assume that the channel's internal state is drawn at random once every h channel uses, and then remains constant for the following h channel uses. Further assume that the message is short in comparison to h, and that due to delay constraints, the message must be decoded within Nh channel uses, where N need not be large in comparison to the code's constraint length. Such a model is appropriate for describing a convolutionally coded slow frequency hopping system with non-ideal interleaving, in which every frequency is either totally erased or else noiseless. The probability of a message error, the normalized expected number of bits in error, and the bit error rate (BER) are analytically computed for the periodic N/spl times/h bit and word interleavers, where a bit refers to a binary code symbol, and a word refers to a n-tuple of consecutive bits. An analytic expression for the BER is also given for pseudo-random word and bit interleavers and for the corresponding limiting cases of infinite interleaving, i.e., N/spl rarr//spl infin/. As an example for the use of our methods, we analyze the performance of the GSM system with various interleaving depths and methods. We introduce the notion of \"matched\" code and interleaver pairs, and argue that this is a desirable property. Several exhaustive searches are carried out for matched codes and interleavers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.333861","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/7860/00333861.pdf","startPage":"1459","endPage":"1473","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00333861.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.333861","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7860","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The performance of convolutional codes on the block erasure channel using various finite interleaving techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=333861","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/333861/","displayDocTitle":"The performance of convolutional codes on the block erasure channel using various finite interleaving techniques","volume":"40","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4820643","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The performance of convolutional codes on the block erasure channel using various finite interleaving techniques","sourcePdf":"00333861.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038677S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"42","articleId":"333861","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":333866,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

Optimal receiver assumptions allow the inclusion of transmitted waveform specification parameters in the tracking subsystem defining equations. The authors give explicit expressions for two one-step ahead optimization problems for a single target in white Gaussian noise when the tracker is a conventional Kalman filter. These problems may be solved to yield the most improvement possible in tracking performance for each new transmitted pulse. In cases where target motion is restricted to one dimension, closed-form solutions to the local (one step ahead) waveform optimization problem have been obtained. The optimal waveform selection algorithms in the paper may be included with conventional Kalman filtering equations to form an enhanced Kalman tracker. Simulation examples are presented to illustrate the potential of the waveform selection schemes for the optimal utilization of the capabilities of modern digital waveform generators, including multiple waveform classes. The extension of the basic waveform optimization scheme to more complex tracking scenarios is also discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.333866","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"1536","endPage":"1550","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/7860/00333866.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.333866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7860","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal waveform selection for tracking systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Radar tracking","Signal design","System performance","Sensor systems","Sensor arrays","Optimal control","Kalman filters","Signal generators","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal processing","waveform analysis","optimisation","tracking","adaptive filters","Kalman filters","parameter estimation","matrix algebra","white noise","random noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal waveform selection","tracking systems","adaptive waveform selection schemes","optimal receiver assumptions","transmitted waveform specification parameters","tracking subsystem defining equations","one-step ahead optimization problems","white Gaussian noise","conventional Kalman filter","target motion","closed-form solutions","enhanced Kalman tracker","digital waveform generators","multiple waveform classes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Optimal waveform selection for tracking systems","volume":"40","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4820648","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/333866/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal waveform selection for tracking systems","sourcePdf":"00333866.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038376S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"165","articleId":"333866","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":333867,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi-Quan Luo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Zhi-Quan Luo","id":"37279736200"},{"name":"J.N.

When the function f/spl I.oarr/ is linear, they show that these bounds are effectively computable. Certain decentralized estimation problems can be cast in the framework and are discussed in some detail. In particular, the authors consider the case where x and y are random variables representing noisy measurements and f/spl I.oarr/(x,y)=E[z|x,y], where z is a random variable to be estimated. Furthermore, it is established that a standard method for combining decentralized estimates of Gaussian random variables has nearly optimal communication requirements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00333867.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/7860/00333867.pdf","startPage":"1551","endPage":"1563","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.333867","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.333867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7860","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=333867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data fusion with minimal communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random variables","Sensor fusion","Particle measurements","Distributed computing","Complexity theory","Tin","Protocols","Councils","Military computing","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensor fusion","stochastic processes","random processes","parameter estimation","communication complexity","minimisation","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimal communication","data vectors","fusion center","number of messages","decentralized estimation problems","random variables","noisy measurements","Gaussian random variables","communication requirements"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/333867/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Data fusion with minimal communication","volume":"40","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4820649","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data fusion with minimal communication","sourcePdf":"00333867.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054493S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"34","articleId":"333867","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":333868,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This distortion increases with distance from the center of the constellation and limits performance at data rates above 19.2 kb/s. The perimeter distortion can be reduced by transforming the signal constellation so that points near the center are closer together, and points near the perimeter are further apart. When the channel SNR is high, such a transformation reduces immunity to Gaussian noise because points near the center of the transformed constellation are closer together than in a uniformly spaced constellation with the same average power.

This reduces the computational complexity by allowing for fast transform algorithms to perform the modulation for a block of data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.333883","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/7860/00333883.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.333883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7860","startPage":"1645","endPage":"1647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block-based eigensystem of the 1/spl plusmn/D and 1-D/sup 2/ partial response channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=333883","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Block-based eigensystem of the 1/spl plusmn/D and 1-D/sup 2/ partial response channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/333883/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4820663","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block-based eigensystem of the 1/spl plusmn/D and 1-D/sup 2/ partial response channels","sourcePdf":"00333883.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035919S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"1","articleId":"333883","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":333884,"authors":[{"name":"K.

It is shown that such a method can correct t=[(d-1)/2] errors, where d is the true minimum distance of the given cyclic code. The key idea behind this decoding technique is a systematic application of the algorithmic procedures of Grobner bases to obtain the error-locator polynomial L(z). The discussion begins from a set of syndrome polynomials F and the ideal T(F) generated by F. It is proved here that the process of transforming F to the normalized reduced Grobner basis of I(F) with respect to the \"purely lexicographical\" ordering automatically converges to L(z). Furthermore, it is shown that L(z) can be derived from any normalized Grobner basis of I(F) with respect to any admissible total ordering. To illustrate this new approach, the procedures for decoding certain BCH codes and quadratic residue codes are demonstrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.333885","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/7860/00333885.pdf","startPage":"1654","endPage":"1661","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00333885.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.333885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7860","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of Grobner bases to decode binary cyclic codes up to the true minimum distance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Use of Grobner bases to decode binary cyclic codes up to the true minimum distance","volume":"40","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4820666","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/333885/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of Grobner bases to decode binary cyclic codes up to the true minimum distance","sourcePdf":"00333885.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044832S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"37","articleId":"333885","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":333887,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Certain symmetries of the unique quaternary (4,2,3) quadracode are discussed. It is shown how the properties of the Nordstrom-Robinson code itself, such as weight distribution, distance invariance, and the well-known representation as the union of eight cosets of the (16,5,8) Reed-Muller code, may be easily rederived from these symmetries. In addition we introduce a decoding algorithm for the Nordstrom-Robinson code which involves projecting its codewords onto the codewords of the quadracode. The algorithm is simple enough to enable hard-decision decoding of the Nordstrom-Robinson code by hand. Furthermore we present an algorithm for maximum-likelihood soft-decision decoding of the Nordstrom-Robinson code based on its representation over GF(4). The complexity of the proposed algorithm is at most 205 real operations. This is, to the best of our knowledge, less than the complexity of any existing decoder, and twice as efficient as the fast maximum-likelihood decoder of Adoul (1987). We also investigate several related topics, such as bounded-distance decoding, sphere-packings, and the (20,2048,6) code.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7860","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/7860/00333895.pdf","doi":"10.1109/18.333895","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.333895","startPage":"1686","endPage":"1693","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Nordstrom-Robinson code: representation over GF(4) and efficient decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/333895/","displayDocTitle":"The Nordstrom-Robinson code: representation over GF(4) and efficient decoding","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"4820676","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Nordstrom-Robinson code: representation over GF(4) and efficient decoding","sourcePdf":"00333895.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043642S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"19","articleId":"333895","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":333909,"authors":[{"name":"Ching Tsang","affiliation":["IBM Research Division, IBM Advanced Magnetic Recording Laboratory, Almaden Research Center, San Jose, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Ching Tsang","id":"37269110500"},{"name":"R.E.

This paper deals with the extension of the hysteresis model to include anomalous or excess losses. The instantaneous power loss due to eddy currents then consists of two terms, one of which depends on (dB/dt)/sup 2/ and the other one on (dB/dt)/sup 1.5/. The first term is the classical power loss and the second term, due to Bertotti, is the excess power loss. It is shown how these terms are incorporated into a time dependent hysteresis model. The main achievement is that a self-consistent model of hysteresis has been developed in which the quasi-static hysteresis curves are shown to be a limiting case of the more general frequency dependent model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.334076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7861","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.334076","endPage":"4328","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/7861/00334076.pdf","startPage":"4326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling the effects of eddy current losses on frequency dependent hysteresis in electrically conducting media","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/334076/","displayDocTitle":"Modelling the effects of eddy current losses on frequency dependent hysteresis in electrically conducting media","volume":"30","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"4860858","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling the effects of eddy current losses on frequency dependent hysteresis in electrically conducting media","sourcePdf":"00334076.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034698S","chronDate":"Nov.  1994","isNumber":"7861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"116","articleId":"334076","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":334299,"authors":[{"name":"E.

These structures are based on a canceler of linear and nonlinear channel distortions, and can achieve significant improvement in terms of mean-square error and error probability. Proper operation of the canceler requires reliable preliminary decisions to be taken on the information symbols. These decisions are obtained by passing the received signal through a linear equalizer, then processing the equalized signal through a symbol-by-symbol detector or a Viterbi detector. By using the data obtained in [4] for magneto-resistive heads, it was found that symbol-by-symbol preliminary detection performs adequately. A Volterra model was also obtained experimentally for the recording channel generated by magneto-inductive heads that exhibit higher-order nonlinear effects. In order to recover data from this highly distorted channel the preliminary detection scheme needs a 4-state Viterbi detector.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.334299","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/7861/00334299.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.334299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7861","startPage":"5079","endPage":"5086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compensation of nonlinearities in high-density magnetic recording channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=334299","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compensation of nonlinearities in high-density magnetic recording channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/334299/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4842719","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compensation of nonlinearities in high-density magnetic recording channels","sourcePdf":"00334299.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033481S","chronDate":"Nov.  1994","isNumber":"7861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"26","articleId":"334299","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":334301,"authors":[{"name":"P.A.

A multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) channel that models the multiple-head recording process provides the basis for this analysis. This model characterizes the write process, the read process and both electronics and media noise. In particular, the model accounts for side fringing between a read head and adjacent tracks; side fringing is a major cause of intertrack interference that is often neglected during signal processing analysis. Optimal decision feedback and partial response equalizers for the MIMO channel are derived using a minimum mean-squared error criterion. Numerical evaluations show that a magnetic recording system comprising a multiple-head array and equalizer combats intertrack interference much better than does the corresponding single-head system. As a result, the multiple-head system achieves a gain of up to a factor of 3.5 in radial density over the single-head system for a fixed value of maximum head misalignment.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.334301","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00334301.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/7861/00334301.pdf","startPage":"5100","endPage":"5114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7861","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.334301","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multichannel signal processing for multiple-head digital magnetic recording","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/334301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Multichannel signal processing for multiple-head digital magnetic recording","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4849130","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multichannel signal processing for multiple-head digital magnetic recording","sourcePdf":"00334301.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068835S","chronDate":"Nov.  1994","isNumber":"7861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"31","articleId":"334301","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":334388,"authors":[{"name":"S.N.

We prove that manufacturing the features proposed by our feature extractor results exactly in the desired part-in this respect, the approach is both sound and complete. Our method uses the adjacency information between faces to derive the features. This keeps the determination of isolated features in a part straightforward. However, interaction of features creates difficulties since the adjacency information between some faces is lost. We derive this lost information by considering faces that when extended intersect other faces to form concave edges. The derived face adjacencies are termed virtual links. Augmenting the virtual links to the cavity graph of the object leads to its feature graph, and subgraph matching of primitive graphs in this graph results in feature hypotheses. A feature hypothesis is considered valid if the volume corresponding to it is not shared with the part in question; therefore, we verify the feature hypotheses by checking the regularized intersection of the feature volume and the part. Thus, feature verification employs a constructive solid geometry approach. We have implemented a prototype of the system in the Smalltalk-80 environment.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.334388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.334388","endPage":"1100","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00334388.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/7863/00334388.pdf","startPage":"1087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Geometric reasoning for extraction of manufacturing features in iso-oriented polyhedrons","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/334388/","displayDocTitle":"Geometric reasoning for extraction of manufacturing features in iso-oriented polyhedrons","volume":"16","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"4842844","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Geometric reasoning for extraction of manufacturing features in iso-oriented polyhedrons","sourcePdf":"00334388.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042895S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"40","articleId":"334388","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":334412,"authors":[{"name":"J.K.

The main objective of this paper is to introduce the fundamental concepts of Petri nets to researchers and practitioners, both from academia and industry, who are involved in the work in the areas of modelling and analysis of industrial types of systems, as well as those who may potentially be involved in these areas. The paper begins with an overview of applications of Petri nets, mostly industrial ones. Then, it proceeds with a description of Petri nets, properties, and analysis methods. The discussion of properties is put in the context of industrial applications. The analysis methods are illustrated using an example of a simple robotic assembly system. The performance analysis, using Petri nets, is discussed for deterministic and stochastic Petri nets. The presented techniques are illustrated by examples representing simple production systems. In addition, the paper introduces high-level Petri nets, fuzzy Petri nets, and temporal Petri nets. This is done in the context of application prospects. The paper also briefly discusses some of the reasons restricting the use of Petri nets, mostly, to academic institutions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/334574/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","volume":"41","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"4841687","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Petri nets and industrial applications: A tutorial","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Petri nets and industrial applications: A tutorial","sourcePdf":"00334574.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082906S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7866","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"395","articleId":"334574","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":334584,"authors":[{"name":"G.S.

Furthermore, processing time is reduced and accuracy is enhanced by the use of knowledge propagation, where information derived from one slice is made available to succeeding slices as additional knowledge. The system is organized as follows. Each MR slice is initially segmented by an unsupervised fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm. Next, an expert system uses model-based recognition techniques to locate a landmark, called a focus-of attention tissue. Qualitative models of slices of brain tissue are defined and matched with their instances from imaged slices. If a significant deformation is detected in a tissue, the slice is classified to be abnormal and volume processing halts. Otherwise, the expert system locates the next focus-of-attention tissue, based on a hierarchy of expected tissues. This process is repeated until either a slice is classified as abnormal or all tissues of the slice are labeled. If the slice is determined to be abnormal, the entire volume is also considered abnormal and processing halts. Otherwise, the system will proceed to the next slice and repeat the classification steps until all slices that comprise the volume are processed. A rule-based expert system tool, CLIPS, is used to organize the system. Low level modules for image processing and high level modules for image analysis, all written in the C language, are called as actions from the right hand sides of the rules. The system described here is an attempt to provide completely automatic segmentation and labeling of normal volunteer brains. The absolute accuracy of the segmentations has not yet been rigorously established. The relative accuracy appears acceptable. Efforts have been made to segment an entire volume (rather than merging a set of segmented slices) using supervised pattern recognition techniques or unsupervised fuzzy clustering. However, there is sometimes enough data nonuniformity between slices to prevent satisfactory segmentation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/51.334636","startPage":"730","endPage":"742","publicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/51.334636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7868","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/51/7868/00334636.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MRI segmentation using fuzzy clustering techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/334636/","displayDocTitle":"MRI segmentation using fuzzy clustering techniques","volume":"13","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4836459","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.-Dec.  1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MRI segmentation using fuzzy clustering techniques","sourcePdf":"00334636.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037848S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  1994","isNumber":"7868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"51","citationCount":"150","articleId":"334636","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":334639,"authors":[{"name":"Y.M.

Fluorine enhanced boron diffusion in the gate oxide during high temperature process is believed to account for the RSCE, which is also confirmed by using a two-dimensional process simulator.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/334659/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4831504","displayDocTitle":"Anomalous reverse short-channel effect in p/sup +/ polysilicon gated P-channel MOSFET","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomalous reverse short-channel effect in p/sup +/ polysilicon gated P-channel MOSFET","sourcePdf":"00334659.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04729S","chronDate":"Nov.  1994","isNumber":"7869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"16","articleId":"334659","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":334665,"authors":[{"name":"W.

It is shown that the strategy based on unity-power factor control is appropriate when the supply voltage waveform of the plant where the active filter is connected shows significant distortion. As voltage distortion increases, this strategy provides compensated line current having lower harmonic distortion and RMS value with respect to the strategy generally used. This contributes to diminish the current and voltage distortion in networks. The unity-power factor compensation strategy conditions the current flowing in the plant where compensation is realized to fit the voltage waveform, thus reaching a unity power factor. Hence, the line current RMS value is minimum. The comparison of the strategies is performed by both Monte Carlo and ATP simulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/334773/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4843797","volume":"9","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Compensation strategies for shunt active-filter control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compensation strategies for shunt active-filter control","sourcePdf":"00334773.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035987S","chronDate":"Nov.  1994","isNumber":"7872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"98","articleId":"334773","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":334775,"authors":[{"name":"Guichao Hua","affiliation":["The Bradley Department of Electrical Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"lastName":"Guichao Hua","id":"37087310493"},{"name":"E.X.

All the calculations are conducted only by algebraic calculation with high accuracy. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparison to the results of time simulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/63.334779","startPage":"631","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/7872/00334779.pdf","endPage":"637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.334779","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/334779/","displayDocTitle":"An analytical method for calculating harmonic currents of a three-phase diode-bridge rectifier with DC filter","volume":"9","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4843803","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analytical method for calculating harmonic currents of a three-phase diode-bridge rectifier with DC filter","sourcePdf":"00334779.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033719S","chronDate":"Nov.  1994","isNumber":"7872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"85","articleId":"334779","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":334819,"authors":[{"name":"L.F.

Upon increasing the amplifier temperature from O/spl deg/C to 40/spl deg/C, a 20% increase in the gain bandwidth and a twofold increase in the saturation output power, due to an increase in Auger recombination, are observed. The implications of these results on the ultimate capacity of cascaded amplifier systems is evaluated using the concept of the maximum length amplifier cascade. When operated at 40/spl deg/C, this length extends to 6000 km, which is of great relevance for the design of 1300 mm soliton systems, because these short pulses are considered to be able to traverse these large lengths of optical fiber without distortion.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7875","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.334819","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/7875/00334819.pdf","startPage":"1300","endPage":"1302","doi":"10.1109/68.334819","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temperature dependence of a 1300 nm polarization-insensitive multiple quantum well laser amplifier and its implications for the ultimate capacity of cascaded amplifier systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Temperature dependence of a 1300 nm polarization-insensitive multiple quantum well laser amplifier and its implications for the ultimate capacity of cascaded amplifier systems","volume":"6","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4844404","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/334819/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temperature dependence of a 1300 nm polarization-insensitive multiple quantum well laser amplifier and its implications for the ultimate capacity of cascaded amplifier systems","sourcePdf":"00334819.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033758S","chronDate":"Nov.  1994","isNumber":"7875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"4","articleId":"334819","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":334825,"authors":[{"name":"B.

These amplifiers do not exhibit significant degradation of their noise performance when the input powers are as large as +3 dBm.

Many query-processing operations can be implemented using sort- or hash-based algorithms, e.g. intersections, joins, and duplicate elimination. In the early relational database systems, only sort-based algorithms were employed. In the last decade, hash-based algorithms have gained acceptance and popularity, and are often considered generally superior to sort-based algorithms such as merge-join. In this article, we compare the concepts behind sort- and hash-based query-processing algorithms and conclude that (1) many dualities exist between the two types of algorithms, (2) their costs differ mostly by percentages rather than by factors, (3) several special cases exist that favor one or the other choice, and (4) there is a strong reason why both hash- and sort-based algorithms should be available in a query-processing system. Our conclusions are supported by experiments performed using the Volcano query execution engine.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7877","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/69/7877/00334883.pdf","doi":"10.1109/69.334883","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/69.334883","startPage":"934","endPage":"944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sort vs. hash revisited","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/334883/","displayDocTitle":"Sort vs. hash revisited","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"4827741","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sort vs. hash revisited","sourcePdf":"00334883.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055786S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"23","articleId":"334883","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":334899,"authors":[{"name":"P.K.

System supported multicast services can potentially offer improved performance, increased functionality, and simplified programming, and may in turn be used to support various higher-level operations for data movement and global process control. This paper presents efficient algorithms to implement multicast communication in wormhole-routed direct networks, in the absence of hardware multicast support, by exploiting the properties of the switching technology. Minimum-time multicast algorithms are presented for n-dimensional meshes and hypercubes that use deterministic, dimension-ordered routing of unicast messages. Both algorithms can deliver a multicast message to m-1 destinations in [log/sub 2/ m] message passing steps, while avoiding contention among the constituent unicast messages. Performance results of implementations on a 64-node nCUBE-2 hypercube and a 168-node Symult 2010 2-D mesh are given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/71.334899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7878","startPage":"1252","endPage":"1265","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/7878/00334899.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.334899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unicast-based multicast communication in wormhole-routed networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicast communication","Multicast algorithms","Hypercubes","Unicast","Parallel processing","Functional programming","Process control","Hardware","Communication switching","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["message passing","hypercube networks","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unicast-based multicast communication","wormhole-routed networks","destination nodes","parallel computing","performance","functionality","global process control","n-dimensional meshes","hypercubes","dimension-ordered routing","unicast messages","message passing","nCUBE-2 hypercube","168-node Symult 2010 2-D mesh"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"Unicast-based multicast communication in wormhole-routed networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/334899/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"5","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4838412","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unicast-based multicast communication in wormhole-routed networks","sourcePdf":"00334899.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049584S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7878","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"205","articleId":"334899","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":334900,"authors":[{"name":"S.

We discuss several algorithms and study their effectiveness from the view of static scheduling as well as run-time scheduling. An approximate analysis shows that with n processors, and assuming that every processor sends and receives d messages to random destinations, our algorithm can perform the scheduling in O(dn In d) time, on average, and can use an expected number of d+log d partial permutations to carry out the communication.

Photonic antenna links allow immunity from electromagnetic interference, provide an extremely wide working bandwidth, and allow long cable runs with a minimum of loss. Developments in laser technology allow photonic-based links to have very low noise figures and high dynamic range. Opto-electronic devices are now being built in III-V semiconductors (GaAs, InP), which will ultimately lead to opto-electronic integration with MMIC devices. Photonic systems will revolutionize the way in which electromagnetic-measurement and antenna systems will be designed and built in the future.

Overlapped block motion compensation (OBMC) is formulated as a probabilistic linear estimator of pixel intensities given the limited block motion information available to the decoder. Although overlapped techniques have been observed to reduce blocking artifacts in video coding, this analysis establishes for the first time how (and why) OBMC can offer substantial reductions in prediction error as well, even with no change in the encoder's search and no extra side information. Performance can be further enhanced with the use of state variable conditioning in the compensation process. We describe the design of optimized windows for OBMC. We also demonstrate how, with additional encoder complexity, a motion estimation algorithm optimized for OBMC offers further significant gains in compensation accuracy.

Starting from the initial values obtained by a commonly-used block matching independent search method, the motion vectors are iteratively refined until a locally optimal solution to the motion estimation problem for interpolative prediction is achieved. Each iteration consists of a series of two similar procedures. First, the backward motion vector is fixed and a new forward motion vector is searched to minimize the interpolation error. Then the forward motion vector is fixed and the backward motion vector is similarly refined by minimizing the interpolation error.

Mathematical morphology is very attractive for this purpose because it efficiently deals with geometrical features such as size, shape, contrast, or connectivity that can be considered as segmentation-oriented features. The algorithm follows a top-down procedure. It first takes into account the global information and produces a coarse segmentation, that is, with a small number of regions. Then, the segmentation quality is improved by introducing regions corresponding to more local information. The algorithm, considering sequences as being functions on a 3-D space, directly segments 3-D regions. A 3-D approach is used to get a segmentation that is stable in time and to directly solve the region correspondence problem. Each segmentation stage relies on four basic steps: simplification, marker extraction, decision, and quality estimation. The simplification removes information from the sequence to make it easier to segment. Morphological filters based on partial reconstruction are proven to be very efficient for this purpose, especially in the case of sequences. The marker extraction identifies the presence of homogeneous 3-D regions. It is based on constrained flat region labeling and morphological contrast extraction. The goal of the decision is to precisely locate the contours of regions detected by the marker extraction. This decision is performed by a modified watershed algorithm. Finally, the quality estimation concentrates on the coding residue, all the information about the 3-D regions that have not been properly segmented and therefore coded. The procedure allows the introduction of the texture and contour coding schemes within the segmentation algorithm. The coding residue is transmitted to the next segmentation stage to improve the segmentation and coding quality. Finally, segmentation and coding examples are presented to show the validity and interest of the coding approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical morphological segmentation for image sequence coding","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.334980","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/7881/00334980.pdf","startPage":"639","endPage":"651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.334980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7881","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=334980","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/334980/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical morphological segmentation for image sequence coding","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4776332","pubMedId":"18291957","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical morphological segmentation for image sequence coding","sourcePdf":"00334980.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041722S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"156","articleId":"334980","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":334981,"authors":[{"name":"J.Y.A.

It describes a sequence by nodal positions and colors in a starting frame, followed by nodal displacements in the following frames. The nodal points in the mesh are more densely distributed in regions containing interesting features such as edges and corners; and are dynamically updated to follow the same features in successive frames. They are determined automatically by maximizing feature (e.g., gradient) magnitudes at nodal points, while minimizing interpolation errors within individual elements, and matching errors between corresponding elements. In order to avoid the mesh elements becoming overly deformed, a penalty term is also incorporated, which measures the irregularity of the mesh structure. The notions of shape functions and master elements commonly used in the finite element method have been applied to simplify the numerical calculation of the energy functions and their gradients. The proposed representation is motivated by the active contour or snake model proposed by Kass, Witkin, and Terzopoulos (1988). The current representation retains the salient merit of the original model as a feature tracker based on local and collective information, while facilitating more accurate image interpolation and prediction. Our computer simulations have shown that the proposed scheme can successfully track facial feature movements in head-and-shoulder type of sequences, and more generally, interframe changes that can be modeled as elastic deformation. The treatment for the starting frame also constitutes an efficient representation of arbitrary still images.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/334982/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","volume":"3","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"4776330","pubMedId":"18291955","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Active mesh-a feature seeking and tracking image sequence representation scheme","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active mesh-a feature seeking and tracking image sequence representation scheme","sourcePdf":"00334982.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055901S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"95","articleId":"334982","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":334983,"authors":[{"name":"Haibo Li","affiliation":["Image Coding Group, Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"lastName":"Haibo Li","id":"37087375267"},{"name":"A.

The first part of this paper presents a study on concepts for temporal-axis frequency decomposition along the motion trajectory in video sequences. It is shown that, if a two-band split is used, it is possible to overcome the problem of spatial inhomogeneity in the motion vector field (MVF), which occurs at the positions of uncovered and covered areas. In these cases, original pixel values from one frame are placed into the lowpass-band signal, while displaced-frame-difference values are embedded into the highpass band. This technique is applicable with arbitrary MVF's; examples with block-matching and interpolative motion compensation are given. Derivations are first performed for the example of two-tap quadrature mirror filters (QMF's), and then generalized to any linear-phase QMF's. With two-band analysis and synthesis stages arranged as cascade structures, higher resolution frequency decompositions are realizable. In the second part of the paper, encoding of the temporal-axis subband signals is discussed. A parallel filterbank scheme was used for spatial subband decomposition, and adaptive lattice vector quantization was employed to approach the entropy rate of the 3-D subband samples. Coding results suggest that high-motion video sequences can be encoded at significantly lower rates than those achievable with conventional hybrid coders. Main advantages are the high energy compaction capability and the nonrecursive decoder structure. In the conclusion, the scheme is interpreted more generally, viewed as a motion-compensated short-time spectral analysis of video sequences, which can adapt to the quickness of changes. Although a 3-D multiresolution representation of the picture information is produced, a true multiresolution representation of motion information, based on spatio-temporal decimation and interpolation of the MVF, is regarded as the still-missing part.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.334985","startPage":"559","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/7881/00334985.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.334985","endPage":"571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-dimensional subband coding with motion compensation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/334985/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Three-dimensional subband coding with motion compensation","volume":"3","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4776327","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","pubMedId":"18291952","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-dimensional subband coding with motion compensation","sourcePdf":"00334985.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"361","articleId":"334985","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":334986,"authors":[{"name":"Jinho Choi","affiliation":["Speech Team, Multimedia Laboratory, DACOM Corporation Research and Development Center, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jinho Choi","id":"37087254466"},{"name":"Daechul Park","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication, Han Nam University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Daechul Park","id":"37087455441"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0042"}],"articleNumber":"334986","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":13,"totalDownloads":268},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback control","Nonlinear equations","Stability","Lagrangian functions","Rate-distortion","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Quantization","State feedback","Lyapunov method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","Lyapunov methods","stability","computational complexity","image coding","analogue-digital conversion","encoding","image sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stable feedback control","buffer state","controlled Lagrange multiplier method","rate-distortion characteristics","buffer-constrained adaptive quantization","state equation nonlinearity","average distortion-rate curve","information source","buffer control algorithm","Lyapunov stability theory","computational complexity","entropy coder","source coding","image sequence coding"]}],"abstract":"We propose a stable feedback control algorithm of the buffer state using the controlled Lagrange multiplier in combined rate-distortion characteristics for a buffer-constrained adaptive quantization.

It is shown that the stability of the algorithm depends on average distortion-rate curve and buffer size, and sufficient conditions for the algorithm to be stable are obtained from the usual average distortion-rate curve.

While optimal bit allocation for independently coded signal blocks has been studied in the literature, we extend these techniques to the more general temporally and spatially dependent coding scenarios. Of particular interest are the topical MPEG video coder and multiresolution coders. Our approach uses an operational rate-distortion (R-D) framework for arbitrary quantizer sets. We show how a certain monotonicity property of the dependent R-D curves can be exploited in formulating fast ways to obtain optimal and near-optimal solutions. We illustrate the application of this property in specifying intelligent pruning conditions to eliminate suboptimal operating points for the MPEG allocation problem, for which we also point out fast nearly-optimal heuristics. Additionally, we formulate an efficient allocation strategy for multiresolution coders, using the spatial pyramid coder as an example. We then extend this analysis to a spatio-temporal 3-D pyramidal coding scheme. We tackle the compatibility problem of optimizing full-resolution quality while simultaneously catering to subresolution bit rate or quality constraints. We show how to obtain fast solutions that provide nearly optimal (typically within 0.3 dB) full resolution quality while providing much better performance for the subresolution layer (typically 2-3 dB better than the full-resolution optimal solution).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.334987","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","startPage":"533","endPage":"545","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/7881/00334987.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.334987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit allocation for dependent quantization with applications to multiresolution and MPEG video coders","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit rate","Quantization","Spatial resolution","Rate-distortion","Image coding","Signal resolution","Constraint optimization","Source coding","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","analogue-digital conversion","video signals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient bit allocation","spatially dependent coding","dependent quantization","MPEG video coders","temporally dependent coding","multiresolution coders","operational rate-distortion framework","arbitrary quantizer sets","monotonicity property","near-optimal solutions","optimal solutions","intelligent pruning conditions","fast nearly-optimal heuristics","allocation strategy","spatial pyramid coder","spatio-temporal 3-D pyramidal coding scheme","full-resolution quality optimisation","subresolution bit rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Bit allocation for dependent quantization with applications to multiresolution and MPEG video coders","volume":"3","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4776325","pubMedId":"18291950","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/334987/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit allocation for dependent quantization with applications to multiresolution and MPEG video coders","sourcePdf":"00334987.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043598S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"318","articleId":"334987","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":334989,"authors":[{"name":"Jungwoo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Jungwoo Lee","id":"37087218359"},{"name":"B.W.

The number of reference frames and the intervals between them are adjusted according to the temporal variation of the input video. Bit-rate control for this dynamic group of pictures (GOP) structure is achieved by taking advantage of temporal masking in human vision. Constant picture quality can be obtained by variable-bit-rate coding using this approach. Further improvement can be made when the intervals between reference frames are chosen by minimizing a measure of the coding difficulty of a GOP. Advantages for low bit-rate coding and implications for variable-bit-rate coding are discussed.

Additional savings may be obtained by combining the self-timed circuits with a mechanism that adaptively adjusts the supply voltage to the smallest possible, while maintaining the performance requirements. This paper describes such a mechanism, analyzes the possible power savings, and presents a demonstrator chip that has been fabricated and tested. The idea of voltage scaling has been used previously in synchronous circuits, and the contributions of the present paper are: 1) the combination of supply scaling and self-timed circuitry which has some unique advantages, and 2) the thorough analysis of the power savings that are possible using this technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/335008/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4839245","volume":"2","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Low-power operation using self-timed circuits and adaptive scaling of the supply voltage","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-power operation using self-timed circuits and adaptive scaling of the supply voltage","sourcePdf":"00335008.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02603S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"7882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"148","articleId":"335008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":335009,"authors":[{"name":"W.C.

When adiabatic switching is used, the signal energies stored on circuit capacitances may be recycled instead of dissipated as heat. We describe the fundamental adiabatic amplifier circuit and analyze its performance. The dissipation of the adiabatic amplifier is compared to that of conventional switching circuits, both for the case of a fixed voltage swing and the case when the voltage swing can be scaled to reduce power dissipation. We show how combinational and sequential adiabatic-switching logic circuits may be constructed and describe the timing restrictions required for adiabatic operation.

We show several interesting properties of the optimal SDWS solutions under the two objectives, including an important result which reveals the relationship between driver sizing and optimal wire sizing.

We present a powerful sequential logic optimization method that is based on selectively precomputing the output logic values of the circuit one clock cycle before they are required, and using the precomputed values to reduce internal switching activity in the succeeding clock cycle. We present two different precomputation architectures which exploit this observation. The primary optimization step is the synthesis of the precomputation logic, which computes the output values for a subset of input conditions. If the output values can be precomputed, the original logic circuit can be \"turned off\" in the next clock cycle and will have substantially reduced switching activity. The size of the precomputation logic determines the power dissipation reduction, area increase and delay increase relative to the original circuit. Given a logic-level sequential circuit, we present an automatic method of synthesizing precomputation logic so as to achieve maximal reductions in power dissipation. We present experimental results on various sequential circuits. Up to 75% reductions in average switching activity and power dissipation are possible with marginal increases in circuit area and delay.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/92.335011","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/7882/00335011.pdf","startPage":"426","endPage":"436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.335011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precomputation-based sequential logic optimization for low power","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/335011/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Precomputation-based sequential logic optimization for low power","volume":"2","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4839248","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precomputation-based sequential logic optimization for low power","sourcePdf":"00335011.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031716S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"7882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"213","articleId":"335011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":335012,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Power constraints are increasingly becoming the critical component of the design specification of these systems. At present, however, power analysis tools can only be applied at the lower levels of the design-the circuit or gate level. It is either impractical or impossible to use the lower level tools to estimate the power cost of the software component of the system. This paper describes the first systematic attempt to model this power cost. A power analysis technique is developed that has been applied to two commercial microprocessors-Intel 486DX2 and Fujitsu SPARClite 934. This technique can be employed to evaluate the power cost of embedded software. This can help in verifying if a design meets its specified power constraints. Further, it can also be used to search the design space in software power optimization. Examples with power reduction of up to 40%, obtained by rewriting code using the information provided by the instruction level power model, illustrate the potential of this idea.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/92.335012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7882","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.335012","endPage":"445","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/7882/00335012.pdf","startPage":"437","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power analysis of embedded software: a first step towards software power minimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/335012/","displayDocTitle":"Power analysis of embedded software: a first step towards software power minimization","volume":"2","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4839249","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power analysis of embedded software: a first step towards software power minimization","sourcePdf":"00335012.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070307S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"7882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"605","articleId":"335012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":335013,"authors":[{"name":"F.N.

This simulation method facilitates consideration of multiple faults in the replicated circuit modules as well as the majority voting circuits to account for the fact that, in VLSI implementations, the majority voting circuits are constructed from components of the same reliability as those used to construct the circuit modules. From the fault injection simulation, a survivability distribution is obtained which, when combined with an area overhead expression, leads to a more accurate reliability model for majority voting based VLSI fault-tolerant circuits. The new model is extended to facilitate the calculation of reliability of fault-tolerant circuits which have sustained faults but continue to operate properly. Analysis of the reliability model indicates that, for some circuits, the reliability obtained with majority voting techniques is significantly greater than predicted by any previous model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/335020/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4839257","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Reliability of majority voting based VLSI fault-tolerant circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability of majority voting based VLSI fault-tolerant circuits","sourcePdf":"00335020.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042773S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"7882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"66","articleId":"335020","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":335027,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The proposed architectures consist of significantly fewer comparators than existing sorting network-based architectures that are based on bubble-sort and Batcher's odd-even merge sort. The reduction in the number of comparators is obtained by sorting the columns of the window only once, and by merging the sorted columns in a way such that the number of candidate elements for the output is very small. The number of comparators per output is reduced even further by processing a block of outputs at a time. Block processing procedures that exploit the computational overlap between consecutive windows are developed for both the proposed networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/7882/00335027.pdf","startPage":"502","endPage":"507","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/92.335027","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.335027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7882","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=335027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel sorting network-based architectures for rank order filters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sorting","Nonlinear filters","Computer architecture","Digital filters","Computer networks","Delay","Merging","Information filtering","Information filters","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital filters","sorting","pipeline processing","CMOS digital integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sorting network-based architectures","rank order filters","high sample rate nonrecursive filters","comparators reduction","block processing procedures","CMOS implementation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/335027/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Novel sorting network-based architectures for rank order filters","volume":"2","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4839254","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel sorting network-based architectures for rank order filters","sourcePdf":"00335027.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04603S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"7882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"21","articleId":"335027","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":335039,"authors":[{"name":"C.P.

Such a device requires effective cleaning to ensure its long-term reliability. In order to achieve reliability without hermeticity with these IC devices, various organic (silicones, epoxies, polyimides, etc.) and inorganic (silicon oxides, silicon nitrides, etc.) coating materials are used for protection. However, packaging contaminated IC devices guarantees device failure, and preencapsulation cleaning methods and controls are the most critical process steps in determining the reliability of the packaged IC devices. We have prepared well-controlled substrates (such as SiO/sub 2/, SiN, SiON) for our cleaning experiments and have developed a series of cleaning processes that achieve the best cleaning results prior to encapsulation. These cleaning processes consist of both chlorofluoro hydrocarbon (CFC) and non-CFC solutions including (d-limonene), isopropanol, new surfactants, high purity, deionized water (DI H/sub 2/O), peroxide (H/sub 2/O/sub 2/), etc. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that contact angle measurements in a 100% RH environment are simple, fast, and reliable in detecting the substrate surface cleanliness, particularly with respect to hydrocarbon contamination on the first /spl sim/10 angstroms of surface layers. ESCA and contact angle measurement analyses are also used to quantify and correlate the cleaning processes. Results of these processes are given in this report.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/335039/","volume":"17","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4848350","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Preencapsulation cleaning methods and control for microelectronics packaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preencapsulation cleaning methods and control for microelectronics packaging","sourcePdf":"00335039.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042435S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7883","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"95","citationCount":"32","articleId":"335039","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":335042,"authors":[{"name":"Ping Liu","affiliation":["School of Technology, Eastern Illinois University, Charleston, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Ping Liu","id":"37653522900"},{"name":"S.

Electrical sliding was performed between a Cu-Nb composite pin and a flat surface of a hardened tool steel disk in ambient atmosphere. The effects of Nb proportion, electrical current density, sliding speed, and Nb-filament orientation on the friction and wear behavior were investigated. It was found that the coefficient of friction decreased with increasing Nb proportion and Cu-20 vol.%Nb has the best wear resistance. Both the coefficient of friction and wear rate increased as a small electrical current was applied and then decreased as the current density increased. With increase in sliding speed, the coefficient of friction and wear on the Cu-Nb composite decreased. The composite with Nb-filaments perpendicular to sliding direction was found to have higher wear resistance than that of parallel orientation. The deformation layer and oxide film of the composite are much thicker at electrical sliding than nonelectrical sliding. The surface oxide played a key role in governing the sliding friction and wear behavior of the Cu-Nb composites under electrical current.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7883","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part A","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part A","pdfPath":"/iel4/95/7883/00335042.pdf","doi":"10.1109/95.335042","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/95.335042","startPage":"616","endPage":"624","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrical sliding friction and wear behavior of Cu-Nb in situ composites","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/335042/","displayDocTitle":"Electrical sliding friction and wear behavior of Cu-Nb in situ composites","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4853341","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrical sliding friction and wear behavior of Cu-Nb in situ composites","sourcePdf":"00335042.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048975S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7883","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"95","citationCount":"2","articleId":"335042","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":335047,"authors":[{"name":"P.L.

We summarize physical effects and materials issues important for reliable operation of semiconductor device technologies at high temperatures (>125/spl deg/C). We review the high-temperature potential of Si, GaAs, other III-V compounds, and SiC. For completeness, we also comment on nitrides, diamond, and vacuum microelectronics. We conclude that Si on insulator (SOI) technology can be developed readily for small signal operation up to about 300/spl deg/C. There is some ongoing work in this area. GaAs offers little advantage over Si because of poor device isolation and the lack of reliable contacts above 250/spl deg/C. Other III-V compounds could be developed for operation to /spl sim/600/spl deg/C, using processes similar to those used for optoelectronics. There may be a market niche for III-V power devices above 200/spl deg/C. There is considerable activity in semiconducting SiC, and device functionality has been demonstrated above 600/spl deg/C. SiC is promising for operation above 300/spl deg/C, and for power devices at frequencies from dc to /spl sim/10 GHz, but it faces numerous challenges to achieve manufacturable status.

In this paper, we present measured and simulated results demonstrating that the losses of a coplanar transmission line (CPW) realized on silicon substrates are comparable to the losses of a CPW realized on a GaAs substrate with insulators. The loss mechanisms of Si and GaAs substrates used for microwave applications are analyzed using both microwave and semiconductor physics theory. A high resistivity Si substrate can be used both as a microwave substrate and an active element carrier permitting further integration at low cost.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1994.335101","startPage":"1759","publicationTitle":"1994 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest (Cat.

The measured DSB conversion loss and noise temperature at 258 GHz are 9.0/spl plusmn/0.3 dB and 2000/spl plusmn/100 K for the antenna/mixer, respectively. The measured results are expected to be about 2 dB better with more LO power and a matching cap layer. The uniplanar double-slot antenna receiver is less than 0.3/spl times/1 mm in size including the IF filter and represents the first fully monolithic 250 GHz receiver to date.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1994.335130","publicationTitle":"1994 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest (Cat.

A high dielectric-constant substrate and meandered coupled-line configuration are adopted to realize small size. In the designing, the effects of meandered configuration of microstrip lines with narrow spacing between the neighboring pair lines were calculated directly using three dimensional finite element method (3-D FEM). The calculated results showed that above mentioned highly packed meander structure retains practical 90 degree hybrid coupler performance. A experiment done afterward supported the simulated results. A bandwidth of one octave from 1 GHz to 2 GHz with /spl plusmn/0.8 dB power dividing balance and 90/spl plusmn/3 degrees phase difference were achieved experimentally with dimensions of 3.0 mm/spl times/2.85 mm/spl times/2.0 mm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest (Cat.

With the proposed model the designer can easily take into account the high frequency behavior of the via hole discontinuity. This is important in high frequency MMICs applications, since it is found that radiation, while negligible at low frequencies, increases significantly at higher frequencies. Comparisons with measured data confirm the accuracy of the proposed approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microstrip","Frequency","Equivalent circuits","Surface waves","MMICs","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave integrated circuits","microstrip lines","equivalent circuits","MMIC"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["via-hole grounds","microstrip lines","equivalent circuit","resistive effects","reactive and resistive effects","radiation","surface waves","via hole discontinuity","MMIC","millimeter wave IC"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7886","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1994.335309","startPage":"341","endPage":"344 vol.1","publicationTitle":"1994 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest (Cat.

The introduced method of time series analysis to extract propagation and attenuation constants reduces the desired computation time drastically up to a factor 25. Additionally, a nonequidistant discretization can be used to reduce the number of points in the spatial grid. Therefore, it is possible to simulate, e.g. coplanar waveguide (CPW) structures with very thin conductors and small dimensions, as they are used in MMIC technology, The simulation results of several examples are compared with measurements and show good agreement.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1994.335366","publicationTitle":"1994 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest (Cat.

At present the most widely used imaging technique for the detection of breast tumours is mammography, however, a major disadvantage of this method is that it uses ionising radiation. There is therefore a need for complementary techniques which use non-ionising radiation, for example microwaves. Here the authors present results for a non-invasive imaging system which is currently being used to explore the feasibility of microwave imaging as a method of detecting breast tumours. The authors' purpose is to present a clear description of the theoretical model of the microwave sensor and to demonstrate the techniques used to match experimental measurements and calculated data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1994.335451","publicationTitle":"1994 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest (Cat.

For the IMFET approach, when PHEMT devices are used instead of MESFETs, higher PAE (Power-Added Efficiency), power density, and gain are obtained which makes PHEMT ideal technology for the SATCOM business. An IMFET delivering 11 W output power, 13 dB gain, and 60% PAE across the entire 500 MHz bandwidth of 3.7 to 4.2 GHz is shown.

The reliability of this data link must be extremely high, because any transmission interrupt will cause an emergency stop of the vehicle. A radio link, operating in the millimetrewave range at about 40 GHz is well suited for this application. For the German MAGLEV research centre such a millimetrewave communication system has been built and has now been in operation for four years. The paper presents an overview of the realized system. The individual components i.e. mmwave transceiver and transceiver control units, are described.

Despite this shared purpose, LANs have traditionally connected independent and widely separated computers. In contrast, computer I/O has traditionally connected a host to peripheral devices such as terminals, disks, and tape drives. Because these connection tasks were different, the architectures developed for one task were not suitable for the other. Consequently, the technologies used to implement one architecture could not address the issues faced by the other, and the technologies were seen as fundamentally different. However, an examination of the architectural requirements of modern I/O and LANs shows that the differences between the two technologies are now disappearing. We believe that LAN and I/O architectures are in fact converging, and that this convergence reflects significant changes in how and where computing resources are used. To illustrate this convergence and its implications, this article examines several modern LANs and channels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/335725/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4853572","volume":"27","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"LAN and I/O convergence: a survey of the issues","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LAN and I/O convergence: a survey of the issues","sourcePdf":"00335725.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028164S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"7888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"11","articleId":"335725","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":335839,"authors":[{"name":"Weiguo Xi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"lastName":"Weiguo Xi","id":"37664955300"},{"name":"M.A. Stuchly","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Stuchly","id":"37278753900"},{"name":"O.P.

The data presented are useful as the first step in dosimetry for 60 Hz magnetic fields, and for interspecies scaling of biological interactions related to the tissue induced electric currents.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.335839","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/7890/00335839.pdf","startPage":"1018","endPage":"1023","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.335839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Induced electric currents in models of man and rodents from 60 Hz magnetic fields","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=335839","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/335839/","displayDocTitle":"Induced electric currents in models of man and rodents from 60 Hz magnetic fields","volume":"41","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4820683","pubMedId":"8001990","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Induced electric currents in models of man and rodents from 60 Hz magnetic fields","sourcePdf":"00335839.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04087S","chronDate":"Nov.  1994","isNumber":"7890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"62","articleId":"335839","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":335841,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A novel approach to automated electromyogram (EMG) signal decomposition, using an ANN processing architecture, is presented here. Due to the lack of a priori knowledge of motor unit action potential (MUAP) morphology, the EMG decomposition must be performed in an unsupervised manner. An ANN classifier, consisting of a multilayer perceptron neural network and employing a novel unsupervised training strategy, is proposed. The ANN learns repetitive appearances of MUAP waveforms from their suspected occurrences in a filtered EMG signal in an autoassociative learning task. The same training waveforms are fed into the trained ANN and the output of the ANN is fed back to its input, giving rise to a dynamic retrieval net classifier. For each waveform in the data, the network discovers a feature vector associated with that waveform. For each waveform, classification is achieved by comparing its feature vector with those of the other waveforms. Firing information of each MUAP is further used to refine the classification results of the ANN classifier. Then, individual MUAP waveform shapes are derived and their firing tables are created.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.335842","startPage":"1039","endPage":"1052","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/7890/00335842.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.335842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NNERVE: Neural Network Extraction of Repetitive Vectors for Electromyography.

I see ibid., vol. 41, no. 11, p. 1039-53 (1994). In pt. I the authors presented a new method for the decomposition of clinical electromyographic signals, NNERVE, which utilizes a novel \"pseudo-unsupervised\" neural network approach to signal decomposition. Here the authors present a detailed performance analysis. They present definitions for quantitative performance criteria. NNERVE is shown to be highly reliable over a wide range of neural network architectures. It is also minimally sensitive to learning parameters. The degradations of performance over a wide range of signals and parameters are shown to be gradual, slight and graceful. These characteristics are shown to translate directly into a high degree of robustness over widely varying signals. Real signals obtained from the entire range of patients encountered in clinical situations are shown to be correctly handled without any modifications or adjustments of any parameters. This neural network method is then directly compared to a prior traditional signal processing method and is shown quantitatively to have consistently superior performance on both simulated and real signals. Clinically acceptable performance over a wide range of signals, recorded using standard clinical methodology, and the lack of a need for user interaction, will facilitate the use of motor unit quantitation in routine clinical electromyography.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.335843","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/7890/00335843.pdf","startPage":"1053","endPage":"1061","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.335843","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NNERVE: Neural Network Extraction of Repetitive Vectors for Electromyography.

In most cases, these interactions involve and are driven by proteins which are the main conductors of any living process within the organism. The physical nature of these interactions is still not well known. The authors represent a whole new view to biomolecular interactions, in particular protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, based on the assumption that these interactions are electromagnetic in their nature. This new approach is incorporated in the Resonant Recognition Model (RRM), which was developed over the last 10 years. It has been shown initially that certain periodicities within the distribution of energies of delocalized electrons along a protein molecule are critical for protein biological function, i.e., interaction with its target. If protein conductivity was introduced, then a charge moving through protein backbone can produce electromagnetic irradiation or absorption with spectral characteristics corresponding to energy distribution along the protein. The RRM enables these spectral characteristics, which were found to be in the range of infrared and visible light, to be calculated. These theoretically calculated spectra were proved using experimentally obtained frequency characteristics of some light-induced biological processes. Furthermore, completely new peptides with desired spectral characteristics, and consequently corresponding biological activities, were designed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.335859","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/7891/00335859.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.335859","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7891","startPage":"1101","endPage":"1114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Macromolecular bioactivity: is it resonant interaction between macromolecules?-theory and applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=335859","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Macromolecular bioactivity: is it resonant interaction between macromolecules?-theory and applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/335859/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4849046","pubMedId":"7851912","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Macromolecular bioactivity: is it resonant interaction between macromolecules?-theory and applications","sourcePdf":"00335859.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045805S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"7891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"205","articleId":"335859","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":335862,"authors":[{"name":"A.C.

The array is formed by a microassembly of planar silicon multishank microprobes, which are precisely positioned in a micromachined platform that resides on the surface of the cortex. Interconnects between the probes and the platform are formed using electroplated nickel lead transfers, implemented using automated computer control. All dimensions are controlled to /spl plusmn/1 /spl mu/m and shank/probe separations as small as 100 /spl mu/m are possible. Four-probe 16-shank prototype arrays have been tested chronically in guinea pig cortex. After three months in vivo, no significant tissue reaction has been observed surrounding these structures when they remain free to move with the brain, with normal appearing tissue between shanks spaced at 150 /spl mu/m to 200 /spl mu/m intervals. The array structure is compatible with the use of signal processing circuitry both on the probes and on the platform. A platform-based signal processing system has been designed to interface with several active probes, providing direct analog access to the recording sites, performing on-chip analog-to-digital conversion of neural activity, and providing simple binary-output recognition of single-unit spike events using a user-input threshold voltage.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.335862","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/7891/00335862.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.335862","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7891","startPage":"1136","endPage":"1146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A three-dimensional microelectrode array for chronic neural recording","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=335862","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A three-dimensional microelectrode array for chronic neural recording","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/335862/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4849049","pubMedId":"7851915","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A three-dimensional microelectrode array for chronic neural recording","sourcePdf":"00335862.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033123S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"7891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"278","articleId":"335862","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":335863,"authors":[{"name":"L.R.

It is often desirable to have a compact description of their shape and of their time evolution. For this purpose, Fourier analysis is not necessarily the best tool. The Hermite-Rodriguez and Associated Hermite basis functions are applied in this work. Both are based on the product of Hermite polynomials and Gaussian functions. Their general properties relevant to biomedical signal processing are reviewed. Preliminary applications are described concerning the analysis and description of: a) test signals such as a square pulse and a single cycle of a sinewave, b) electrically evoked myoelectric signals, and c) power spectra of either voluntary or evoked signals. It is shown that expansions with only five to ten terms provide an excellent description of the computer simulated and real signals. It is shown that these two families of Hermite functions are well suited for the analysis of nonstationary biological evoked potentials with compact time support. An application to the estimation of scaling factors of electrically evoked myoelectric signals is described. The Hermite functions show advantages with respect to the more traditional spectral analysis, especially in the case of signal truncation due to stimulation with interpulse intervals smaller than the duration of the evoked response. Finally, the Hermite approach is found to be suitable for classification of spectral shapes and compression of spectral information of either voluntary or evoked signals. The approach is very promising for neuromuscular diagnosis and assessment because of its capability for information compression and waveform classification.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hermite expansions of compact support waveforms: applications to myoelectric signals","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/10.335863","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/7891/00335863.pdf","startPage":"1147","endPage":"1159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.335863","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7891","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=335863","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/335863/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Hermite expansions of compact support waveforms: applications to myoelectric signals","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4849050","pubMedId":"7851916","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hermite expansions of compact support waveforms: applications to myoelectric signals","sourcePdf":"00335863.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031984S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"7891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"108","articleId":"335863","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":335876,"authors":[{"name":"P.H.

Let {X/sub t/} be a stationary ergodic process, and suppose an action b/sub t/ must be selected in a space /spl Bscr/ with knowledge of the t-past (X/sub 0/, /spl middot//spl middot//spl middot/, X/sub t-1/) at the beginning of every period t/spl ges/0. Action b/sub t/ will incur a loss l(b/sub t/, X/sub t/) at the end of period t when the random variable X/sub t/ is revealed. The author proves under mild integrability conditions that the optimum strategy is to select actions that minimize the conditional expected loss given the currently available information at each step. The minimum long-run average loss per decision can be approached arbitrarily closely by strategies that are finite-order Markov, and under certain continuity conditions, it is equal to the minimum expected loss given the infinite past. If the loss l(b, x) is bounded and continuous and if the space /spl Bscr/ is compact, then the minimum can be asymptotically attained, even if the distribution of the process {X/sub t/} is unknown a priori and must be learned from experience.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.335876","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.335876","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7892","startPage":"609","endPage":"633","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/7892/00335876.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=335876","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Random variables","Space stations","Pattern classification","Decision theory","Information theory","Information systems","Predictive models","Investments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimisation","decision theory","Markov processes","uncertainty handling","statistical mechanics","information theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["strong law of large numbers","sequential decisions","uncertainty","optimization","ergodic theory","optimum long-run average performance","nonanticipating sequential decisions","stationary ergodic process","random variable","mild integrability conditions","minimization","conditional expected loss","minimum long-run average loss per decision","finite-order Markov strategy","continuity conditions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The strong law of large numbers for sequential decisions under uncertainty","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4761517","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/335876/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The strong law of large numbers for sequential decisions under uncertainty","sourcePdf":"00335876.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066669S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"43","articleId":"335876","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":335877,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

An upper bound on the cardinality of the intersection of two perfect codes of length n is presented, and perfect codes whose intersection attains the upper bound are constructed for all n. As an immediate consequence of the proof of the upper bound the authors obtain a simple closed-form expression for the weight distribution of a perfect code. Furthermore, they prove that the characters of a perfect code satisfy certain constraints, and provide a sufficient condition for a binary code to be perfect. The latter result is employed to derive a generalization of the construction of Phelps (1983), which is shown to give rise to some perfect codes that are nonequivalent to the perfect codes obtained from the known constructions. Moreover, for any m/spl ges/4 the authors construct full-rank perfect binary codes of length 2/sup m/-1. These codes are obviously nonequivalent to any of the previously known perfect codes. Furthermore the latter construction exhibits the existence of full-rank perfect tilings. Finally, they construct a set of 2(2/sup cn/) nonequivalent perfect codes of length n, for sufficiently large n and a constant c=0.5-/spl epsiv/. Precise enumeration of the number of codes in this set provides a slight improvement over the results reported by Phelps.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/335887/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","publicationDate":"May 1994","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4761529","volume":"40","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Perfect binary codes: constructions, properties, and enumeration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Perfect binary codes: constructions, properties, and enumeration","sourcePdf":"00335887.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024612S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"76","articleId":"335887","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":335888,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The codes described are of the simplest variety-codes for which the encoder restricted to any particular channel state is a one-to-one mapping and which is not permitted to \"look ahead\" to future messages. Such codes can be decoded with no memory and no anticipation and are thus an example of what Schouhamer Immink (1992) has referred to as block-decodable. For a given blocklength n and given values of (d, k), the procedure constructs a code with the highest possible rate among all such block codes, and it does so without the iterative search that is typically used (i.e., Franaszek's recursive elimination algorithm). The technique used is similar to Beenker and Immink's (1983) \"Construction 2\" in that every message is associated with a (d, k, l, r) sequence of length n-d; however the values used in the present approach are l=k-d and r=k-1, as opposed to Beenker and Schouhamer Immink's values of l=r=k-d. Thus the present approach demonstrates that \"Construction 2\" is optimal for d=1 but is suboptimal for d>1. Furthermore, the structure of the present codes permits enumerative coding techniques to simplify encoding and decoding.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.335889","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"774","endPage":"785","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/7892/00335889.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.335889","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7892","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach to constructing optimal block codes for runlength-limited channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Block codes","Decoding","Interference constraints","Clocks","Iterative algorithms","Magnetic recording","Optical recording","Data communication","Shape control","Communication system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","optimisation","channel capacity","decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal block codes","runlength-limited channels","construction","fixed-length block codes","channels","encoder","one-to-one mapping","messages","block-decodable","Construction 2","structure","encoding","decoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","displayDocTitle":"A new approach to constructing optimal block codes for runlength-limited channels","volume":"40","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4761531","publicationDate":"May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/335889/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach to constructing optimal block codes for runlength-limited channels","sourcePdf":"00335889.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059085S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"20","articleId":"335889","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":335892,"authors":[{"name":"T.T.

On the other hand, the cost of integration in additional signal processing and overhead may be considerable. As a figure of merit for this tradeoff, the authors propose the dB-gain-to-cost ratio and illustrate its evaluation by using a simple example. The example consists of a pair of detection-localization systems which have complementary features. One has higher resolution that the other, but is more susceptible to random disturbances. The author models the first as a system which detects a signal in multiplicative and additive random disturbances and additive white noise. Thus, one main result is the derivation of the maximum likelihood detector under these disturbances. In the second system, the author assumes the random disturbances to be negligible. Hence, the maximum likelihood detector is the matched filter. Input data to both systems are two-dimensional arrays of real numbers corresponding to the same physical area under observation where the second data array has a coarser grid than the first, thus yielding poorer resolution. The detection probabilities, in terms of which the dB-gains are computed, are evaluated by Monte Carlo simulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.335892","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.335892","startPage":"808","endPage":"819","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/7892/00335892.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7892","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integration of complementary detection-localization systems-an example","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Integration of complementary detection-localization systems-an example","publicationDate":"May 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"40","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4761534","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/335892/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integration of complementary detection-localization systems-an example","sourcePdf":"00335892.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025091S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"2","articleId":"335892","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":335893,"authors":[{"name":"D.

An exact integral expression is derived for the m-sample risk R/sub m/ given that a reference m-sample of labeled points is available to the classifier. The statistical setup assumes that the pattern classes arise in nature with fixed a priori probabilities and that points representing the classes are drawn from Euclidean n-space according to fixed class-conditional probability distributions. The sample is assumed to consist of m independently generated class-labeled points. For a family of smooth class-conditional distributions characterized by asymptotic expansions in general form, it is shown that the m-sample risk R/sub m/ has a complete asymptotic series expansion R/sub m//spl sim/R/sub /spl infin//+/spl Sigma//sub k=2//sup /spl infin//c/sub k/m/sup -k/n/ (m/spl rarr//spl infin/), where R/sub /spl infin// denotes the nearest neighbor risk in the infinite-sample limit and the coefficients c/sub k/ are distribution-dependent constants independent of the sample size m. The analysis thus provides further analytic validation of Bellman's curse of dimensionality. Numerical simulations corroborating the formal results are included, and extensions of the theory discussed. The analysis also contains a novel application of Laplace's asymptotic method of integration to a multidimensional integral where the integrand attains its maximum on a continuum of points.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nearest neighbor searches","Pattern recognition","Probability distribution","Convergence","Pattern analysis","Performance analysis","Numerical simulation","Multidimensional systems","Signal processing","Information theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern recognition","integration","series (mathematics)","convergence of numerical methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite sample performance","nearest neighbor classifier","two-class pattern recognition problem","exact integral expression","m-sample risk","statistical setup","probabilities","Euclidean n-space","fixed class-conditional probability distributions","class-labeled points","smooth class-conditional distributions","asymptotic expansions","series expansion","infinite-sample limit","distribution-dependent constants","Bellman's curse of dimensionality","Laplace's asymptotic method of integration","multidimensional integral","integrand"]}],"doi":"10.1109/18.335893","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/7892/00335893.pdf","startPage":"820","endPage":"837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7892","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.335893","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the finite sample performance of the nearest neighbor classifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=335893","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the finite sample performance of the nearest neighbor classifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/335893/","volume":"40","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4761535","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the finite sample performance of the nearest neighbor classifier","sourcePdf":"00335893.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028847S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"25","articleId":"335893","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":335894,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Previous results have indicated that the maximal value of m, such that almost all m vectors are stable points of the memory, in probability (i.e., with probability approaching one as n approaches infinity), is n/(2 log n)(n/(4 log n) if all m vectors must be stable simultaneously, in probability). Previous work further analyzed the direct convergence (i.e., convergence in one iteration) error-correcting power of the Hopfield memory. The present authors rigorously analyze the general case of nondirect convergence, and prove that in the m=n/(2 log n) case, independently of the operation mode used (synchronous or asynchronous), almost all memories have an attraction radius of size n/2 around them (in the n/(4 log n) case, all memories have such an attraction radius, in probability). This result, which was conjectured in the past but was never proved rigorously, combined with an old converse result that the network cannot store more than n/(2 log n)(n/(4 log n)) fundamental memories, gives a full picture of the error-correcting power of the Hebbian Hopfield network. The authors also upper bound the number of iterations required to achieve convergence.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.335894","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/7892/00335894.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.335894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7892","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"838","endPage":"847","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Nondirect convergence radius and number of iterations of the Hopfield associative memory","volume":"40","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4761536","publicationDate":"May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/335894/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nondirect convergence radius and number of iterations of the Hopfield associative memory","sourcePdf":"00335894.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034201S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"16","articleId":"335894","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":335895,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The SVQ structure allows the TB-SVQ to realize a large boundary gain while the underlying trellis code enables it to achieve a significant portion of the total granular gain. For large block-lengths and powerful (possibly complex) trellis codes the TB-SVQ can, in principle, achieve the rate-distortion bound.

The counting technique used to obtain this result also shows that \"state independent decoding\" can be achieved using not more than three codewords per message. Previously, it was not known beforehand that one could use fewer codewords per message than there were principal states. The counting technique also allows one to compare the principal state method with other practical schemes originating from the work of Tang and Bahl (1970) and allows one to use an efficient enumerative coding implementation of the encoder and decoder.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.335906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7892","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.335906","endPage":"941","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/7892/00335906.pdf","startPage":"934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the principal state method for run-length limited sequences","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/335906/","displayDocTitle":"On the principal state method for run-length limited sequences","volume":"40","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4761548","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the principal state method for run-length limited sequences","sourcePdf":"00335906.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027996S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"3","articleId":"335906","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":335907,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The propagation delay in the wires varies and results in asynchronous reception. The challenge is to find an efficient communication scheme that will be delay-insensitive. One of the common solutions to this problem is to use a handshake mechanism. Namely, the transmitter sends the next vector only after getting an acknowledgment that the current vector was received. A natural question is: how does the receiver know that reception of the current vector is complete? This problem was solved by Verhoeff (1988) by using the so-called unordered codes. However, in practice, it is common that the communication lines are arranged in pairs (double-rail) such that the propagation delay on the lines within a pair is identical. In general, the lines can be arranged in groups (of size larger than 1) where transmission within a group is synchronized. The authors have created a few delay-insensitive schemes that take advantage of partial synchronization within groups. To achieve that, they have generalized to arbitrary alphabets the following known results: Sperner's theorem on unordered sets, Henry-Knuth's (Henry, 1982; Knuth, 1986) construction of balanced codes, and Berger's (1961) construction of unordered codes. Finally, they have focused on practice, and constructed a code that uses double-rail channels but has the advantage that it is a rate 3/4 code as opposed to the rate 1/2 double-rail code (that is the common code being used in real systems).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.335907","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/7892/00335907.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.335907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7892","startPage":"941","endPage":"945","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coding for delay-insensitive communication with partial synchronization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=335907","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Coding for delay-insensitive communication with partial synchronization","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/335907/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4761549","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding for delay-insensitive communication with partial synchronization","sourcePdf":"00335907.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060851S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"5","articleId":"335907","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":335910,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

The information rate /spl Iscr/ carried by these binary samples is investigated. It is shown by constructing a specific nonstationary, bounded, bandlimited process (the real zeros of which are independent and identically distributed, isolated, and lying in different Nyquist intervals) that /spl Iscr/=log/sub 2/(n+1) bits per Nyquist interval is achievable. A more complicated construction in which L distinct zeros are placed in L consecutive Nyquist intervals yields achievable rates that approach (for L/spl rarr//spl infin/) /spl Iscr/ arbitrarily closely, where /spl Iscr/=log/sub 2/n + (n-1)log/sub 2/[n/(n-1)], n/spl ges/2 (and /spl Iscr/=1 for n=1 and L=1). By exploiting the constraints imposed on the autocorrelation function of a stationary sign (bilevel) process with a given average transition rate, the latter expression is shown also to yield an upper bound on the achievable values of /spl Iscr/. The logarithmic behavior with n (n/spl Gt/1) is due to the high correlation between the oversampled binary samples, and it is established that this trend is also achievable with stationary sign processes. This model may be used to gain insight into the effect of finite resolution on the information (in Shannon's sense) conveyed by the sign of a bandlimited process, and also to assess the limiting performance of certain oversampling-based communication systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/335948/","volume":"40","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4802516","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Information rates by oversampling the sign of a bandlimited process","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information rates by oversampling the sign of a bandlimited process","sourcePdf":"00335948.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031799S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"57","articleId":"335948","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":335955,"authors":[{"name":"A.

For the very high-rate range these codes approach the sphere-packing bound on the minimum Lee distance. Furthermore, for a given r, the length range of these codes is twice as large as that attainable by Berlekamp's (1984) extended negacyclic codes. The authors present an efficient decoding procedure, based on Euclid's algorithm, for correcting up to r-1 errors and detecting r errors, that is, up to the number of Lee errors guaranteed by the designed minimum Lee distance 2r. Bounds on the minimum Lee distance for r/spl ges/(p+1)/2 are provided for the Reed-Solomon case, i.e., when the BCH code roots are in GF(p). The authors present two applications. First, Lee-metric BCH codes can be used for protecting against bitshift errors and synchronization errors caused by insertion and/or deletion of zeros in (d, k)-constrained channels. Second, the code construction with its decoding algorithm can be formulated over the integer ring, providing an algebraic approach to correcting errors in partial-response channels where matched spectral-null codes are used.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.335966","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/7893/00335966.pdf","startPage":"1083","endPage":"1096","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7893","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.335966","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lee-metric BCH codes and their application to constrained and partial-response channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=335966","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Lee-metric BCH codes and their application to constrained and partial-response channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/335966/","publicationDate":"July 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4802498","volume":"40","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lee-metric BCH codes and their application to constrained and partial-response channels","sourcePdf":"00335966.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077071S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"66","articleId":"335966","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":335968,"authors":[{"name":"R.H.-H.

A new coding scheme based on convolutional codes on the ring of integers modulo-P is shown to be a natural way to apply trellis coding to CPFSK. Previous work has decomposed CPFSK into two parts: a linear encoder, with memory called the continuous phase encoder (CPE), and a memoryless modulator (MM), where the CPE often has a code structure defined over the ring of integers modulo-P. The combination of a modulo-P convolutional channel encoder (CE) and the CPE is a linear modulo-P encoder. Design examples are given for rate-1/2 coded quaternary CPFSK with modulation indexes 1/2 and 1/4, and rate-2/3 coded octal CPFSK with modulation index 1/8. Combinations are optimized in the normalized minimum Euclidean distance sense for a given total number of states in the overall MLSE receiver.

This scheme is motivated by a type of structured vector quantizer for memoryless sources, and results in N-sphere shaping of N-dimensional cubic lattice-based constellations. Because N-sphere shaping is optimal in N dimensions, shaping gains higher than those of N-dimensional Voronoi constellations can be realized. While optimal shaping for a large N can realize most of the 1.53 dB total shaping gain, it has the undesirable effect of increasing the size and the peak-to-average power ratio of the constituent 2D constellation. This limits its usefulness for many real world channels which have nonlinearities. The proposed scheme alleviates this problem by achieving optimal constellation shapes for a given limit on the constellation expansion ratio or the peak-to-average power ratio of the constituent 2D constellation. Results of Calderbank and Ozarow (1990) on nonequiprobable signaling are used to reduce the complexity of this scheme and make it independent of the data rate with essentially no effect on the shaping gain.

Both constructions are based upon the projection of the Golay code and the Leech lattice onto the (6,3,4) hexacode over GF(4). However, unlike the previously reported constructions, the new multilevel constructions make the three levels independent by way of using a different set of coset representatives for one of the quaternary coordinates. Based upon the multilevel structure of the Golay code and the Leech lattice, efficient bounded-distance decoding algorithms are devised. The bounded-distance decoder for the binary Golay code requires at most 431 operations. As compared to 651 operations for the best known maximum-likelihood decoder. Efficient bounded-distance decoding of the Leech lattice is achieved by means of partitioning it into four cosets of Q/sub 24/, beyond the conventional partition into two H/sub 24/ cosets. The complexity of the resulting decoder is only 953 real operations on the average and 1007 operations in the worst case, as compared to about 3600 operations for the best known in maximum-likelihood decoder. It is shown that the proposed algorithms decode correctly at least up to the guaranteed error-correction radius of the maximum-likelihood decoder. Thus, the loss in coding-gain is due primarily to an increase in the effective error-coefficient, which is calculated exactly for both algorithms. Furthermore, the performance of the Leech lattice decoder on the AWGN channel is evaluated experimentally by means of a comprehensive computer simulation. The results show a loss in coding-gain of less than 0.1 dB relative to the maximum-likelihood decoder for BER ranging from 10/sup -1/ to 10/sup -7/.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/335970/","volume":"40","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4802494","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Leech lattice and the Golay code: bounded-distance decoding and multilevel constructions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Leech lattice and the Golay code: bounded-distance decoding and multilevel constructions","sourcePdf":"00335970.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060677S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"39","articleId":"335970","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":335971,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Specifically, an nth-order expansion is developed for the error in the wavelet approximation at resolution 2/sup -l/ of deterministic and random signals. The deterministic signals are assumed to have n continuous derivatives, while the random signals are only assumed to have a correlation function with continuous nth-order derivatives off the diagonal-a very mild assumption. For deterministic signals square integrable over the entire real line, for stationary random signals over finite intervals, and for nonstationary random signals with finite mean energy over the entire real line, the smoothness of the scale function can be matched with the signal smoothness to substantially improve the quality of the approximation. In sharp contrast, this is feasible only in special cases for nonstationary random signals over finite intervals and for deterministic signals which are only locally square integrable.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/335971/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4802493","volume":"40","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet approximation of deterministic and random signals: convergence properties and rates","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet approximation of deterministic and random signals: convergence properties and rates","sourcePdf":"00335971.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035213S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"30","articleId":"335971","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":335973,"authors":[{"name":"Gui-Liang Feng","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Southwestern Louisiana, Lafayette, LA, USA"],"lastName":"Gui-Liang Feng","id":"37087433015"},{"name":"V.K.

For codes from a large class of irreducible plane curves, including Hermitian curves, it can correct up to [(d*-1)/2] errors, where d* is the designed minimum distance. With it we also obtain a proof of d/sub min//spl ges/d* without directly using the Riemann-Roch theorem. The algorithm consists of Gaussian elimination on a specially arranged syndrome matrix, followed by a novel majority voting scheme. A fast implementation incorporating block Hankel matrix techniques is obtained whose worst-case running time is O(mn/sup 2/), where m is the degree of the curve. Applications of our techniques to decoding other algebraic-geometric codes, to decoding BCH codes to actual minimum distance, and to two-dimensional shift register synthesis are also presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Error correction codes","Algorithm design and analysis","Reed-Solomon codes","Voting","Shift registers","Computer science","Computer errors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BCH codes","decoding","majority logic","matrix algebra","binary sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebraic-geometric codes","irreducible plane curves","decoding algorithm","Hermitian curves","minimum distance","Gaussian elimination","syndrome matrix","majority voting","block Hankel matrix","worst-case running time","BCH codes","two-dimensional shift register synthesis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=335973","doi":"10.1109/18.335973","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/7893/00335973.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.335973","startPage":"981","endPage":"1002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7893","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simplified understanding and efficient decoding of a class of algebraic-geometric codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Simplified understanding and efficient decoding of a class of algebraic-geometric codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/335973/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","volume":"40","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4802491","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simplified understanding and efficient decoding of a class of algebraic-geometric codes","sourcePdf":"00335973.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041072S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"38","articleId":"335973","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":336012,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

This approach uses a single wavelength to carry capacities of at least 40 Gb/s. Such systems are based on a clock frequency and tributary data rates which are easily accessible using electronic components. Short optical pulses are used in a return-to-zero data transmission format with temporal interleaving to map a number of optical data channels into a single electronic clock cycle.

This model is particularly suited for application to power system scheduling models that are based on dual formulation (i.e. price-based). In this model, the impact of binding ramp-rate limits is reflected via the hourly marginal ramp-rate values ($/MW-Hr) of generators.

Expert systems are being considered for restoring bulk power supplies. In general, there are three restoration periods following a major power disturbance: establishment of initial sources of power, re-integration of a skeleton of the bulk power supply, and minimization of the unserved loads. Expert systems together with analytical tools have the potential of addressing the restoration procedures over these three periods.

A procedure is developed for identifying a frequency-dependent composite load model using digital measurements from an on-line transient recording system, taking account of system frequency variation. A nonlinear model parameter estimation technique is described to derive the frequency-dependent load model. A computer program called LMSP has been developed. The program consists of five major phases: user-interface, data manipulation, load model identification; model conversion and system model response evaluation. A case study is presented to illustrate, in particular, the accuracy of the developed model for the representation of dynamic load behaviors of an actual power system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.336105","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/7897/00336105.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.336105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7897","startPage":"1546","endPage":"1556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a frequency-dependent composite load model using the measurement approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=336105","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Development of a frequency-dependent composite load model using the measurement approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/336105/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4768492","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a frequency-dependent composite load model using the measurement approach","sourcePdf":"00336105.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038634S","chronDate":"Aug.  1994","isNumber":"7897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"36","articleId":"336105","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":336106,"authors":[{"name":"C.

An iterative procedure is employed to coordinate the unit commitment and the power dispatch for obtaining an economical solution within a reasonable time. The Lagrangian relaxation method is used to generate the unit commitment schedule with relaxed power balance constraints. A network model is adopted to represent the dynamic process of operating a unit over the entire study time span, as the required unit commitment schedule can be achieved by searching for the shortest path in the network. In order to find the global optimal solution for the economic dispatch problem within personal computer resources, a piecewise linear model is used for thermal units. Furthermore, linear programming is used in optimizing the benefits of ramping the units, with low operating cost against the cost of shortening the service life of the turbine rotor. In this regard, linear programming is used to dispatch the power generation among committed units by considering a ramping penalty for the fatigue effect in rotor shafts, while preserving the operational constraints of the system as well as the generating units.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.336106","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/7897/00336106.pdf","startPage":"1539","endPage":"1545","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.336106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7897","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ramp-rate limits in unit commitment and economic dispatch incorporating rotor fatigue effect","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=336106","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/336106/","displayDocTitle":"Ramp-rate limits in unit commitment and economic dispatch incorporating rotor fatigue effect","volume":"9","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4768491","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ramp-rate limits in unit commitment and economic dispatch incorporating rotor fatigue effect","sourcePdf":"00336106.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045782S","chronDate":"Aug.  1994","isNumber":"7897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"127","articleId":"336106","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":336110,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.

The algorithms attempt to reduce the production of atmospheric emissions such as NO/sub x/ and SO/sub x/ caused by the operation of fossil-fueled thermal generation.

Obviously the character of the power systems have changed and yet no corresponding modification of ULFS has been made and there is still shedding of pre-selected loads throughout the entire power system. This paper proposes a new scheme utilising frequency and voltage changes to shed loads specifically in the most affected localities while regaining the load-generation balance for each incident. Simulation studies on an extensive interconnected network, following very severe loss of generation, show the advantages of the proposed scheme to the actions of existing ULFS.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.336128","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/7897/00336128.pdf","startPage":"1371","endPage":"1378","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.336128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7897","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new load shedding scheme for limiting underfrequency","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/336128/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1994","displayDocTitle":"A new load shedding scheme for limiting underfrequency","volume":"9","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4768469","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new load shedding scheme for limiting underfrequency","sourcePdf":"00336128.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029359S","chronDate":"Aug.  1994","isNumber":"7897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"89","articleId":"336128","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":336130,"authors":[{"name":"T.J.

Since these cases can represent the most severe threats to viable system operation, it is important that a computationally efficient technique be developed to both quantify the degree of unsolvability, and to provide optimal recommendations of the parameters to change to return to a solvable solution. Such an algorithm is developed in the paper. The distance in parameter space between the desired operating point and the closest solvable operating point provides a measure of the degree of unsolvability, with the difference between these two points providing the optimal system parameter changes. The algorithm is based upon a Newton-Raphson power flow algorithm, which provides both computational efficiency and compatibility with existing security analysis techniques. The method is demonstrated on systems of up to 118 buses.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/7897/00336130.pdf","startPage":"1359","endPage":"1365","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/59.336130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.336130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7897","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=336130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A power flow measure for unsolvable cases","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load flow","Power measurement","Fluid flow measurement","Power system analysis computing","Power system planning","Power system measurements","Equations","Load flow analysis","Computational efficiency","Power system security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power systems","load flow","numerical analysis","bifurcation","optimisation","power system planning","power system control","power system protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power flow","power systems","heavy loading","contingency analysis","planning","computational efficiency","unsolvability","algorithm","parameter space","operating point","optimisation","Newton-Raphson method","security analysis","buses"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/336130/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1994","displayDocTitle":"A power flow measure for unsolvable cases","volume":"9","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4768467","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A power flow measure for unsolvable cases","sourcePdf":"00336130.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050462S","chronDate":"Aug.  1994","isNumber":"7897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"141","articleId":"336130","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":336133,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

This paper presents an extended quadratic interior point (EQIP) method, based on improvement of initial condition for solving both linear and quadratic programming problems, to solve power system optimization problem (PSOP), such as economic dispatch (ED) and VAr planning (VP) problems. The EQIP method is able to accommodate the nonlinearity in objectives and constraints. The scheme is demonstrated on several IEEE standard systems and is capable of achieving fast convergence and improvement in computational speed over an existing efficient Simplex, such as the MINOS code. The number of iterations during the computation is relatively insensitive to numbers of controls and constraints. Moreover, the proposed EQIP method guarantees a global optimum within the interior feasible region.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/336133/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1994","volume":"9","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4768464","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The quadratic interior point method solving power system optimization problems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The quadratic interior point method solving power system optimization problems","sourcePdf":"00336133.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04664S","chronDate":"Aug.  1994","isNumber":"7897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"115","articleId":"336133","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":336134,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.O.

This procedure is illustrated by application to the hypothetical test system designated as the RBTS.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Risk management","Power systems","Power transmission lines","Power generation","Interconnected systems","System testing","Distributed parameter circuits","Power system reliability","Stochastic systems","Spinning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["risk management","power transmission lines","power stations","load dispatching","power system planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["operating reserve risk assessment","composite power systems","composite generation/transmission systems","risk constrained unit commitment","common mode failures","transmission lines","station initiated outages","hypothetical test system"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7897","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.336140","startPage":"1270","endPage":"1276","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/7897/00336140.pdf","doi":"10.1109/59.336140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Operating reserve risk assessment in composite power systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Operating reserve risk assessment in composite power systems","accessionNumber":"4768457","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","volume":"9","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/336140/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Operating reserve risk assessment in composite power systems","sourcePdf":"00336140.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037567S","chronDate":"Aug.  1994","isNumber":"7897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"20","articleId":"336140","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":336142,"authors":[{"name":"Shun Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shun Lee","id":"37087482321"},{"name":"Chun-Chang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chun-Chang Liu","id":"37087182013"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8950"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0679"}],"articleNumber":"336142","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":187},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=336142","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Resonance","Shunt (electrical)","Inductors","Pressure control","Turbines","Time series analysis","Performance analysis","Signal design","Signal generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping","controllers","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","two-term control","reactors (electric)","feedback","compensation","fast Fourier transforms","time-domain analysis","power system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subsynchronous resonance damping","SIMO shunt reactor controller","torsional oscillations stabilisation","single-input multiple-output","eigenstructure assignment technique","multiple-proportional-integral controller","medium pressure turbine speed","low pressure turbine speeds","generator shaft speed","feedback signals","series compensation degrees","time domain simulations","pulsed torque disturbance","fast-Fourier-transform"]}],"abstract":"Stabilizing torsional oscillations using a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) shunt reactor controller is investigated in this paper.

Taken together, these two facts constitute a paradox. A second paradox is that almost all of the successful fuzzy logic applications are embedded controllers, while most of the theoretical papers on fuzzy methods deal with knowledge representation and reasoning. I hope to resolve these paradoxes by identifying which aspects of fuzzy logic render it useful in practice, and which aspects are inessential. My conclusions are based on a mathematical result, on a survey of literature on the use of fuzzy logic in heuristic control and in expert systems, and on practical experience in developing expert systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/336150/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1994","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4827000","volume":"9","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The paradoxical success of fuzzy logic","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The paradoxical success of fuzzy logic","sourcePdf":"00336150.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110712S","chronDate":"Aug.  1994","isNumber":"7898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"64","citationCount":"103","articleId":"336150","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":336225,"authors":[{"name":"E.A.

Residual boundary reflection sometimes causes serious degradation of the computed parameters (e.g. oscillatory behaviour). We introduce a simple modification of the FDTD implementation for microstrip discontinuities, wherein two sub-problems whose domains are reduced by bringing the absorbing boundary close to the circuit, are superposed to cancel the dominant boundary reflection. Computed results on transmission line and resonant type discontinuities demonstrate that significant computational savings can be achieved without compromising accuracy.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/75/7900/00336227.pdf","startPage":"402","endPage":"404","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","doi":"10.1109/75.336227","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/75.336227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7900","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=336227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple technique for minimization of ABC-induced error in the FDTD analysis of microstrip discontinuities","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Microstrip","Reflection","Transmission line discontinuities","Minimization","Computational modeling","Circuit simulation","Degradation","Distributed parameter circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","errors","microstrip discontinuities","waveguide theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ABC-induced error minimisation","FDTD analysis","microstrip discontinuities","imperfectly absorbing truncation boundaries","simulation","microstrip circuits","finite-difference time-domain method","residual boundary reflection","dominant boundary reflection","transmission line discontinuities","resonant type discontinuities"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/336227/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","displayDocTitle":"A simple technique for minimization of ABC-induced error in the FDTD analysis of microstrip discontinuities","volume":"4","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4856342","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple technique for minimization of ABC-induced error in the FDTD analysis of microstrip discontinuities","sourcePdf":"00336227.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048771S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"7900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"75","citationCount":"11","articleId":"336227","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":336244,"authors":[{"name":"R.

They describe a signal by the power at each scale and position. Edges can be located very effectively in the wavelet transform domain. A spatially selective noise filtration technique based on the direct spatial correlation of the wavelet transform at several adjacent scales is introduced. A high correlation is used to infer that there is a significant feature at the position that should be passed through the filter. The authors have tested the technique on simulated signals, phantom images, and real MR images. It is found that the technique can reduce noise contents in signals and images by more than 80% while maintaining at least 80% of the value of the gradient at most edges. The authors did not observe any Gibbs' ringing or significant resolution loss on the filtered images. Artifacts that arose from the filtration are very small and local. The noise filtration technique is quite robust. There are many possible extensions of the technique. The authors see its applications in spatially dependent noise filtration, edge detection and enhancement, image restoration, and motion artifact removal. They have compared the performance of the technique to that of the Weiner filter and found it to be superior.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.336245","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","startPage":"747","endPage":"758","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/7901/00336245.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.336245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7901","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet transform domain filters: a spatially selective noise filtration technique","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet domain","Wavelet transforms","Filters","Filtration","Spatial resolution","Image resolution","Signal resolution","Image edge detection","Wavelet analysis","Image analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transforms","edge detection","filtering theory","image restoration","image enhancement","medical image processing","medical signal processing","correlation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transform domain filters","spatially selective noise filtration technique","multiresolution decompositions","direct spatial correlation","simulated signals","phantom images","real MR images","noise content","resolution","filtered images","artifacts","noise filtration technique","spatially dependent noise filtration","edge detection","enhancement","image restoration","motion artifact removal"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet transform domain filters: a spatially selective noise filtration technique","volume":"3","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4833140","pubMedId":"18296244","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/336245/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet transform domain filters: a spatially selective noise filtration technique","sourcePdf":"00336245.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035525S","chronDate":"Nov.  1994","isNumber":"7901","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"492","articleId":"336245","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":336246,"authors":[{"name":"L.H.

A 3D isotropic wavelet is used to approximate the difference-of-Gaussians (D-o-G) operator. Convolution of the image with dilated versions of the wavelet produces three band-pass signals that approximate multiscale smoothed second derivatives. An additional convolution of the image with a Gaussian-shaped low-pass wavelet creates a fourth subband signal that preserves low-frequency information not described by the three band-pass signals. The authors show that the original image can be recovered from the watershed and watercourse lines of the three band-pass signals plus the lowpass subband signal. By thresholding the watershed/watercourse representation, subsampling the low-pass subband, and using edge post emphasis, the authors achieve data reduction with little loss of fidelity. Further compression of the watersheds and watercourses is achieved by chain coding their shapes and predictive coding their amplitudes prior to lossless arithmetic coding. Results are presented for grey-level test images at data rates between 0.1 and 0.3 b/pixel.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.336246","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","startPage":"759","endPage":"772","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/7901/00336246.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.336246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7901","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subband image coding using watershed and watercourse lines of the wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Wavelet transforms","Filters","Shape","Humans","Convolution","Interpolation","Spatial resolution","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","arithmetic codes","wavelet transforms","Gaussian processes","convolution","data compression","image representation","prediction theory","image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subband image coding","watershed lines","watercourse lines","wavelet transform","primitive-based image coding","nonorthogonal dyadic wavelets","3D isotropic wavelet","difference-of-Gaussians operator","convolution","bandpass signals","multiscale smoothed second derivatives","Gaussian-shaped low-pass wavelet","low-frequency information","lowpass subband signal","thresholding","subsampling","data reduction","fidelity","chain coding","predictive coding","amplitudes","lossless arithmetic coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Subband image coding using watershed and watercourse lines of the wavelet transform","volume":"3","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4833141","pubMedId":"18296245","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/336246/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subband image coding using watershed and watercourse lines of the wavelet transform","sourcePdf":"00336246.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03849S","chronDate":"Nov.  1994","isNumber":"7901","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"14","articleId":"336246","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":336248,"authors":[{"name":"M.A.T.

For images degraded by linear blur and contaminated by additive white Gaussian noise, maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation and regularization theory lead to the same high dimension convex optimization problem. The commonly adopted strategy (in using neural networks for image restoration) is to map the objective function of the optimization problem into the energy of a predefined network, taking advantage of its energy minimization properties. Departing from this approach, we propose neural implementations of iterative minimization algorithms which are first proved to converge. The developed schemes are based on modified Hopfield (1985) networks of graded elements, with both sequential and parallel updating schedules. An algorithm supported on a fully standard Hopfield network (binary elements and zero autoconnections) is also considered. Robustness with respect to finite numerical precision is studied, and examples with real images are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.336248","startPage":"789","endPage":"801","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/7901/00336248.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.336248","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7901","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential and parallel image restoration: neural network implementations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image restoration","Neural networks","Iterative algorithms","Degradation","Additive white noise","Estimation theory","Iterative methods","Minimization methods","Image converters","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image restoration","Hopfield neural nets","parallel algorithms","Gaussian noise","white noise","iterative methods","minimisation","convergence of numerical methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel image restoration","sequential image restoration","neural network","image restoration algorithms","linear blur","additive white Gaussian noise","maximum a posteriori estimation","MAP estimation","regularization theory","convex optimization problem","iterative minimization algorithms","modified Hopfield networks","graded elements","parallel updating schedules","sequential updating schedules","binary elements","robustness","finite numerical precision","degraded images"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/336248/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Sequential and parallel image restoration: neural network implementations","volume":"3","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4833143","pubMedId":"18296247","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential and parallel image restoration: neural network implementations","sourcePdf":"00336248.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050973S","chronDate":"Nov.  1994","isNumber":"7901","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"21","articleId":"336248","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":336250,"authors":[{"name":"M.R.

This formulation allows for the decomposition of both the convolution operator and the signal in the subband domain. With this approach, any single channel linear space-invariant filtering problem can be cast into a multichannel framework. We apply this decomposition to the linear space-invariant image restoration problem and propose a family of multichannel linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) restoration filters. These filters explicitly incorporate both within and between subband (channel) relations of the decomposed image. Since only within channel stationarity is assumed in the image model, this approach presents a new method for modeling the nonstationarity of images. Experimental results are presented which test the proposed multichannel LMMSE filters. These experiments show that if accurate estimates of the subband statistics are available, the proposed multichannel filters provide major improvements over the traditional single channel filters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.336250","startPage":"821","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/7901/00336250.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.336250","endPage":"833","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7901","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multichannel restoration of single channel images using a wavelet-based subband decomposition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/336250/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Multichannel restoration of single channel images using a wavelet-based subband decomposition","volume":"3","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4833145","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","pubMedId":"18296249","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multichannel restoration of single channel images using a wavelet-based subband decomposition","sourcePdf":"00336250.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121238S","chronDate":"Nov.  1994","isNumber":"7901","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"39","articleId":"336250","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":336324,"authors":[{"name":"R.O.

We consider an architecture in which each input port maintains a separate queue for each output.

We demonstrate the fairness properties of the 2DRR scheduler and compare its performance with that of the input and output queueing configurations, showing that our scheme achieves the same saturation throughput as output queueing.

As well as more sophisticated mechanisms to gather and cross-correlate information.

Accurate characterization of the multimedia traffic is essential, in ATM networks, in order to develop a robust set of traffic descriptors. Such set is required, by the usage parameter control (UPC) algorithm, for traffic enforcement (policing). In this paper, we present a novel approach to characterize and model the multimedia traffic using neural networks (NNs). A backpropagation neural network is used to characterize and predict the statistical variations of the packet arrival process resulting from the superposition of N packetized video sources and M packetized voice sources. The accuracy of the results were verified by matching the index of dispersion for counts (IDC), the variance, and the autocorrelation of the arrival process to those of the NN output. The reported results show that the NNs can be successfully utilized to characterize the complex non-renewal process with extreme accuracy.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GDN.1993.336583","startPage":"77","endPage":"84","publicationTitle":"First IEEE Symposium on Global Data Networking","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GDN.1993.336583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7907","displayPublicationTitle":"First IEEE Symposium on Global Data Networking","pdfPath":"/iel2/925/7907/00336583.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ATM multimedia traffic prediction using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/336583/","displayDocTitle":"ATM multimedia traffic prediction using neural networks","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4805853","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-15 Dec. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Dec. 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ATM multimedia traffic prediction using neural networks","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"00336583.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05331S","chronDate":"12-15 Dec. 1993","isNumber":"7907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"925","citationCount":"15","articleId":"336583","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":336612,"authors":[{"name":"R.K.

A new approach of combining several different multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network classifiers operating on the same image is developed. The classification decisions made by individual MLPs are combined through a method called \"behavior-knowledge space\" (BKS). The BKS method relies on the behavior of the classifiers on the training set. The pseudo-Zernike moments extracted from the normalized and thinned image of the digit within its bounding circle are used as features. The approach is tested on 3000 digits using three classifiers and a hard error rate of 1.37% is obtained. This is a reduction of almost 50% compared to a single MLP network classifier.

The key feature of the algorithm is the adaptive objective mechanism governed by the combination of global and local measures. As hardware area minimization and latency constraints present contradictory objectives, a global time-criticality (GC) measure selects an objective function in accordance with feasibility. In addition to global consideration, local characteristics of the nodes are emphasized by classifying nodes into local phase (LP) types. A local phase 1 node (extremity) has an obvious preference for an implementation on the basis of its area/time requirements. A local phase 2 node (repeller) is a repeller to an implementation on the basis of relative preferences of other nodes. At each iteration, the global and local criteria are superimposed by a threshold mechanism so as to determine the best implementation. The algorithm has quadratic complexity in the number of nodes and has shown promising behaviour on the examples tested.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/HSC.1994.336724","publicationTitle":"Third International Workshop on Hardware/Software Codesign","displayPublicationTitle":"Third International Workshop on Hardware/Software Codesign","pdfPath":"/iel2/991/7910/00336724.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HSC.1994.336724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7910","startPage":"42","endPage":"48","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A global criticality/local phase driven algorithm for the constrained hardware/software partitioning problem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=336724","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A global criticality/local phase driven algorithm for the constrained hardware/software partitioning problem","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/336724/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4779042","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A global criticality/local phase driven algorithm for the constrained hardware/software partitioning problem","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"00336724.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029596S","chronDate":"22-24 Sep 1994","isNumber":"7910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"991","citationCount":"84","articleId":"336724","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":336725,"authors":[{"name":"J.G.

The abstraction level we have adopted is referred to as the configuration level, where hardware is modeled as resources with no detailed functionality and software is modeled as tasks utilizing the resources. Through configuration-level analysis, cost and performance tradeoffs can be studied early in the design process and a large design space can be explored. Feasibility factor is introduced to measure the possibility of a real-time system being feasible, and is used as both a constraint and an attribute during the optimization process. Optimal partitioning is achieved through the use of an existing computer-aided design tool.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Configuration-level hardware/software partitioning for real-time embedded systems","publicationTitle":"Third International Workshop on Hardware/Software Codesign","doi":"10.1109/HSC.1994.336725","displayPublicationTitle":"Third International Workshop on Hardware/Software Codesign","pdfPath":"/iel2/991/7910/00336725.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"41","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HSC.1994.336725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=336725","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/336725/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Configuration-level hardware/software partitioning for real-time embedded systems","conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4779041","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Configuration-level hardware/software partitioning for real-time embedded systems","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"00336725.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035345S","chronDate":"22-24 Sep 1994","isNumber":"7910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"991","citationCount":"45","articleId":"336725","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":336864,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The idea is to find some features from the image object in order to build an index search structure. For the sake of similarity matching among shapes, the features must be invariant to rotation, translation and scaling. We propose a set of generic features that are invariant to these transformations. Each feature in the feature vector is associated with a weight based on the application, which is used in the search process. Any multidimensional point access method can then be used to build an index. In this paper, a variant of the K-D-B tree is used to construct the index structure. Finally, we define a similarity measure to find objects similar to a given query object, and discuss how similarity queries can be processed using the index structure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/336942/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sep 1994","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4785278","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A framework for feature-based indexing for spatial databases","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A framework for feature-based indexing for spatial databases","confLoc":"Charlottesville, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00336942.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029471S","chronDate":"28-30 Sep 1994","isNumber":"7914","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1006","citationCount":"5","articleId":"336942","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":337023,"authors":[{"name":"F.H.

Several sky-wave over-the-horizon radar (OTHR) systems have been successfully implemented and the detection of targets located up to approximately 3500 km from the radar location has been demonstrated. The Jindalee Operational Radar Network (JORN) is an over the horizon HF sky-wave radar system currently being developed for the Commonwealth of Australia. The prime contractor is Telecom Australia and GEC-Marconi have been subcontracted to design the radar. The GEC-Marconi Research Centre have been developing some of the critical components of the final radar system. One of the most critical components in any HF sky-wave radar system is a model of the ionosphere. A model of the ionosphere is necessary so that geographic target positions can be inferred from measured radar returns using raytracing techniques. This process is known as coordinate registration (CR). This paper describes an ionospheric model developed for use in the JORN and outlines how this model fits into the overall CR process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7915","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:19940504","publicationTitle":"1994 Sixth International Conference on HF Radio Systems and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 Sixth International Conference on HF Radio Systems and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel3/1166/7915/00337057.pdf","startPage":"258","endPage":"266","doi":"10.1049/cp:19940504","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ionospheric modelling and target coordinate registration for HF sky-wave radars","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Ionospheric modelling and target coordinate registration for HF sky-wave radars","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 July 1994","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4805955","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/337057/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ionospheric modelling and target coordinate registration for HF sky-wave radars","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"00337057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025607S","chronDate":"4-7 Jul 1994","isNumber":"7915","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1166","citationCount":"12","articleId":"337057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":337435,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The model is based on deriving the currents of the HPT and the feedback current of the LAOS. The feedback currents for optical and/or electrical feedback are determined by solving the continuity equation in the collector and the base of the HPT. A negative resistance region in the I-V curve is obtained and controlled by varying the feedback coefficient of the device and the Early effect coefficient. The main factors affecting the negative resistance region are the feedback coefficient, Early effect, the recombination currents in the emitter-base space-charge region, and the ratio of the collector to base doping.

The validity and limitations of the universal relationship between the inversion layer mobility and the effective normal field (E/sub eff/) are examined. It is found that the universality of both the electron and hole mobilities does hold up to 10/sup 18/ cm/sup -3/. The E/sub eff/ dependences of the universal curves are observed to differ between electrons and holes, particularly at lower temperatures. This result means a different influence of surface roughness scattering on the electron and hole transports. On substrates with higher impurity concentrations, the electron and hole mobilities significantly deviate from the universal curves at lower surface carrier concentrations because of Coulomb scattering by the substrate impurity. Also, the deviation caused by the charged centers at the Si/SiO/sub 2/ interface is observed in the mobility of MOSFET's degraded by Fowler-Nordheim electron injection.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/337449/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4854396","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"41","issue":"12","displayDocTitle":"On the universality of inversion layer mobility in Si MOSFET's: Part I-effects of substrate impurity concentration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the universality of inversion layer mobility in Si MOSFET's: Part I-effects of substrate impurity concentration","sourcePdf":"00337449.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032891S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7923","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"1136","articleId":"337449","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":337456,"authors":[{"name":"G.G.

In order to minimize short channel effects, relatively thick nondepleted (0.15 /spl mu/m) SOI film, highly nonuniform channel doping and source-drain extension-halo were used. Excellent short channel effects (SCE) down to channel lengths below 0.1 /spl mu/m were obtained. It is shown that undepleted SOI results in better short channel effect when compared to ultrathin depleted SOI. Devices with little short channel effect all the way to below 500 /spl Aring/ effective channel length were obtained. Furthermore, utilization of source-drain extension-halo minimizes the bipolar effect inherent in the floating body. These devices were applied to a variety of circuits: Very high speeds were obtained: Unloaded delay was 20 ps, unloaded NAND (FI=FO=3) was 64 ps, and loaded NAND (FI=FO=3, C/sub L/=0.3 pF) delay was 130 ps at supply of 1.8 V.

By using a spatial mode-converter to selectively excite a higher order mode in specially designed multimode fiber, this dispersion can be used to compensate the positive dispersion in conventional single-mode fiber spans. In this paper, issues related to compensating fiber and mode-converter design are explored. Experimental measurements in specially designed two-mode fibers operated in LP/sub 11/ mode show negative dispersion as large as -70 ps/nm/spl middot/km at 1555 nm. Pulse propagation and system experiments employing spatial mode-converters to excite LP/sub 11/ mode in a two-mode fiber demonstrate the feasibility of this technique for dispersion compensation in lightwave systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/337486/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","volume":"12","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4820302","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Optical fiber-based dispersion compensation using higher order modes near cutoff","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical fiber-based dispersion compensation using higher order modes near cutoff","sourcePdf":"00337486.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050587S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"151","articleId":"337486","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":337494,"authors":[{"name":"G.K.

The dependence of the velocity match condition on electrode thickness and wall angle is demonstrated experimentally and with finite element calculations. A set of test electrode structures is fabricated to study electrical losses in the modulator electrode. Loss coefficients are assigned to different sections of the device, and dielectric and radiative losses are shown to play an important role at high frequencies. This information is used in conjunction with finite-element calculations to develop accurate models for both the electrical and optical responses. The frequency dependence of the half-wave voltage is measured and shown to be in good agreement with a model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/337494/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4820310","volume":"12","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance and modeling of broadband LiNbO/sub 3/ traveling wave optical intensity modulators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance and modeling of broadband LiNbO/sub 3/ traveling wave optical intensity modulators","sourcePdf":"00337494.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039732S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"163","articleId":"337494","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":337501,"authors":[{"name":"M.M.

The idea is to deliberately introduce independent random polarization fluctuations in the electric fields transmitted on each optical channel. Random polarization results in an expanded OBI spectrum, and hence, less OBI power at the reference user receiving filter output. Electro-optic phase modulation is used to introduce polarization randomness in the fields before they are coupled into the fibers, A two-user system was simulated. Simulation results show the drastic reduction in OBI power spectral density using appropriate PN signals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/337501/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4820317","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"12","issue":"10","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of optical beat interference in SCM/WDMA networks using pseudorandom phase modulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of optical beat interference in SCM/WDMA networks using pseudorandom phase modulation","sourcePdf":"00337501.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025847S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"19","articleId":"337501","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":337512,"authors":[{"name":"S.

One method of influencing the quality of service and the controllability of packet switched networks is queue scheduling. Unfortunately, defining an optimal queue scheduling method is highly dependent upon the cost function chosen for a particular switch implementation. Therefore, the authors propose a VLSI generic queue scheduler that can emulate a wide variety of queue scheduling methods. They implement the VLSI generic queue scheduler using a VLSI system synthesis tool, OASIS, and through measurements explore the size and speed of various system configurations. The process of employing some scheduling methods in this architecture is also detailed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1994.337539","startPage":"1438","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '94 Conference on Computer Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '94 Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/955/7926/00337539.pdf","endPage":"1445 vol.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7926","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1994.337539","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"12-16 June 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/337539/","displayDocTitle":"Generic queue scheduling: concepts and VLSI","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4731455","publicationDate":"1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generic queue scheduling: concepts and VLSI","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00337539.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075598S","chronDate":"12-16 Jun 1994","isNumber":"7926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"955","citationCount":"2","articleId":"337539","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":337544,"authors":[{"name":"J.

However, the widespread adoption of electronic distribution of copyrighted material is currently impeded by the ease of illicit copying and dissemination. The authors propose techniques that discourage illicit distribution by embedding each document with a unique codeword. The encoding techniques are indiscernible by readers, yet enable one to identify the sanctioned recipient of a document by examination of a recovered document.

The performance in terms of channel efficiency, delay and throughput is analysed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '94 Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/955/7926/00337566.pdf","startPage":"1244","endPage":"1251 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '94 Conference on Computer Communications","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1994.337566","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1994.337566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7926","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=337566","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time division multiplexed de Bruijn network and ShuffleNet for optical communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time division multiplexing","Wavelength division multiplexing","WDM networks","Optical fiber networks","Hardware","Costs","Optical transmitters","Delay","Throughput","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical links","time division multiplexing","switching networks","delays","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TDM de Bruijn network","TDM ShuffleNet","optical communications","TWDM ShuffleNet","hardware cost reduction","dilated slipped banyan networks","time division multiplexing","column control","dilated operation","free-space technology","guided-wave technology","transmitter","receiver","performance","channel efficiency","delay","throughput"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/337566/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Time division multiplexed de Bruijn network and ShuffleNet for optical communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4726140","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-16 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time division multiplexed de Bruijn network and ShuffleNet for optical communications","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00337566.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044648S","chronDate":"12-16 Jun 1994","isNumber":"7926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"955","citationCount":"4","articleId":"337566","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":337568,"authors":[{"name":"J.-C.

One way to support packet video in these networks is to use feedback mechanisms that adapt the output rate of video coders based on the state of the network. The authors present one such mechanism. They describe the feedback information, and how it is used by the coder control algorithm. They also examine how the need to operate in a multicast environment impacts the design of the control mechanism. This mechanism has been implemented in the H.261 video coder of IVS. IVS is a videoconference system for the Internet developed at INRIA. Experiments indicate that the control mechanism is well suited to the Internet environment. In particular, it makes it possible to establish and maintain quality videoconferences even across congested connections in the Internet. Furthermore, it prevents video sources from swamping the resources of the Internet, which could lead to unacceptable service to all users of the network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/337568/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4726138","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"12-16 June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A rate control mechanism for packet video in the Internet","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A rate control mechanism for packet video in the Internet","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00337568.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041071S","chronDate":"12-16 Jun 1994","isNumber":"7926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"955","citationCount":"86","articleId":"337568","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":337624,"authors":[{"name":"C.-S.

This almost-all-optical network will exploit wavelength multiplexers and optical switches in routing nodes, so that arbitrary virtual topologies may be imbedded on a given physical network. The virtual topology, which is packet switched and which consists of a set of all-optical lightpaths, is set up to exploit the relative strengths of both optics and electronics viz. packets of information are carried by the virtual topology \"as far as possible\" in the optical domain, but packet forwarding from lightpath to lightpath is performed via electronic switching, whenever required. Algorithms are developed so that the WDM-based network architecture will (a) provide a high aggregate system capacity due to spatial reuse of wavelengths, and (b) support a large and scalable number of users, given a limited number of wavelengths.

In such applications, received audio packets are buffered, and their playout delayed at the destination host in order to compensate for the variable network delays. The authors investigate the performance of four different algorithms for adaptively adjusting the playout delay of audio packets in an interactive packet-audio terminal application, in the face of such varying network delays. They evaluate the playout algorithms using experimentally-obtained delay measurements of audio traffic between several different Internet sites. Their results indicate that an adaptive algorithm which explicitly adjusts to the sharp, spike-like increases in packet delay which were observed in the traces can achieve a lower rate of lost packets for both a given average playout delay and a given maximum buffer size.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/337672/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4720940","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"12-16 June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive playout mechanisms for packetized audio applications in wide-area networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive playout mechanisms for packetized audio applications in wide-area networks","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00337672.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050519S","chronDate":"12-16 Jun 1994","isNumber":"7926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"955","citationCount":"222","articleId":"337672","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":337674,"authors":[{"name":"D.P.

For variable bit rate (VBR) coded video, statistical source models are needed to design networks that achieve acceptable picture quality at minimum cost, and to design traffic shaping and control mechanisms. For video teleconference traffic, the authors have previously shown that traffic is sufficiently accurately characterized by a multi-state Markov chain model that can be derived from three traffic parameters (mean, correlation, and variance). In the present paper, they describe modeling results for sequences with frequent scene changes (the previously studied video teleconferences have very little scene variation) such as entertainment television, news, and sports broadcasts. They analyze eleven long sequences of broadcast video traffic data. Unlike video teleconferences, the different sequences studied have different details regarding distributions of cells per frame. The authors present source models applicable to the different sequences and evaluate their accuracy as predictors of cell losses in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1994.337674","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '94 Conference on Computer Communications","startPage":"664","endPage":"671 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1994.337674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7926","pdfPath":"/iel2/955/7926/00337674.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '94 Conference on Computer Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Traffic control","Communication system traffic control","Multimedia communication","Teleconferencing","Layout","TV broadcasting","Asynchronous transfer mode","Bit rate","Costs","Shape control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous transfer mode","television networks","telecommunication traffic","image sequences","image coding","video signals","television broadcasting","packet switching","encoding","broadband networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VBR broadcast-video traffic","video services","broadband integrated networks","variable bit rate coded video","scene changes","entertainment television","news","sports","broadcast video traffic","cells per frame","source models","cell losses","asynchronous transfer mode networks","ATM networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Source models for VBR broadcast-video traffic","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/337674/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4720938","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"12-16 June 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Jun 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Source models for VBR broadcast-video traffic","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00337674.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037149S","chronDate":"12-16 Jun 1994","isNumber":"7926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"955","citationCount":"15","articleId":"337674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":337677,"authors":[{"name":"S.J.

The author proves that the scheme possesses the desired fairness property and is nearly optimal, in the sense that the maximum permissible disparity among the normalized services offered to the backlogged sessions is never more than two times the corresponding figure in any packet-based queueing system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1994.337677","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '94 Conference on Computer Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '94 Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/955/7926/00337677.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1994.337677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7926","startPage":"636","endPage":"646 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A self-clocked fair queueing scheme for broadband applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=337677","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A self-clocked fair queueing scheme for broadband applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/337677/","conferenceDate":"12-16 June 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4720935","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A self-clocked fair queueing scheme for broadband applications","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00337677.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028021S","chronDate":"12-16 Jun 1994","isNumber":"7926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"955","citationCount":"609","articleId":"337677","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":337684,"authors":[{"name":"U.

The wireline network tracks the current location of the user, and can therefore route messages to a user regardless of the user's location. In addition to its impact on signaling within the wireline network, mobility tracking requires the expenditure of wireless resources as well, including the power consumption of the portable units carried by the users and the radio bandwidth used for registration and paging. Ideally, the mobility tracking scheme used for each user should depend on the user's call and mobility pattern, so that the current registration area approach (which ignores such information) may be wasteful of wireless resources under certain circumstances. In the paper, the authors provide a model and an optimization algorithm based on dynamic programming for choosing the mobility tracking scheme on a per-user basis. While illustrative results are provided for a simple one-dimensional mobility model, the approach is shown to be applicable to a very general class of problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1994.337684","startPage":"577","endPage":"584 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '94 Conference on Computer Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1994.337684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7926","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '94 Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/955/7926/00337684.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of wireless resources for personal communications mobility tracking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/337684/","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of wireless resources for personal communications mobility tracking","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4720928","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-16 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Jun 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of wireless resources for personal communications mobility tracking","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00337684.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.151854S","chronDate":"12-16 Jun 1994","isNumber":"7926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"955","citationCount":"20","articleId":"337684","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":337689,"authors":[{"name":"Zhensheng Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Zhensheng Zhang","id":"37350459900"},{"name":"A.

Such a physical medium permits the limited number of wavelengths to be re-used among the various fiber links, thereby offering very high aggregate capacity. Although the optical connectivity among the access station can be altered by changing the states of the various optical switches, the resulting optical connectivity pattern is constrained by the limitation imposed at the physical level. They also present and study two admission control schemes, used to admit or reject requests for virtual connections. The heuristic is tested on a realistic traffic model, and the call blocking performance of new requests for virtual connections is studied through extensive simulations and compared against the blocking performance of an ideal infinite capacity centralized switch (lowest possible call blocking caused exclusively by congestion on the finite capacity user input/output links, never by the switch fabric itself). Surprisingly, they find that, for a wide range of parameters, the blocking performance of the lightwave network is almost the same as that of the ideal centralized switch. From these results, they conclude that the heuristic algorithm is effective and the admission control scheme is efficient.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1994.337689","startPage":"534","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '94 Conference on Computer Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '94 Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/955/7926/00337689.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1994.337689","endPage":"543 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7926","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A heuristic wavelength assignment algorithm for multihop WDM networks with wavelength routing and wavelength reuse","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/337689/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"A heuristic wavelength assignment algorithm for multihop WDM networks with wavelength routing and wavelength reuse","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4720923","conferenceDate":"12-16 June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A heuristic wavelength assignment algorithm for multihop WDM networks with wavelength routing and wavelength reuse","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00337689.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067854S","chronDate":"12-16 Jun 1994","isNumber":"7926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"955","citationCount":"23","articleId":"337689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":337764,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Our default policy is an environment containing name spaces for naming system-supplied objects, for a user's objects, for objects shared across applications, and for objects private to a process. Some name spaces are private, while others are shared. Any name space can be configured by attaching arbitrary name spaces from different parts of the distributed environment. We also use ordered merge constructions for further flexibility in tailoring name spaces. Each executing process is given a private name space to which other name spaces, such as the user's name space, system-supplied name spaces, and other shared name spaces are attached. Our scheme gives great flexibility in sharing objects and name spaces in a distributed computing environment. Name spaces can be configured dynamically to take advantage of local resources during distributed execution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SDNE.1994.337764","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on Services for Distributed and Networked Environments","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on Services for Distributed and Networked Environments","pdfPath":"/iel2/979/7927/00337764.pdf","startPage":"164","endPage":"171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SDNE.1994.337764","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Naming policies in the Spring system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/337764/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 June 1994","displayDocTitle":"Naming policies in the Spring system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4740674","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-28 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Naming policies in the Spring system","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"00337764.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058095S","chronDate":"27-28 June 1994","isNumber":"7927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"979","citationCount":"1","articleId":"337764","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":338070,"authors":[{"name":"H.A.

Several groups have considered the requirements for such a data set, and a consensus assessment is that many critical studies would be enabled by the availability of a digital global topographic model with accuracies of 2 and 30 m in the vertical and horizontal directions, respectively. Radar interferometric techniques have been used to produce digital elevation models at these accuracies and are technologically feasible as the centerpiece of a spaceborne satellite mission designed to map the world's land masses, which we denote TOPSAT. A radar interferometer is formed by combining the radar echoes received at a pair of antennas displaced across-track, and specialized data processing results in the elevation data. Two alternative implementations, one using a 2 cm-/spl lambda/ radar, and one using a 24 cm-/spl lambda/ radar, are technologically feasible. The former requires an interferometer baseline length of about 15 m to achieve the required accuracy, and this could be built on a single spacecraft with a long extendible boom. The latter necessitates a kilometers long baseline, and would thus be best implemented using two spacecraft flying in formation. Measurement errors are dominated by phase noise, due largely to signal-to-noise ratio considerations, and attitude errors in determining the baseline orientation. For the 2-m accuracy required by TOPSAT, the orientation must be known to 1 arc-second. For the single-spacecraft approach, where attitude would be determined by star tracking systems, this performance is just beyond the several arc-second range of existing instruments. For the dual-spacecraft systems, though, differential global positioning satellite measurements possess sufficient accuracy. Studies indicate that similar performance can be realized with either system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.338070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7932","startPage":"1774","endPage":"1786","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/7932/00338070.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mapping the world's topography using radar interferometry: the TOPSAT mission","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/338070/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1994","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Mapping the world's topography using radar interferometry: the TOPSAT mission","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4856512","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"82","issue":"12","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mapping the world's topography using radar interferometry: the TOPSAT mission","sourcePdf":"00338070.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059759S","chronDate":"Dec.  1994","isNumber":"7932","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"63","articleId":"338070","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":338072,"authors":[{"name":"L.P.

The basic concepts involved in GPR are introduced briefly including the antennas, propagation, target scattering, and mapping. Target identification is important when using GPR since the scatterer can only be observed by evacuation. This is discussed in terms of mapping and complex natural resonances. GPR has been used and is being considered as a tool for the detection of a wide variety of subterranean features. A very brief description of the various applications of GPR is presented. In terms of environmental sensing, it has been applied to detect buried tanks, landfill debris, water levels, and contaminated fluids. The detection of various military devices also represent a serious environmental concern including landmines and unexploded ordnance. There are also possible applications involving the detection of buried utilities highway voids, grave sites. It has been used for examining archeological sites.

One device is driven by an axis-encircling electron beam from a cusp gun and the other employs a magnetron injection gun (MIG). These devices are predicted by a self-consistent nonlinear numerical simulation code to yield, respectively, output powers of 775 kW and 937 kW with 15.5% and 18.7% efficiency, saturated gains of 27 dB and 30 dB, and saturated bandwidths of % and 6.5%. The stability of the amplifiers is ensured by limiting the length of the interaction section(s) to the shortest starting oscillation length as determined by linear theory. The cylindrical waveguide circuits of both amplifiers have been sliced to suppress modes without a threefold azimuthal symmetry. The amplifier utilizing a MIG yields superior performance because the dominant competing interaction is minimized for the choice of the beam's guiding center radius. The advantages as well as limitations of this approach for high power microwave generation are also addressed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/27.338274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/27.338274","startPage":"608","endPage":"615","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/27/7935/00338274.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7935","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stable 1 MW, third-harmonic gyro-TWT amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Stable 1 MW, third-harmonic gyro-TWT amplifier","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"22","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4836991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/338274/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stable 1 MW, third-harmonic gyro-TWT amplifier","sourcePdf":"00338274.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055259S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"11","articleId":"338274","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":338276,"authors":[{"name":"S.A.

The shift of the beam center of charge follows the space bunching into \"spokes\" caused by the RF-induced drift. A nonlinear estimate for the gain is derived and applied to the linear format crossed-field amplifier fed by a continuous sheet beam. The adiabatic approximation for the guiding center trajectories in the low gain regime determines the fraction of trapped/streaming particles and the energy exchange for each group. The radiation gain equals the change in the electron potential energy resulting from the shift in the beam center of charge across the anode-cathode voltage. The drift kinetic energy is approximately conserved, opposed to other microwave devices converting kinetic energy into radiation. The theory accounts for the symmetry of the response curve relative to the frequency detuning /spl omega/-/spl omega//sub 0/, and the flat top near resonance. The analytic predictions agree with the experimental measurements of the gain versus frequency response.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/27.338276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/27.338276","startPage":"626","endPage":"637","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/27/7935/00338276.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7935","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear gain computation for the sheet beam crossed-field amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear gain computation for the sheet beam crossed-field amplifier","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"22","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4836993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/338276/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear gain computation for the sheet beam crossed-field amplifier","sourcePdf":"00338276.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032821S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"13","articleId":"338276","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":338284,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The peak RF power generated by the RKA is limited by electron held emission in the RF converter. In the present L-band geometry, electron emission was detected at power levels above /spl sim/6 GW. Beam loading effects, which also affect power output, may be controlled by spatial and velocity inhomogeneities in the current of the electron beam driving the RKA.

The neural networks simultaneously perform dimensionality reduction with the AMLP and categorization with the SOFM to compress image data. Two hybrid neural networks forming parallel and serial architectures are examined through theoretical analysis and computer simulation. The parallel structure network reduces the dimensionality of input pattern vectors by mapping them to different hidden layers of the AMLP selected by winner-take-all units of the SOFM. The serial structure network categorizes the input pattern vectors into several classes representing prototype vectors. Both the serial and parallel structures are combinations of the AMLP and SOFM networks. These hybrid neural networks achieve clear performance improvement with respect to decoded picture quality and compression ratios, compared to existing image compression techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/338325/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4867021","volume":"40","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Image compression using hybrid neural networks combining the auto-associative multi-layer perceptron and the self-organizing feature map","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image compression using hybrid neural networks combining the auto-associative multi-layer perceptron and the self-organizing feature map","sourcePdf":"00338325.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061913S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"7","articleId":"338325","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":338339,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The validity of the new method is verified using a trial model. This method realizes system software for performing processes like startup, control and display using the object-oriented concept. A control object is transmitted from an AV terminal device to another AV terminal device when they are connected. For startup or control, the first AV terminal does not use a control code as was done in the conventional control of AV terminals. Instead it transmits a message object corresponding to a control object which has been transmitted in advance. The advantages of using this method include the following: (1) it is possible to absorb the differences between devices, for instance the difference in control codes; (2) users need have no knowledge about the device drivers; and (3) the memory capacity required to control the AV controllers can be minimized. Furthermore, if the AV terminal's control microcomputer has an RPC (remote procedure call) function, it is possible to control the AV terminals in a distributed network environment. This can be done by sending a procedure call to the AV terminal device in the form of a message to startup the object in the AV terminal device.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/338339/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4867035","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"40","issue":"4","displayDocTitle":"A new audio-visual control using message object transmission","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new audio-visual control using message object transmission","sourcePdf":"00338339.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068122S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"5","articleId":"338339","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":338362,"authors":[{"name":"R.

A simple method that works for both narrow-band and broad-band arrays is presented. This method is based on the normalized leaky LMS algorithm in conjunction with a generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) structure, where the GSC is designed using a spatial filtering approach. In essence, the suppression of the spatial filters and the implicit noise of the leaky LMS algorithm together determine the adaptive beamformer. Analytical expressions are given for the Wiener filters and the output spectrum versus frequency and point source location. These expressions are employed in the design specification of the spatial filters and to obtain conditions for a controlled quiescent beamformer response.

The signal can be formed either in the time domain or in the frequency domain. The frequency domain approach gives an output power spectrum precisely identical to a preferred shape. Therefore, the sidelobe levels after matched filtering are not raised by unwanted spectral magnitude ripples which exist when a time domain method is adopted. The absence of spectral ripples is desirable for applications requiring long range transmission and good multipath discrimination capability. An acceptable tradeoff between time resolution and sidelobe levels is achieved by properly choosing the desired power spectral shape. As the time resolution is usually the most critical specification for precision travel-time measurements, it is shown that by sacrificing some of the transducer's output power capability, a waveform with a considerably wider bandwidth can be transmitted, resulting in a significantly enhanced time resolution. A quasi-steady-state (QSS) approximation is used in the signal design, leading to a manageable and intuitive design procedure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7938","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/48.338397","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/48/7938/00338397.pdf","startPage":"611","endPage":"618","doi":"10.1109/48.338397","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of periodic signals using FM sweeps and amplitude modulation for ocean acoustic travel-time measurements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Design of periodic signals using FM sweeps and amplitude modulation for ocean acoustic travel-time measurements","volume":"19","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4854636","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/338397/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of periodic signals using FM sweeps and amplitude modulation for ocean acoustic travel-time measurements","sourcePdf":"00338397.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034945S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"7","articleId":"338397","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":338400,"authors":[{"name":"Y.W.

By applying the technique of adaptive modeling, a short FIR filter can be designed to carry out any required narrowband constant phase shift. A 4-tap FIR filter designed in this way can generate constant phase shift within bandwidths of 0.04 (relative to the sampling frequency), with an error of less than 1/spl deg/. Thus a beam can be formed with a bank of short FIR filters, each filter corresponding to one sensor. Due to the light computational load of this method, it is rather convenient for digital signal processors (DSP) to implement beamforming in real time. Satisfactory sonar beam patterns are shown to result from a TMS320C25-based emulation of the architecture.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/48.338400","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/48/7938/00338400.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7938","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/48.338400","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","startPage":"635","endPage":"638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient architecture for real-time narrowband beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=338400","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"An efficient architecture for real-time narrowband beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/338400/","volume":"19","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4854639","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient architecture for real-time narrowband beamforming","sourcePdf":"00338400.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085305S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"3","articleId":"338400","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":338415,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

As the channel width is reduced, the magnitude of the threshold voltage first decreases before the onset of the expected sharp rise in Vt for widths narrower than 0.4 \u03bcm. Modeling shows that a \"boron puddle\" is created near the trench bounded edge as a result of transient enhanced diffusion (TED) during the gate oxidation step. TED is governed by interstitials produced by a deep phosphorus implant, used for latchup suppression, diffusing towards the trench sidewall and top surface of the device.

Many hardware and software implementations are based on these algorithms. One class of fast algorithms for computing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is based on a recursive factorization of the polynomial 1-z/sup N/. This paper introduces a simple recursive factorization of 1-z/sup N/ over the real numbers and a mathematical framework that generalizes the form of the DFT. Using the recursive factorization, efficient algorithms are derived to compute the DFT and the cyclic convolution of sequences of length with a power of two. Real-valued DIT and real-valued DIF algorithms are developed so that the accumulated FFT technologies can be fully utilized for real sequences. Introducing a real-valued butterfly, the algorithmic structures of the DIT and the DIF algorithms are shown to be equally applicable for the real-valued algorithms by systematic modifications.

The approach used is an adaptive feedback linearizing control to enhance the robustness to unknown or varying interconnection parameters like equivalent reactances of the transmission lines. Control design based on external feedback linearization may not be robust to handle varying power-system configurations. Inexact cancellation of terms due to uncertainties may result in performance deterioration like inter-system oscillations. Adaptation in estimated parameters is utilized to achieve an asymptotically exact cancellation of terms. It is shown that the adaptive control results in bounded states and maintains the desired performance. The control scheme developed is applied to a power system with two generators and an infinite bus connected through a network of transformers and transmission lines. Simulation studies for unknown interconnections arising due to faults and subsequent line switchings in the transmission network are carried out. The performance using the nonadaptive feedback linearizing control is shown to degrade for network configuration variations arising due to transmission line faults. The response obtained using the proposed scheme is compared with that using a conventional IEEE Type I excitation control. The studies validate the fact that connective stability and robust performance is maintained for unknown interconnection topology using the adaptive feedback linearizing scheme.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/338663/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4857119","volume":"2","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive nonlinear excitation control of power systems with unknown interconnections","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive nonlinear excitation control of power systems with unknown interconnections","sourcePdf":"00338663.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041386S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"67","articleId":"338663","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":338666,"authors":[{"name":"J.F.

Equations defining a critical capacitance governing SSN are included. Output buffers normally drive receivers through bond wires, signal traces, pins, and the board traces. For the short trace, the output is modeled as a lumped inductance and for the long trace, as a transmission line. Such a condition at the output will alter the current that defines the noise. Equations are presented for the critical inductance and the transmission line characteristic impedance. Above these critical values, these parameters will tend to decrease the noise generated.

That is, the line can be represented in the form of a frequency-domain model or a table of measured frequency-domain data. Our approach initially uses a forced stable decade-by-decade l/sub 2/ minimization approach to construct a sum of rational functions approximation, but the approximation has dozens of poles and zeros. This unnecessarily high-order model is then reduced using a guaranteed stable model order reduction scheme based on balanced realizations. Once the reduced-order model is derived, it can be combined with the transmission line's inherent delay to generate an impulse response. Finally, following what is now a standard approach, the impulse response can be efficiently incorporated in a circuit simulator using recursive convolution.

It is found that ground plane geometry significantly affects the degree of crosstalk noise between two adjacent signal lines and the characteristic impedance of a transmission line. A signal conductor over a meshed ground plane exhibits less degradation in rise time and voltage amplitude, compared to a line over a solid ground plane, due to the lower line capacitance and lower conductor loss. However, the longer current path in the case of a meshed ground plane increases the overall line inductance which results in a slower propagation velocity. A ground plane with optimum geometric configuration, in mesh pitch and aperture, is chosen that meets system level performance requirements while still being compatible with processing constraints. The impact of transmission lines with meshed ground plane on multichip module design for digital applications is also discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7951","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part B","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part B","pdfPath":"/iel4/96/7951/00338726.pdf","doi":"10.1109/96.338726","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/96.338726","startPage":"578","endPage":"583","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The signal transmission characteristics of embedded microstrip transmission lines over a meshed ground plane in copper/polyimide multichip module","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/338726/","displayDocTitle":"The signal transmission characteristics of embedded microstrip transmission lines over a meshed ground plane in copper/polyimide multichip module","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4853360","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The signal transmission characteristics of embedded microstrip transmission lines over a meshed ground plane in copper/polyimide multichip module","sourcePdf":"00338726.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050883S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7951","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"96","citationCount":"10","articleId":"338726","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":338733,"authors":[{"name":"V.

It is also difficult to predict because of complex time temperature dependence of solder behavior. Strain based solder fatigue descriptions, like Coffin-Manson, are not adequate as the fatigue life of the solder may also be function of stresses. When the relationship between stress and strain is not unique, which is the case here because of strain rate dependence, a Coffin-Manson type of strain based correlation will be valid only over a limited range. A nonlinear finite element method (FEM) based simulation methodology, has been developed, for predicting the life of solder joints when subjected to thermal cycling. This methodology uses a hysteresis energy based damage function approach for damage and fatigue life prediction of the solder joint. The nonlinear solder behavior response inclusive of elastic, time independent plastic and time dependent viscoplastic response is accounted for. The methodology has been used for correlating the fatigue life of flip chip package designs with silicon die, alumina substrate and 95Pb5%Sn peripheral bumps subjected to thermal cycling. Two different bump designs and six temperature cycles with different ramp and dwell times were used from the literature to correlate the life prediction methodology with experimentally determined mean cycles to failure. A multiple cycle response was simulated to determine the stable cycle response. The observed correlation between the hysteresis energy based damage function and experimentally determined fatigue life is extremely encouraging.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7951","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part B","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part B","pdfPath":"/iel4/96/7951/00338733.pdf","doi":"10.1109/96.338733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/96.338733","startPage":"626","endPage":"631","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy based methodology for damage and life prediction of solder joints under thermal cycling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/338733/","displayDocTitle":"Energy based methodology for damage and life prediction of solder joints under thermal cycling","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4859746","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy based methodology for damage and life prediction of solder joints under thermal cycling","sourcePdf":"00338733.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030309S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7951","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"96","citationCount":"32","articleId":"338733","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":338746,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The proposed method needs neither dynamic models of the system nor control experts for the control problem. Multi-layered perceptron neural networks are used to form the neural network based quasi-fuzzy logic controller (QFLC). The control performance of the QFLC is achieved on-line using the feedback error learning scheme. The fuzzy control rules are then extracted from the input-output characteristics of the QFLC. They are reduced to form the fuzzy control rule base for an FLC through consecutive procedures such as smoothing, logical reduction, and test running and selection of firing rules. To verify the validity of the proposed rule base derivation method, the authors apply the method to fuzzy logic control of an inverted pendulum.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Nov 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/339038/","accessionNumber":"4794461","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"15-19 Nov. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy rule base derivation using neural network-based fuzzy logic controller by self-learning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy rule base derivation using neural network-based fuzzy logic controller by self-learning","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00339038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034905S","chronDate":"15-19 Nov 1993","isNumber":"7958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1044","citationCount":"8","articleId":"339038","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":339043,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This paper outlines a methodology for the design of an intelligent controller to perform optimal control of a nonlinear system adaptively, using emerging technologies of fuzzy logic (FL) and artificial neural networks (ANN). FL is utilized to incorporate the available knowledge into the control system, and ANN technology is applied to adaptively provide an optimal control strategy based on some performance criteria. The technique is tested on a system that consists of a DC motor (a linear time-invariant (LTI) system) and a thermal system (a time-varying nonlinear system).

For a restricted class of systems, necessary conditions for teaching the feedback linearizing function to a multilayer neural network, trained by the generalized delta rule, are presented. In the proposed scheme, two neural networks are trained in three different stages. In the first stage, the nonlinear system is excited several times to teach the system inverse dynamics to a neural network. In the second stage, the system is again excited several times to train a second neural network with an estimation of the feedback linearizing function of the nonlinear system. After the two stages of training, the system is operated with the second neural network as feedback, its weights are adaptively adjusted to accommodate possible parameter variations in the nonlinear system. Some preliminary results are presented, showing the feedback linearization of a DC motor with a nonlinear load.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1993.339084","startPage":"182","endPage":"187 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IECON '93 - 19th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1993.339084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7958","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IECON '93 - 19th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel2/1044/7958/00339084.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedback linearization of unknown nonlinear systems using neural networks-an application to motor control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/339084/","displayDocTitle":"Feedback linearization of unknown nonlinear systems using neural networks-an application to motor control","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4794415","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"15-19 Nov. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Nov 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback linearization of unknown nonlinear systems using neural networks-an application to motor control","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00339084.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045821S","chronDate":"15-19 Nov 1993","isNumber":"7958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1044","citationCount":"2","articleId":"339084","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":339095,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The voltage-controlled PWM inverter (VCPI) unit as a master is developed to keep a constant sinusoidal wave output voltage. The current-controlled PWM inverter (CCPI) units as a slave are controlled to track the distributive current. The power distribution center performs the function of distributing the output current of each active unit. In this proposed scheme of parallel operation, each of the units can be designed nearly independently, and the CCPI units do not need a PLL circuit for synchronization. As a result, the parallel operation of the UPS is easy to implement and to expand system capacity. For the purpose of illustration, the system, including three single-phase units which are operated in parallel, is analyzed and experimentally verified.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1993.339119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7958","startPage":"1111","endPage":"1116 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IECON '93 - 19th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel2/1044/7958/00339119.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combination voltage-controlled and current-controlled PWM inverters for parallel operation of UPS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/339119/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"Combination voltage-controlled and current-controlled PWM inverters for parallel operation of UPS","conferenceDate":"15-19 Nov. 1993","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4785141","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combination voltage-controlled and current-controlled PWM inverters for parallel operation of UPS","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00339119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043459S","chronDate":"15-19 Nov 1993","isNumber":"7958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1044","articleId":"339119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":339121,"authors":[{"name":"S.D.

An adaptive estimator is used to remove the twice line frequency ripple component from the measured output voltage. As the output voltage feedback loop no longer contains a ripple component the sub line-frequency low pass filter found in traditional designs is dispensed with. Time constants in the voltage feedback loop are improved by an order of magnitude giving a similar reduction in output voltage overshoots. The controller copes with considerable uncertainty in input voltage magnitude, line frequency and output capacitance. All sections of the control system are shown to be asymptotically stable and suitable bounds are placed on feedback loop cross-over frequencies. Simulation results are presented to verify the excellent dynamics and robust behaviour of the design. It is concluded that the superior performance over traditional designs warrants the small increase in controller complexity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1993.339133","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IECON '93 - 19th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IECON '93 - 19th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel2/1044/7958/00339133.pdf","startPage":"1027","endPage":"1032 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1993.339133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast controller design for practical power-factor correction systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=339133","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Nov 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/339133/","displayDocTitle":"Fast controller design for practical power-factor correction systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4785127","conferenceDate":"15-19 Nov. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast controller design for practical power-factor correction systems","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00339133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034715S","chronDate":"15-19 Nov 1993","isNumber":"7958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1044","citationCount":"23","articleId":"339133","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":339146,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Most of these programs, however, do not include detailed models of the components of the drive system (e.g. battery, drive motor, inverter, etc.) which is very important for proper sizing and matching of these components to meet all the vehicle specifications during normal and emergency operating conditions. A new model used for simulation of the electric drive systems is described and in this paper. The simulation program is used to simulate certain fault conditions which are useful for electric vehicle as well as industrial drive applications. This versatile model has the features of studying normal and possible component fault conditions to determine the limp-home capability of an electric vehicle or reliably predicting the stator current wave forms in case of a broken rotor cage bar or end ring of large industrial drives. Transient performance could also he studied and different battery models, drive motor control strategies and various types of power devices could be checked at the design stage. Parametric studies could also be performed using the simulation program to study the impact of varying the parameters of the components on the system performance. Many simulation results of this program have been given for the electric vehicle. In this paper simulation results of faults in an industrial 45 KW drive motor fed from the 60 Hz mains and 220 Hz are compared to those created when the motor is fed from an inverter under the same conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1993.339164","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IECON '93 - 19th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","startPage":"1146","endPage":"1150 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1993.339164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7958","pdfPath":"/iel2/1044/7958/00339164.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IECON '93 - 19th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electric vehicles","Inverters","Battery powered vehicles","Vehicle driving","Predictive models","Stators","Rotors","Power system modeling","Motor drives","Parametric study"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicles","electric propulsion","electric drives","failure analysis","electric machine analysis computing","digital simulation","stators","rotors","squirrel cage motors","machine theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault conditions simulation","electric drive","electric vehicle","industrial drive","emergency operating conditions","limp-home capability","stator current wave forms prediction","broken rotor cage bar","broken end ring","battery models","drive motor control strategies","transient performance","power devices","parametric studies","inverter","45 kW","60 Hz","220 Hz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"System simulation of fault conditions in the components of the electric drive system of an electric vehicle or an industrial drive","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/339164/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4818036","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"15-19 Nov. 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Nov 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System simulation of fault conditions in the components of the electric drive system of an electric vehicle or an industrial drive","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00339164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024569S","chronDate":"15-19 Nov 1993","isNumber":"7958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1044","citationCount":"7","articleId":"339164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":339168,"authors":[{"name":"G.C.D.

The paper describes the fuzzy logic-based online efficient optimal control of a drive that uses an indirect vector controlled induction motor speed control system in the inner loop. At steady-state light load operation, a fuzzy controller adaptively reduces the excitation current on the basis of measured input power such that, for a given load torque and speed, the drive settles down to the minimum input power; i.e., operates at maximum efficiency. The low frequency pulsating torque due to reduction of rotor flux is compensated in a feedforward manner. If the load torque or speed command changes, the efficiency search algorithm is abandoned and the rated flux is established to obtain the best transient response. The drive system, with the proposed efficiency optimization controller, is simulated with lossy models of power converter and machine, and its performance is thoroughly investigated. An experimental drive system with the proposed controller implemented on a TMS320C25 digital signal processor, is also tested in laboratory to validate the theoretical development.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1993.339168","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IECON '93 - 19th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IECON '93 - 19th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel2/1044/7958/00339168.pdf","startPage":"1168","endPage":"1174 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1993.339168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy logic based on-line efficiency optimization control of an indirect vector controlled induction motor drive","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=339168","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Nov 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/339168/","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy logic based on-line efficiency optimization control of an indirect vector controlled induction motor drive","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4818040","conferenceDate":"15-19 Nov. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy logic based on-line efficiency optimization control of an indirect vector controlled induction motor drive","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00339168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033092S","chronDate":"15-19 Nov 1993","isNumber":"7958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1044","citationCount":"34","articleId":"339168","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":339235,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The inverter is nonlinear which causes instability problems in some specific working points of the AC machine and it emits acoustical noise due to the switching frequency. Nonlinearities like dead-time in the power devices, a load dependent DC link voltage ripple and the voltage drop across the switches are modelled and compensated by improved modulation techniques in order to obtain an ideal inverter. Different feedback and feedforward techniques are proposed. The acoustic noise is reduced by using a random modulation strategy. Measurements show a significant improvement by using feedforward and feedback techniques for linearizing the inverter as well as an improvement in reduction of the acoustic noise emission is achieved by using random modulation.

With forced-commutated switches, the voltage source inverter approach is superior to the conventional current source approach, in terms of number of components and control options. However, the straight-forward delta control of the rectifier is characterized by a slow response and potential stability problems. This paper proposes a current-controlled PWM rectifier as an alternative. It provides near sinusoidal input currents with unity power factor and a low output voltage ripple. Moreover, it produces a well-defined input current harmonic spectrum, exhibits fast transient response to load voltage variations and is capable of regenerative operation. PWM pattern generation is based on a carrier technique and the current controller is implemented in the: (a) stationary (abc) frame; and (b) rotating (dqo) frame. The design and the performance of the two controller options are investigated and compared.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation","Rectifiers","Reactive power","Power system harmonics","Switches","Pulse width modulation inverters","Force control","Voltage control","Stability","Low voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power convertors","pulse width modulation","invertors","rectifiers","rectifying circuits","power system harmonics","power factor","commutation","electric current control","transient response","control system synthesis","control system analysis","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM rectifier","rotating frame","stationary frame","input current harmonics","input power factor","forced-commutated switches","voltage source inverter","power factor","current control","sinusoidal input currents","input current harmonic spectrum","transient response","load voltage variations","regenerative operation","pattern generation","carrier technique","abc frame","dqo frame","design","performance","simulation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IECON.1993.339236","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IECON '93 - 19th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IECON '93 - 19th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel2/1044/7958/00339236.pdf","startPage":"1193","endPage":"1198 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7958","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1993.339236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance investigation of a current-controlled voltage-regulated PWM rectifier in rotating and stationary frames","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=339236","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance investigation of a current-controlled voltage-regulated PWM rectifier in rotating and stationary frames","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/339236/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4818044","conferenceDate":"15-19 Nov. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Nov 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance investigation of a current-controlled voltage-regulated PWM rectifier in rotating and stationary frames","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00339236.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026864S","chronDate":"15-19 Nov 1993","isNumber":"7958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1044","citationCount":"26","articleId":"339236","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":339244,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The method uses independent hysteresis comparator controllers to regulate the direct and quadrature axis components of the three phase output voltages. Main problems of NPC inverters such as neutral point potential variations and distortion at low input references are solved by the simple control scheme even when low-speed devices are used. In addition, the control method offers a wider control range and fast response.

In the proposed method, reconstruction of shapes from shading images can be regarded as a kind of optimization problem, that is to search for the shape providing the most similar shading image to the shading image of the original object, and then, the GA is applied to solving the optimization problem. Each candidate of the shape corresponds to an individual in the population. The fitness value of each individual is decided from the similarity of the shading image provided by the candidate of the shape to the measured shading image. The individuals with higher fitness values are selected according to mechanisms of natural selection of the GA, and then the 3D shape providing the highest fitness value, which is the reconstructed shape of the object, can be found finally. Using the proposed method, 3-D shapes reconstructed from shading images of synthesized objects which are calculated by computer simulation and those of real objects which are obtained with a CCD camera. The results of the reconstruction demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Nov 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/339315/","accessionNumber":"4818074","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"15-19 Nov. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Shape from shading using genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shape from shading using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00339315.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045344S","chronDate":"15-19 Nov 1993","isNumber":"7958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1044","citationCount":"5","articleId":"339315","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":339332,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The structure of the controller consists of an inverse dynamics model of which the parameters are to be learnt in real time and a feedback servo to guarantee stability. By exploiting the a priori knowledge about the dynamics of the robot, a single layer linear network is obtained to model the inverse dynamics thereby reducing the training time. Real time learning of the synaptic weights which represent the parameters of the inverse dynamics of the robot can be completed in a few minutes. Experimental results demonstrated that the performance of the neurocontroller improved rapidly during learning.

Similarity-based algorithms as well as texture algorithms have been developed and hardware-implemented for defect detection in a high-textured surface where, for the most of defects, segmentation can not be achieved by only means of threshold techniques. The system has been applied to continuous cast aluminum inspection, where up to fifteen different kinds of defects must be detected and classified.

Crowd estimation is based on the image-processing and inference phases applied to the acquired data. Images come from a set of visual b/w camera oriented towards a zone to be monitored. Some significant features extracted from each acquired image are related to the number of people present in the monitored scene using the nonlinear models obtained by means of dynamic programming in an off-line training phase. The present approach, employing previously obtained estimates, improves the accuracy of estimation, with respect to an evaluation based only on present available data, and can predict crowding values without using new data, between two successive acquisitions. Results obtained after an extended test phase in a station of Genova's underground are reported.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1993.339357","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IECON '93 - 19th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IECON '93 - 19th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel2/1044/7958/00339357.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1993.339357","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7958","startPage":"1860","endPage":"1864 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A real-time vision system for crowding monitoring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=339357","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A real-time vision system for crowding monitoring","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Nov 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/339357/","conferenceDate":"15-19 Nov. 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4818117","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A real-time vision system for crowding monitoring","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00339357.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054467S","chronDate":"15-19 Nov 1993","isNumber":"7958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1044","citationCount":"20","articleId":"339357","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":339380,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This paper presents a continuing work with emphasis on the design of quadruple-ridged waveguides. The characteristics of square, circular and diagonal quadruple-ridged waveguides, including cutoff frequencies, attenuation, impedance and modal field distributions, are for the first time systematically analysed and reported. Distinct to being in a single- or double-ridged waveguide, the fundamental-mode in a quadruple-ridged waveguide has a cutoff frequency very close to that of the second-lowest mode, thus the natural single mode bandwidth is very small. However, when the second-lowest mode is effectively suppressed or not excited, a very wide bandwidth (6:1) can be achieved. This unique property, plus the capabilities of dual-polarization, high power, and low impedance, makes the quadruple-ridged waveguides well-suited to many antenna and microwave applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.339743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.339743","startPage":"2201","endPage":"2207","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/7960/00339743.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7960","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and design of quadruple-ridged waveguides","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and design of quadruple-ridged waveguides","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"42","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4860749","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/339743/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and design of quadruple-ridged waveguides","sourcePdf":"00339743.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040526S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"90","articleId":"339743","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":339745,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Prony's method is used to compute the frequency-dependent effective dielectric constant of a microstrip line and the scattering parameters of microstrip circuit elements, which corroborate well with published and measured results. A new method is discussed to reduce the computer memory required to store the temporal samples which are employed in the spectral processing of the FDTD data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of spectral domain Prony's method to the FDTD analysis of planar microstrip circuits","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.339772","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/7960/00339772.pdf","startPage":"2391","endPage":"2398","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.339772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7960","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=339772","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/339772/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"Application of spectral domain Prony's method to the FDTD analysis of planar microstrip circuits","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4871532","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of spectral domain Prony's method to the FDTD analysis of planar microstrip circuits","sourcePdf":"00339772.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049945S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"34","articleId":"339772","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":339785,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.H.

The combiner consists of a grid oscillator which feeds a transmission amplifier at its focal point. The focal-point feed improves power coupling efficiency over that of a plane-wave feed. A linear 7-element lens amplifier array demonstrates 29 dB of isolation and a 30/spl deg/ continuous scan angle with less than 1 dB power variation at 9.7 GHz. A 23-element two-dimensional lens amplifier array fed by a grid oscillator demonstrates 5.7 dB gain and a 30/spl deg/ scan angle with less than 2 dB power variation at 10.25 GHz. When horn-fed, the 24-element lens has an isolation of 17-21 dB over a 3% bandwidth. The grid oscillator, as well as receive and transmit sections of the lens amplifiers, are each fabricated on single substrates, making monolithic millimeter-wave integration of each component possible.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lenses","Power amplifiers","Feeds","Microstrip antenna arrays","Oscillators","Linear antenna arrays","Polarization","Power combiners","Antenna arrays","Patch antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimetre wave devices","MMIC","power combiners","microstrip antenna arrays","field effect MMIC"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-level power combining","lens amplifier","quasi-optical power combiner","grid oscillator","transmission amplifier","focal-point feed","power coupling efficiency","scan angle","power variation","horn feed","monolithic millimeter-wave integration","5.7 dB","9.7 to 10.25 GHz"]}],"doi":"10.1109/22.339785","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/7960/00339785.pdf","startPage":"2480","endPage":"2485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7960","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.339785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-level power combining using a lens amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=339785","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Two-level power combining using a lens amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/339785/","volume":"42","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4877252","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-level power combining using a lens amplifier","sourcePdf":"00339785.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02834S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"32","articleId":"339785","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":339792,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This technique is demonstrated by the optimization of a microstrip structure for which a convenient analytical/empirical model is assumed to be unavailable. For illustration, we focus upon a three-section microstrip impedance transformer and a double folded stub microstrip filter and explore various design characteristics utilizing an electromagnetic (EM) field simulator. We propose two distinct EM models: coarse for fast computations, and the corresponding fine for a few more accurate and well-targeted simulations. The coarse model, useful when circuit-theoretic models are not readily available, permits rapid exploration of different starting points, solution robustness, local minima, parameter sensitivities, yield-driven design and other design characteristics within a practical time frame. The computationally intensive fine model is used to verify the space-mapped designs obtained exploiting the coarse model, as well as in the SM process itself.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space mapping technique for electromagnetic optimization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.339794","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/7960/00339794.pdf","startPage":"2536","endPage":"2544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.339794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7960","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=339794","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/339794/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"Space mapping technique for electromagnetic optimization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4877261","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space mapping technique for electromagnetic optimization","sourcePdf":"00339794.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056818S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"401","articleId":"339794","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":339796,"authors":[{"name":"Hang Jin","affiliation":["Laboratory of Lightwave Electronics, Microwaves, and Communications (LLiMiC), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"lastName":"Hang Jin","id":"37290368800"},{"name":"R.

The emphasis is on values among transmitter bandwidth, receiver bandwidth, carrier spacing, and antenna diversity which provide the best opportunities for interference suppression. Through analyses of the number of degrees of freedom and constraints in generalized zero-forcing equalizers, and partial comparisons to calculations of equalizer minimum-mean-square performance, four results are obtained. First, with one antenna and a linear equalizer, arbitrarily large receiver bandwidths allow for marginal improvements in spectral efficiency through decreased carrier spacing, because the carrier spacing cannot be reduced to a value below the symbol rate without incurring unsuppressible interference. Second, large receiver bandwidths assist multiple antennas in improving the spectral efficiency in that carrier spacing values may go below the symbol rate, even in the presence of cochannel interference. Third, the use of equalizers and linear combiners, together with large receiver bandwidths, allows large transmitter bandwidths to be used. Fourth, for cochannel interference and intersymbol interference, the number of interferers that may be suppressible by a generalized zero-forcing linear equalizer/combiner increases linearly with the product of the number of antennas and the truncated integer ratio of the total bandwidth to the symbol rate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/7961/00339831.pdf","startPage":"3109","endPage":"3118","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.339831","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.339831","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7961","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=339831","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Suppression of adjacent-channel, cochannel, and intersymbol interference by equalizers and linear combiners","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Interchannel interference","Receiving antennas","Transmitters","Decision feedback equalizers","Transmitting antennas","Interference suppression","Performance analysis","Interference constraints","Intersymbol interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intersymbol interference","cochannel interference","adjacent channel interference","decision feedback equalisers","antenna arrays","radio transmitters","radio receivers","diversity reception","interference suppression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["degrees of freedom","adjacent-channel interference","cochannel interference","intersymbol interference","equalizers","linear combiners","decision-feedback equalizer","transmitter bandwidth","receiver bandwidth","carrier spacing","antenna diversity","interference suppression","generalized zero-forcing equalizers","minimum-mean-square performance","spectral efficiency","decreased carrier spacing","symbol rate","multiple antennas","truncated integer ratio","ISI","ACI","CCI"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/339831/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"Suppression of adjacent-channel, cochannel, and intersymbol interference by equalizers and linear combiners","volume":"42","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4871770","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Suppression of adjacent-channel, cochannel, and intersymbol interference by equalizers and linear combiners","sourcePdf":"00339831.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05236S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"70","articleId":"339831","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":339837,"authors":[{"name":"B.D.

The unique feature of the trellis codes considered is that they are constructed over the set of possible signature sequences rather than over some standard 2-D signal constellation. The resulting codes have a small number of signals per dimension. We present several examples of these trellis codes, and suggest possible methods of implementation. We also present a detailed error analysis for this system, which employs techniques developed by Lehnert and Pursley (1987, 1989)) to accurately model the multiple access interference. We generate numerical results for several examples and conclude that the proposed trellis coded systems yield significant performance improvements over binary antipodal DS/SSMA systems. In addition, the new trellis codes perform better than standard error control techniques with the same complexity and code rate.

The conventional matched filter receiver suffers from the near-far problem, and requires strict power control (typically involving feedback from receiver to transmitter) for acceptable performance. Multiuser detection schemes previously proposed mitigate the near-far problem, but are complex and require explicit knowledge or estimates of the interference parameters. In this paper, we present and analyze several new MMSE interference suppression schemes, which have the advantage of being near-far resistant (to varying degrees, depending on their complexity), and can be implemented adaptively when interference parameters are unknown and/or time-varying, Numerical results are provided that show that these schemes offer significant performance gains relative to the matched filter receiver. We conclude that MMSE detectors can alleviate the need for stringent power control.

Sufficient conditions are given such that the signal samples represent sufficient statistics. These conditions involve signal bandwidth, sampling/symbol rate and the analog prefilter characteristics. It is shown that the sampling rate need not be an exact multiple of the symbol rate, i.e., the samples can be taken from a free-running oscillator. All subsequent signal processing operations in the receiver then operate with the clock of this free-running oscillator. Timing recovery is then performed by a time-variant linear digital interpolator and a decimator. Carrier recovery and sequence estimation are performed at an average rate of one symbol per sample.

The model determines the amount of signal degradation caused by any noise environment that can be modeled as a Markov chain. The specific example of a Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) noise environment is discussed in detail. The model uses importance sampling to determine low bit error rates (BERs) for a wide range of noise environments. It is faster than a conventional simulation because the required run time is independent of the BER. It is more flexible than existing analytic models, as these make major assumptions, such as that symbol errors are independent (interleaving), or that all bursts have infinite power. The model increases the simulation efficiency by biasing the channel statistics so that more codeword errors occur and adjusts for this by using a weighting function whose value is calculated through the use of a Markov chain. The results show that using interleaving results in a significant performance improvement when the lengths of the interfering bursts are long relative to the data symbol length.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/339845/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4871784","volume":"42","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An importance sampling analysis of a noninterleaved Viterbi decoder in an RFI environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An importance sampling analysis of a noninterleaved Viterbi decoder in an RFI environment","sourcePdf":"00339845.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030451S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"1","articleId":"339845","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":339877,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.

It is worth emphasizing that the use of one of these techniques, slow random FH, results in a system that is in effect a hybrid of TDMA and code division multiple access (CDMA).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/35/7962/00339881.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"57","doi":"10.1109/35.339881","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.339881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time division multiple access methods for wireless personal communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/339881/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Time division multiple access methods for wireless personal communications","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4871865","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time division multiple access methods for wireless personal communications","sourcePdf":"00339881.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041465S","chronDate":"Jan.  1995","isNumber":"7962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"98","articleId":"339881","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":339882,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In conventional stage-by-stage design procedure, each stage codebook is optimized for that particular stage distortion and does not consider the distortion from the subsequent stages. However, the overall performance can be improved if each stage codebook is optimized by minimizing the distortion from the subsequent stage quantizers as well as the distortion from the previous stage quantizers. This can only be achieved when stage codebooks are jointly designed for each other. In this paper, the proposed codebook design procedure is based on a multilayer competitive neural network where each layer of this network represents one stage of the RVQ. The weight connecting these layers form the corresponding stage codebooks of the RVQ. The joint design problem of the RVQ's codebooks (weights of the multilayer competitive neural network) is formulated as a nonlinearly constrained optimization task which is based on a Lagrangian error function. This Lagrangian error function includes all the constraints that are imposed by the joint optimization of the codebooks. The proposed procedure seeks a locally optimal solution by iteratively solving the equations for this Lagrangian error function. Simulation results show an improvement in the performance of an RVQ when designed using the proposed joint optimization technique as compared to the stage-by-stage design, where both generalized Lloyd algorithm (GLA) and the Kohonen learning algorithm (KLA) were used to design each stage codebook independently, as well as the conventional joint-optimization technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.339912","startPage":"1452","endPage":"1459","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7963/00339912.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.339912","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Residual vector quantization using a multilayer competitive neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vector quantization","Nonhomogeneous media","Design optimization","Multi-layer neural network","Lagrangian functions","Algorithm design and analysis","Neural networks","Constraint optimization","Iterative algorithms","Joining processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vector quantisation","multilayer perceptrons","feedforward neural nets","image coding","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["residual vector quantization","multilayer competitive neural network","stage distortion","nonlinearly constrained optimization","stage codebooks","Lagrangian error function","locally optimal solution","simulation results","generalized Lloyd algorithm","Kohonen learning algorithm","joint-optimization technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/339912/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"Residual vector quantization using a multilayer competitive neural network","volume":"12","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4860430","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Residual vector quantization using a multilayer competitive neural network","sourcePdf":"00339912.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044589S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"11","articleId":"339912","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":339913,"authors":[{"name":"U.

In this scenario, the noise is characterized as being the sum of the interfering users' signals and additive Gaussian noise. The optimal receiver for DS/SSMA systems has a complexity that is exponential in the number of users. This prohibitive complexity has spawned the area of research on suboptimal receivers with moderate complexity. Adaptive algorithms for detection allow for reception when the communication environment is either unknown or changing. Motivated by previous work with radial basis functions (RBF's) for performing equalization, RBF networks that operate with knowledge of only a subset of the system parameters are studied. Although this form of detection has been previously studied (group detection) when the system parameters are known, in this work, neural network techniques are employed to adaptively determine unknown system parameters. This approach is further bolstered by the fact that the optimal detector in the synchronous case can be implemented by a RBF network when all of the system parameters are known. The RBF network's performance (with estimated parameters) is compared with the optimal synchronous detector, the decorrelating detector and the single layer perceptron detector. Clustering techniques and adaptive least mean squares methods are investigated to determine the unknown system parameters. This work shows that the adaptive radial basis function network attains near optimal performance and is robust in realistic communication environments.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7963/00339913.pdf","startPage":"1460","endPage":"1470","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.339913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.339913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7963","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=339913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network techniques for adaptive multiuser demodulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Adaptive systems","Demodulation","Detectors","Radial basis function networks","Additive noise","Gaussian noise","Spread spectrum communication","Working environment noise","Adaptive algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","code division multiple access","demodulation","Gaussian noise","adaptive signal detection","feedforward neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive multiuser demodulation","neural network techniques","direct-sequence spread-spectrum multiple-access","DS/SSMA","additive Gaussian noise","interfering users signals","optimal receiver","suboptimal receivers","adaptive algorithms","radial basis functions","equalization","RBF networks","system parameters","group detection","optimal detector","optimal synchronous detector","decorrelating detector","single layer perceptron detector","clustering techniques","adaptive least mean squares methods"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/339913/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"Neural network techniques for adaptive multiuser demodulation","volume":"12","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4860431","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network techniques for adaptive multiuser demodulation","sourcePdf":"00339913.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056224S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"99","articleId":"339913","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":339914,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Keun Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"lastName":"Young-Keun Park","id":"37087306287"},{"name":"V.

Since they have a unique path between source and destination and the intermediate nodes of the paths are shared, internal blocking can cause very poor throughput. This paper proposes a high throughput ATM switch consisting of an Omega network with a new form of input queues called bypass queues. We also improve the switch throughput by partitioning the Input buffers into disjoint buffer sets and multiplexing several sets of nonblocking cells within a time slot, assuming that the routing switch operates only a couple of times faster than the transmission rate. A neural network model is presented as a controller for cell scheduling and multiplexing in the switch. Our simulation results under uniform traffic show that the proposed approach achieves almost 100% of potential switch throughput.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.339914","startPage":"1471","endPage":"1480","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7963/00339914.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.339914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Omega network-based ATM switch with neural network-controlled bypass queueing and multiplexing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Asynchronous transfer mode","Neural networks","Throughput","Routing","Packet switching","B-ISDN","Quality of service","Communication switching","Multiprocessor interconnection networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous transfer mode","B-ISDN","multistage interconnection networks","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication traffic","queueing theory","neural nets","time division multiplexing","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ATM switch","neural network control","bypass queueing","multistage interconnection networks","switching networks","throughput","Omega network","input queues","input buffers","nonblocking cells","routing switch","transmission rate","neural network model","controller","cell scheduling","simulation result","uniform traffic","B-ISDN","TDM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/339914/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"Omega network-based ATM switch with neural network-controlled bypass queueing and multiplexing","volume":"12","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4860432","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Omega network-based ATM switch with neural network-controlled bypass queueing and multiplexing","sourcePdf":"00339914.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04344S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"13","articleId":"339914","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":339915,"authors":[{"name":"Yiu-Wing Leung","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic Institute, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Yiu-Wing Leung","id":"37271603500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0733-8716"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0008"}],"articleNumber":"339915","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":24},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scheduling algorithm","Optical receivers","Optical transmitters","Packet switching","Optical packet switching","Optical filters","High speed optical techniques","Neurons","Optical switches","Optical fiber networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time division multiplexing","neural nets","queueing theory","scheduling","telecommunication switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural scheduling algorithms","time-multiplex switches","transmission conflict resolution","input adaptors","packet transmission","output adaptor","processing elements","conflict-free transmission schedules","maximum throughput","input queue","suboptimal transmission schedules","simulation results","throughput efficiency","neurons"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=339915","abstract":"In an N/spl times/N time-multiplex switch, transmission conflict arises when two or more input adaptors transmit packets to the same output adaptor simultaneously.

The second algorithm resolves transmission conflict among the first M packets in each input queue. It determines suboptimal transmission schedules using only NM neurons (M<N). M is a design parameter: if M is larger, we can find closer-to-optimal transmission schedules, but we need more neurons. Simulation results show that the first algorithm can find near-global optimal transmission schedules. The second algorithm can give close-to-optimal transmission schedules using only a small M.

Such CDMA overlay systems could provide new options for efficient utilization of the spectrum with minimal disruption to existing narrowband users, especially if adaptive interference suppression techniques are utilized in the spread spectrum receiver. Previous studies have defined the SNR improvement ratio which can be achieved for tone interferers and for narrowband interferers for which the center frequency of the interference is at the carrier frequency of the CDMA signal. In this paper the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the mobile-to-base link of a CDMA system for a single narrowband user which occupies a significant portion of the CDMA bandwidth is evaluated. It is shown that the narrowband model used in previous studies does not apply in this case, especially for the large, effective, bandwidths which are characteristic of the interferers in the overlay system. The dependence of the BER on the filter order, the bandwidth of the interference, and its center frequency relative to the CDMA carrier frequency are defined. Additionally the increase in BER for a digital implementation of the adaptive suppression filter relative to the optimal Wiener filter is characterized with respect to the adaptive time constant and the quantization errors due to finite wordlength. It is shown that these implementation errors can be made negligible compared to the errors which are characteristic of the optimal Wiener filter. Analytic results are validated by simulation for typical system parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.339919","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7963/00339919.pdf","startPage":"1510","endPage":"1523","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.339919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive interference suppression for CDMA overlay systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=339919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/339919/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive interference suppression for CDMA overlay systems","volume":"12","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4860437","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive interference suppression for CDMA overlay systems","sourcePdf":"00339919.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036876S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"16","articleId":"339919","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":339922,"authors":[{"name":"Soo-Chang Pei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Soo-Chang Pei","id":"37271112500"},{"name":"Chien-Cheng Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chien-Cheng Tseng","id":"37275611400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0733-8716"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0008"}],"articleNumber":"339922","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":98,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":368},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Least squares approximation","Adaptive algorithm","Adaptive filters","Signal processing algorithms","IIR filters","Minimization","Gaussian processes","Signal processing","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","interference (signal)","least mean squares methods","adaptive filters","FIR filters","filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive FIR filter","least mean p-power error criterion","convex function","filter coefficients","input process","desired proces","Gaussian processes","optimum solution","nonGaussian processes","error adaptive algorithm","impulsive noise","interference"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=339922","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7963/00339922.pdf","startPage":"1540","endPage":"1547","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.339922","doi":"10.1109/49.339922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7963","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Least mean p-power error criterion for adaptive FIR filter","abstract":"An adaptive FIR filter based on the least mean p-power error (MPE) criterion is investigated. First, some useful properties of MPE function are studied. Three main results are as follows: 1) MPE function is a convex function of filter coefficients; so it has no local minima. 2) When input process and desired process are both Gaussian processes, then MPE function has the same optimum solution as the conventional Wiener solution for any p. 3) When input process and desired process are non-Gaussian processes, then MPE function may have better optimum solution than Wiener solution. Next, a least mean p-power (LMP) error adaptive algorithm is derived and some application examples are presented. Consequently, when the signal is corrupted by an impulsive noise, the adaptive algorithm with p=1 is preferred. Furthermore, when the signal is corrupted by noise or interference, the adaptive algorithm with proper choice of p may be preferred.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/339922/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","volume":"12","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"4860440","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Least mean p-power error criterion for adaptive FIR filter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Least mean p-power error criterion for adaptive FIR filter","sourcePdf":"00339922.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052209S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"98","articleId":"339922","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":339929,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Previous work has assumed that the states in the system model are exhaustive. This can be a significant drawback in real-world fault monitoring applications where it is difficult if not impossible to model all the possible fault states of the system in advance. In this paper a method is described for extending the Markov monitoring approach to allow for unknown or novel states which cannot be accounted for when the model is being designed. The method is described and evaluated on data from one of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Deep Space Network antennas. The experimental results indicate that the method is both practical and effective, allowing both discrimination between known states and detection of previously unknown fault conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.339929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7963","startPage":"1600","endPage":"1612","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7963/00339929.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Markov monitoring with unknown states","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/339929/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1994","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Markov monitoring with unknown states","publicationDate":"Dec. 1994","accessionNumber":"4860447","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"9","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Markov monitoring with unknown states","sourcePdf":"00339929.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035017S","chronDate":"Dec 1994","isNumber":"7963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"53","articleId":"339929","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"}]
