Deep Learning based models such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) have been increasingly applied to perform temporal and multi-dimensional prediction of future spectrum characteristics. These models have shown excellent capabilities to learn the correlations in the historical spectrum observations and make next-step predictions. Moreover, to achieve better accuracy, cooperative spectrum prediction using multiple local predictors is known to be a promising technique compared to a single local predictor. Cooperative prediction can also potentially lead to increased spectrum utilization efficiency and energy efficiency. Therefore, in this work, we study different soft fusion and hard fusion methods to perform cooperative spectrum prediction of spectrum occupancy in a cognitive radio environment with trained LSTM-based local predictors. The proposed methods indicate a reduction in the prediction error compared to local prediction and most hard fusion methods.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9660213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCS53099.2021.9660229","publicationTitle":"2021 15th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 15th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9660209/9660213/09660229.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCS53099.2021.9660229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft Fusion based Cooperative Spectrum Prediction using LSTM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Soft Fusion based Cooperative Spectrum Prediction using LSTM","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9660229/","publicationDate":"13 Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9660229/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft Fusion based Cooperative Spectrum Prediction using LSTM","confLoc":"Sydney, Australia","sourcePdf":"pc7-1570758371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055457S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9660209","isNumber":"9660213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9660209","xplore-issue":"9660213","articleId":"9660229","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9660275,"authors":[{"name":"Jun\u2019An Zhang","affiliation":["College of Artificial intelligence, Chongqing University of Technology, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Jun\u2019An","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37089219011"},{"name":"Yi Xu","affiliation":["College of Artificial intelligence, Chongqing University of Technology, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Xu","id":"37089218973"},{"name":"Cong Peng","affiliation":["College of Artificial intelligence, Chongqing University of Technology, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Cong","lastName":"Peng","id":"37089217312"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-5886-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-5885-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-5887-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9660275","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"abstract":"An optocoupler chip is proposed in this paper based on BiCMOS process.

However, in practice, a new appliance may be added to the set of electrical appliances, an appliance may be replaced by a new one, the efficiency of an appliance may change during the time, or a fault may occur. All these issues of appliances cause abnormal consumption in total signal and not detecting them reduces the NILM accuracy. In this sense, submetering is widely used to address the above challenge. However, it leads to additional costs for consumers as it requires additional meters, disturbs consumers\u2019 comfort and privacy, and is not scalable. In this paper, the non-intrusive load monitoring approach is utilized to detect the above anomalies based on two main factors: 1) the power distribution and 2) the participation index of appliances. Since the proposed method is nonintrusive it is cost-efficient and accommodates the consumer\u2019s privacy and comfort. Furthermore, detecting all the above appliance anomalies not only increases the NILM accuracy but also reduces energy waste and avoids appliance breakdown. The experimental results prove that the proposed method yields outstanding performance in detecting the aforementioned anomalies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9660385/","volume":"67","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/9660385/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2021","displayDocTitle":"Appliance-Level Anomaly Detection in Nonintrusive Load Monitoring via Power Consumption-Based Feature Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Appliance-Level Anomaly Detection in Nonintrusive Load Monitoring via Power Consumption-Based Feature Analysis","sourcePdf":"tce-hamidibeheshti-3129356-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051982S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"9660829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","xplore-issue":"9660829","articleId":"9660385","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":9660423,"authors":[{"name":"Igbafe Orikumhi","affiliation":["Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Igbafe","lastName":"Orikumhi"},{"name":"Jeongwan Kang","affiliation":["Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jeongwan","lastName":"Kang"},{"name":"Sunwoo Kim","affiliation":["Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sunwoo","lastName":"Kim"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0582-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0581-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0583-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-4955"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2374-0272"}],"articleNumber":"9660423","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Uncertainty","Conferences","Focusing","Massive MIMO","Noise measurement","Millimeter wave communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beam Alignment","Location-aware Communication","Codebook","Initial Access","Beam Management"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9660423","abstract":"Beam alignment is required in millimeter wave communication to ensure high data rate transmission. However, with narrow beamwidth in massive MIMO, beam alignment could be computationally intensive due to the large number of beam pairs to be measured. In this paper, we propose an efficient beam alignment framework by exploiting the location information of the user equipment (UE) and potential reflecting points. The proposed scheme allows the UE and the base station to perform a coordinated beam search from a small set of beams within the error boundary of the location information, the selected beams are then used to guide the search of future beams. To further reduce the number of beams to be searched, we propose an intelligent search scheme within a small window of beams to determine the direction of the actual beam. The proposed beam alignment algorithm is verified on simulation with some location uncertainty.","doi":"10.1109/IC-NIDC54101.2021.9660423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IC-NIDC54101.2021.9660423","startPage":"215","endPage":"219","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 7th IEEE International Conference on Network Intelligence and Digital Content (IC-NIDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9660393/9660398/09660423.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 7th IEEE International Conference on Network Intelligence and Digital Content (IC-NIDC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9660398","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Location-Aided Window based Beam Alignment for mmWave Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Nov. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Location-Aided Window based Beam Alignment for mmWave Communications","conferenceDate":"17-19 Nov. 2021","publicationDate":"17 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2022","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9660423/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9660423/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010418","fundingName":"Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning Evaluation (IITP)","grantNumber":"20180-01659"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"2020R1I1A1A01073438"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Location-Aided Window based Beam Alignment for mmWave Communications","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"044-197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047423S","chronDate":"17-19 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9660393","isNumber":"9660398","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9660393","xplore-issue":"9660398","articleId":"9660423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9660448,"authors":[{"name":"Boyang Yu","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Communications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Boyang","lastName":"Yu"},{"name":"Xin Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Communications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Zhang"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0582-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0581-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0583-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-4955"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2374-0272"}],"articleNumber":"9660448","dbTime":"1 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Computer vision","Target tracking","Costs","Array signal processing","Channel capacity","5G mobile communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","Beamforming","Binocular Vision"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9660448","abstract":"The increasing construction of 5G dense network creates the conditions for the application of Massive MIMO system. However, with the continuous expansion of business requirements, users put forward higher requirements for the number of antennas in MIMO system. With the increase of the number of antennas, the cost of traditional MIMO beamforming algorithm for channel detection and feedback will increase rapidly, which consumes more wire-less resources and greatly increases the computational burden of the system. The use of computer vision aids provides convenience for the beamforming method to track the target accurately under LOS condition. Combined with image tracking algorithm, the position of the target in each image frame can be calculated so that the angle information of LOS path and the best beam-forming scheme can be determined directly, which can reduce the cost and calculation of the system through wireless resource measurement and feed-back. As a result, the operation speed and accuracy of the system are improved. In this paper, a beamforming method based on binocular positioning is studied. Compared with the traditional method, this method can reduce the number of codeword searches and improve the channel capacity in high-density 5G network.","doi":"10.1109/IC-NIDC54101.2021.9660448","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IC-NIDC54101.2021.9660448","startPage":"168","endPage":"171","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 7th IEEE

Real-time Energy Management of Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles","abstract":"Representation model provides a way to deploy offline optimization results into the controller of hybrid vehicles for real-time energy management. To enable knowledge transfer for more efficient representation modelling, this paper proposed a transferable representation modelling method by incorporating fuzzy inference system with Gaussian process regression into a hybrid learning network. Topology of the hybrid network is studied, and the \u2018deeper\u2019 topology is recommended as a unified topology to transfer the offline optimization results obtained in source domain to new target domains. Hardware-in-the-loop tests are conducted for experimental evaluations. By introducing a concept of control utility that evaluates vehicle energy efficiency with a penalty on usage of battery, the proposed model can help the studied hybrid vehicle achieve more than 27% higher control utility than neural-network-based models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9661134/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9661134/","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2022","publicationDate":"29 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Transferable Representation Model Driven by Gaussion Process Regression for Real-time Energy Management of Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011283","fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Automotive Safety and Energy"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transferable Representation Model Driven by Gaussion Process Regression for Real-time Energy Management of Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"0084.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083066S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9661115","isNumber":"9661116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9661115","xplore-issue":"9661116","articleId":"9661134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9661164,"authors":[{"name":"Yuqiang Jin","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yuqiang","lastName":"Jin","id":"37089018936"},{"name":"Biao Liu","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Biao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37089224784"},{"name":"Minglei Fu","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Minglei","lastName":"Fu","id":"37397771400"},{"name":"Huihua Lyu","affiliation":["Hangzhou Hopechart IoT Technology Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Huihua","lastName":"Lyu","id":"37089224765"},{"name":"Wen-An Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wen-An","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37404212400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0847-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0848-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9661164","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Learning systems","Space vehicles","Robustness","Real-time systems","Encoding","Trajectory","Proposals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["data-driven","motion planning","learning-based method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9661164","doi":"10.1109/CVCI54083.2021.9661164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVCI54083.2021.9661164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9661116","publicationTitle":"2021 5th CAA International Conference on Vehicular Control and Intelligence (CVCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 5th CAA International Conference on Vehicular Control and Intelligence (CVCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9661115/9661116/09661164.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-driven Motion Planner for Autonomous Vehicle using an Ensemble of Global Map and Local view","abstract":"We present a data-driven motion planner for the trajectory generation in a complex environment based on the global map and the vehicle-centric local view, and demonstrate that the two parts can improve each other.

Then, global planner provides global information guidance for the local planners and ensemble planner composed of the two predicts feasible paths through an iterative update mechanism.

They use social engineering skills to trick users into visiting phishing websites and entering crucial personal information. In the end, the stolen personal information is used to defraud the trust of regular websites or financial institutions to obtain illegal benefits. With the development and applications of machine learning technology, many machine learning-based solutions for detecting phishing have been proposed. Some solutions are based on the features extracted by rules, and some of the features need to rely on third-party services, which will cause instability and time-consuming issues in the prediction service. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based framework for detecting phishing websites. We have implemented the framework as a browser plug-in capable of determining whether there is a phishing risk in real-time when the user visits a web page and gives a warning message. The real-time prediction service combines multiple strategies to improve accuracy, reduce false alarm rates, and reduce calculation time, including whitelist filtering, blacklist interception, and machine learning (ML) prediction. In the ML prediction module, we compared multiple machine learning models using several datasets. From the experimental results, the RNN-GRU model obtained the highest accuracy of 99.18%, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed solution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9661323/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9661323/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2022","publicationDate":"2022","volume":"10","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Deep Learning-Based Framework for Phishing Website Detection","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Deep Learning-Based Framework for Phishing Website Detection","sourcePdf":"access-mahmoud-3137636-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082388S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9668973","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9668973","articleId":"9661323","onlineDate":"23 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9661325,"authors":[{"name":"Zinon Zinonos","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems Laboratory, Neapolis University Pafos, Paphos, Cyprus","CYENS Centre of Excellence, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9668973/9661325/zinon-3138050-small.gif","p":["Zinon Zinonos (Member, IEEE) received the Diploma degree in computer engineering from the Computer Engineering and Informatics Department (CEID), University of Patras, Greece, in 2005, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Computer Science, University of Cyprus, in 2008 and 2013, respectively, all in computer science.

Long Range (LoRa) is one such protocol, which is excellent for transferring data over long distances but has generated severe doubts regarding the viability of image transmission due to its low data rate. This paper demonstrates the application results of an integrated LoRa and Deep Learning-based computer vision system that can efficiently identify grape leaf diseases using low-resolution images. In particular, the focus in this paper is to combine the two technologies, LoRa and Deep Learning, to make the transmission of the images and the identification of the diseases possible. To achieve this objective, the framework utilizes a combination of on-site and simulation experiments along with different LoRa parameters and Convolutional Neural Model (CNN) model fine-tuning. Based on the evaluation, the proposed framework proved that the transmission of images using LoRa is possible within the protocol limitations (such as limited bandwidth and low duty cycle). Our fine-tuned model can efficiently identify grape leaves diseases. The technique is both efficient and adaptive to the specifics of each leaf disease, while it does not need any training data to adjust parameters. It is worth noting that today, end-user trust in Machine and Deep Learning models has increased significantly because of novel solutions in the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). In this study, we use the Grad-CAM method to visualize the output layer judgments of the CNN. The disease\u2019s spot region is highly activated, according to the visualization findings.

By adding a short stub in parallel to the radial stub, DC path to the ground and stabilization in the lower frequency range are obtained. After the S-parameters comparison between FET with ideally grounded source and that with the radial stub, two types of 130 GHz amplifiers with two types of FETs have been fabricated in 65nm CMOS process.

We develop the theoretical foundation for time-domain, phase-based, joint maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of the unknown carrier frequency and the initial carrier phase, with simultaneous maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation of the time-varying carrier phase noise. The derivation is based on the amplitude and phase-form of the noisy received signal model together with the use of the best, linearized, additive observation phase noise model due to AWGN. Our newly derived estimators are closed-form expressions, consisting of both the phase and the magnitude of all the received signal samples. More importantly, they all have a low-complexity, sample-by-sample iterative processing structure, which can be implemented iteratively in real-time. As a basis for comparison, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the ML estimators and the Bayesian CRLB (BCRLB) for the MAP estimator are derived in the presence of carrier phase noise, and the results simply depend on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the observation length and the phase noise variance. It is theoretically shown that the estimates obtained are unbiased, and the mean-square error (MSE) of the estimators attain the CRLB/BCRLB at high SNR. The MSE performance as a function of the SNR, the observation length and the phase noise variance is verified using Monte Carlo simulation, which shows a remarkable improvement in estimation accuracy in large phase noise.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9662238/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","volume":"70","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","publicationDate":"2022","htmlLink":"/document/9662238/","displayDocTitle":"Joint ML/MAP Estimation of the Frequency and Phase of a Single Sinusoid With Wiener Carrier Phase Noise","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013290","fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2019YFB1803305"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571316"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Joint ML/MAP Estimation of the Frequency and Phase of a Single Sinusoid With Wiener Carrier Phase Noise","sourcePdf":"tsp-quan-3137966-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100786S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9675017","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9675017","articleId":"9662238","onlineDate":"23 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2022-01-21"},{"_id":9662241,"authors":[{"name":"Yuen-Man Pun","affiliation":["Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9675017/9662241/pun-3137953-small.gif","p":["Yuen-Man Pun received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics and M.Phil. degree in systems engineering and engineering management from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Hong Kong.

Specifically, we formulate the problem as that of sequential TOA-based source localization and apply online gradient descent (OGD) to it to generate the position estimates of the target. To analyze the tracking performance of OGD, we first revisit the classic least-squares formulation of the (static) TOA-based source localization problem and elucidate its estimation and geometric properties. In particular, under standard assumptions on the TOA measurement model, we establish a bound on the distance between an optimal solution to the least-squares formulation and the true target position. Using this bound, we show that the loss function in the formulation, albeit non-convex in general, is locally strongly convex at its global minima. To the best of our knowledge, these results are new and can be of independent interest. By combining them with existing techniques from online strongly convex optimization, we then establish the first non-trivial bound on the cumulative target tracking error of OGD. Our numerical results corroborate the theoretical findings and show that OGD can effectively track the target at different noise levels.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3137953","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3137953","startPage":"190","endPage":"201","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9675017/09662241.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9675017","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local Strong Convexity of Source Localization and Error Bound for Target Tracking under Time-of-Arrival Measurements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","displayDocTitle":"Local Strong Convexity of Source Localization and Error Bound for Target Tracking under Time-of-Arrival Measurements","publicationDate":"2022","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","volume":"70","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9662241/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9662241/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"CUHK Research Sustainability of Major RGC Funding Schemes","grantNumber":"3133236"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local Strong Convexity of Source Localization and Error Bound for Target Tracking under Time-of-Arrival Measurements","sourcePdf":"tsp-so-3137953-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090026S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9675017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9675017","articleId":"9662241","onlineDate":"23 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9662255,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Hoher","affiliation":["Institute of System Dynamics, University of Applied Sciences, Konstanz, Germany"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Hoher","orcid":"0000-0002-6815-8010"},{"name":"Stefan Wirtensohn","affiliation":["Institute of System Dynamics, University of Applied Sciences, Konstanz, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Wirtensohn"},{"name":"Tim Baur","affiliation":["Institute of System Dynamics, University of Applied Sciences, Konstanz, Germany"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Baur","orcid":"0000-0002-7168-0205"},{"name":"Johannes Reuter","affiliation":["Institute of System Dynamics, University of Applied Sciences, Konstanz, Germany"],"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Reuter","orcid":"0000-0003-2069-5682"},{"name":"Felix Govaers","affiliation":["Fraunhofer-FKIE, Sensordata, and Information Fusion, Wachtberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Felix","lastName":"Govaers","orcid":"0000-0003-2274-7503"},{"name":"Wolfgang Koch","affiliation":["Fraunhofer-FKIE, Sensordata, and Information Fusion, Wachtberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Koch","orcid":"0000-0002-5734-3325"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"9662255","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":23},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"Random matrices are widely used to estimate the extent of an elliptically contoured object. Usually, it is assumed that the measurements follow a normal distribution, with its standard deviation being proportional to the object\u2019s extent. However, the random matrix approach can filter the center of gravity and the covariance matrix of measurements independently of the measurement model. This work considers the whole chain from data acquisition to the linear Kalman Filter with extension estimation as a reference plant. The input is the (unknown) ground truth (position and extent). The output is the filtered center of gravity and the filtered covariance matrix of the measurement distribution. A virtual measurement model emulates the behavior of the reference plant. The input of the virtual measurement model is adapted using the proposed algorithm until the output parameters of the virtual measurement model match the result of the reference plant. After the adaptation, the input to the virtual measurement model is considered an estimation for position and extent. The main contribution of this paper is the reference model concept and an adaptation algorithm to optimize the input of the virtual measurement model.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrices","Adaptation models","Noise measurement","Laser radar","Gravity","Time measurement","Estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Extended object tracking","random matrices","lidar","reference model","extension estimation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3138006","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9675017/09662255.pdf","startPage":"228","endPage":"239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9675017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3138006","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extended Target Tracking With a Lidar Sensor Using Random Matrices and a Virtual Measurement Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9662255","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Extended Target Tracking With a Lidar Sensor Using Random Matrices and a Virtual Measurement Model","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9662255/","volume":"70","publicationDate":"2022","htmlLink":"/document/9662255/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008316","fundingName":"Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Stiftung"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extended Target Tracking With a Lidar Sensor Using Random Matrices and a Virtual Measurement Model","sourcePdf":"tsp-hoher-3138006-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090093S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9675017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9675017","articleId":"9662255","onlineDate":"23 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9662311,"authors":[{"name":"Nina \u017di\u017eaki\u0107","affiliation":["TELIN\u2013GAIM, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9668973/9662311/zizak-3138168-small.gif","p":["Nina \u017di\u017eaki\u0107 (Member, IEEE) received the bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in computer science from the University of Novi Sad, Serbia, in 2014 and 2017, respectively.

In addition to this analysis, we give insights into the difficulties and the importance of selecting right evaluation techniques during the unsupervised learning of the local image descriptors. We explore the extent to which a simple perceptual metric during training can predict the performance on tasks such as patch matching, retrieval and verification.

We obtain it from the first and direct path of arrival (FDPoA) in a corresponding set of multipath components (MPC) of the underlying channel state information (CSI). While detection of the FDPoA under Line-of-Sight (LoS) is simple, it is prone to errors in environments with specular and diffuse reflections, as well as nonlinear diffraction, absorption, and transmission of a signal. Such Obstructed- or Non-Line-of-Sight (OLoS, NLoS) situations lead to incorrect FDPoA and consequently to incorrect ToA estimates and inaccurate positions. State-of-the-art estimators are computationally expensive and usually fail with O/NLoS at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).We propose a deep learning (DL) approach to identify optimal FDPoAs as ToA directly from the raw CSI. Our 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) learns the spatial distribution of MPCs of the CSI to predict correct estimates of the ToA. To train our DL model, we use QuaDRiGa to generate datasets with CIRs and ground truth ToAs for realistic 5G channel models.

These systems must remain as flexible as possible to adapt to heterogeneous traffic demands, while also delivering the highest possible rate for dedicated services. Satellites flexible payloads are increasingly employing wideband output multiplexers. In this context, it is now more important than ever to evaluate frequency-dependent degradations on multicarrier signals. In particular, it is critical to characterize the distortions entailed by the output multiplexers filters. In this paper, models are presented and novel formulas are derived to determine the carrier-to-interference ratio resulting from these distortions. Derivations are oriented towards the applicability of either high-accuracy (e.g., for link budget) or low-complexity calculations (e.g., for real-time carrier allocation). The influence of key parameters such as the optimal decision instant, symbol rate and roll-off factor is thoroughly analyzed. Furthermore, formulas are evaluated in a practical scenario: the dynamic carrier allocation optimization. They are combined with efficient optimization algorithms to obtain the best performance based on user fairness. Relevant metrics such as accuracy, complexity and allocation gain are also investigated. In the end, the application of the proposed formulas and algorithms leads to a significant allocation gain that is increasing with the number of carriers. The feasibility of real-time dynamic carrier allocation to further increase the capacity of the next generation of satellite systems is emphasized.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3138238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3138238","startPage":"292","endPage":"306","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9675017/09662973.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9675017","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Filter Distortions in Ultra High-Throughput Satellites: Models, Parameters and Multicarrier Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","displayDocTitle":"Filter Distortions in Ultra High-Throughput Satellites: Models, Parameters and Multicarrier Optimization","publicationDate":"2022","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2022","volume":"70","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9662973/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9662973/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Digitalization and Technology Research Center of the Bundeswehr"},{"fundingName":"Seamless Radio Access Networks in the Internet of Space","grantNumber":"150009910"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Filter Distortions in Ultra High-Throughput Satellites: Models, Parameters and Multicarrier Optimization","sourcePdf":"tsp-colin-3138238-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093116S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9675017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9675017","articleId":"9662973","onlineDate":"24 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-14","associateArticle":[{"associateType":"Preprint","associateDoi":"10.36227/techrxiv.14723916"}]},{"_id":9662974,"authors":[{"name":"Amrit Singh Bedi","affiliation":["U.S. Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9675017/9662974/amrit-3138242-small.gif","p":["Amrit Singh Bedi received the Diploma degree in electronics and communication engineering from Guru Nanak Dev Polytechnic College, Ludhiana, India, in 2009, the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communication engineering from the Rayat and Bahra Institute of Engineering and Bio-Technology, Kharar, India, in 2012, the M.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, Kanpur, India, in 2016, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from IIT Kanpur, in 2018.

First-order algorithms under suitable randomized perturbations or step-size rules have been shown to be effective for such settings as their limit points can be guaranteed to be local extrema rather than saddle points. However, it is well-known that the practical convergence of first-order methods is slower than those which exploit additional structure. In particular, empirically, successive convex approximation (SCA) converges faster than first-order methods. However, to date, SCA in general non-convex settings converges to first-order stationary points, which could either be local extrema or saddle points whose performance is typically inferior. To mitigate this issue, we propose calibrated randomized perturbations of SCA, which exhibit the improved convergence rate as compared to the gradient descent counter part. In particular, our main technical contributions are to establish the non-asymptotic performance of SCA algorithm and its perturbed variant converges to an approximate second-order stationary point. Experiments on multi-dimensional scaling, a machine learning problem whose training objective is non-convex, substantiate the performance gains associated with employing random perturbations.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9675017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3138242","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9675017/09662974.pdf","startPage":"307","endPage":"321","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3138242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Escaping Saddle Points for Successive Convex Approximation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","displayDocTitle":"Escaping Saddle Points for Successive Convex Approximation","volume":"70","htmlLink":"/document/9662974/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2022","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2022","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9662974/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006754","fundingName":"Army Research Laboratory","grantNumber":"W911NF-16-2-0008"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Escaping Saddle Points for Successive Convex Approximation","sourcePdf":"tsp-rajawat-3138242-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088383S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9675017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9675017","articleId":"9662974","onlineDate":"24 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-14"},{"_id":9663583,"authors":[{"name":"Shreeram Suresh Chandra","affiliation":["PES University, Bengaluru, India"],"firstName":"Shreeram Suresh","lastName":"Chandra","id":"37088378581"},{"name":"Akshay Upadhye","affiliation":["PES University, Bengaluru, India"],"firstName":"Akshay","lastName":"Upadhye","id":"37088863165"},{"name":"Purushothaman Saravanan","affiliation":["PES University, Bengaluru, India"],"firstName":"Purushothaman","lastName":"Saravanan","id":"37088862311"},{"name":"Sanjeev Gurugopinath","affiliation":["PES University, Bengaluru, India"],"firstName":"Sanjeev","lastName":"Gurugopinath","id":"38234741300"},{"name":"R.

While SAO contributes to a significant increase in coding efficiency, the complexity of in-loop filtering in HEVC encoding is dominated by the estimation of SAO parameters. The SAO estimation primarily includes two phases: the statistics collection phase and the parameter determination phase. The statistics collection phase involves calculating sum and count for band and edge offset. The parameter determination phase involves distortion and offset generation, cost generation and decision, SAO type decision and finally, merge mode decision.

SDN architecture has two planes namely control and data plane. Control plane manages the network using global view of the network topology and data plane helps routing and forwarding of packets. Centralised nature of controller poses security threats to SDN environment. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is the most popular cyber attack which can cause economic loss due to network disruption. Thus, the design of DDoS detection system which can detect the attacks accurately in SDN environment is an important research issue. The purpose of this study is to develop a real-time method for detecting DDoS attacks using a bi-directional recurrent neural network (BRNN). We use deep learning models for the classification of DDoS attacks with real-time SDN data.Results demonstrated that BRNN has greater accuracy than feed forward neural network when we use Mininet emulator to create SDN environment.","doi":"10.1109/DISCOVER52564.2021.9663667","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DISCOVER52564.2021.9663667","startPage":"123","endPage":"128","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing, VLSI, Electrical Circuits and Robotics (DISCOVER)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9663568/9663422/09663667.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing, VLSI, Electrical Circuits and Robotics (DISCOVER)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9663422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DDoS Attack Detection in SDN Environment using Bi-directional Recurrent Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 Nov. 2021","displayDocTitle":"DDoS Attack Detection in SDN Environment using Bi-directional Recurrent Neural Network","conferenceDate":"19-20 Nov. 2021","publicationDate":"19 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2022","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9663667/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9663667/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DDoS Attack Detection in SDN Environment using Bi-directional Recurrent Neural Network","confLoc":"Nitte, India","sourcePdf":"24Paper_254.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070648S","chronDate":"19-20 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9663568","isNumber":"9663422","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9663568","xplore-issue":"9663422","articleId":"9663667","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9663695,"authors":[{"name":"G.B Rakshith","affiliation":["Advanced Video BU, Ittiam Systems Pvt.

Among several well-known features for audio tagging, log-mel is widely-used. Therefore, log-mel has been used to train and establish a near-perfect accurate PANN for audio tagging. For the classification problem at hand, we study the performance of MT numerator group delay (MT-NGD) and MT magnitude (MT-Mag) spectral features and compare it with the log-mel feature. Our experimental results on the MARSYAS speech and music database shows that the accuracy of the PANN converges faster as opposed to other features, when trained with MT-NGD spectrogram. Further, the multitaper representations are observed to be robust to the presence of noise in both speech and music.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Databases","Conferences","Neural networks","Tagging","Very large scale integration","Delays","Distributed computing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Log-mel feature","multitaper magnitude","multitaper numerator group delay","pretrained audio neural networks","speech and music classification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DISCOVER52564.2021.9663695","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing, VLSI, Electrical Circuits and Robotics (DISCOVER)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing, VLSI, Electrical Circuits and Robotics (DISCOVER)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9663568/9663422/09663695.pdf","startPage":"78","endPage":"83","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9663422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DISCOVER52564.2021.9663695","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multitaper Spectrogram for Classification of Speech and Music With Pretrained Audio Neural Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9663695","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multitaper Spectrogram for Classification of Speech and Music With Pretrained Audio Neural Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9663695/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"19 Nov. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9663695/","conferenceDate":"19-20 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2022","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 Nov. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multitaper Spectrogram for Classification of Speech and Music With Pretrained Audio Neural Networks","confLoc":"Nitte, India","sourcePdf":"15Paper_217.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069915S","chronDate":"19-20 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9663568","isNumber":"9663422","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9663568","xplore-issue":"9663422","articleId":"9663695","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9664398,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Amirkhany","affiliation":["Samsung Display America Lab, San Jose, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/9664397/9664398/amirk-3127053-small.gif","p":["Amir Amirkhany (Senior Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1995, the M.Sc. degree from the University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA, in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA, all in electrical engineering, in 2008.","He is the Head of Samsung Display America Laboratory, San Jose, CA, USA.

To this, the composite field arithmetic (CFA) is employed to optimize all building blocks in S-box (and inverse S-box) of SubBytes (and inverse SubBytes) transformation. A joint design of S-box and inverse S-box is also proposed to further enhance the area efficiency. Specifically, the area of multiplier in the Galois composite field, GF\n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$((2^{2})^{2})$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n, is reduced.

Furthermore, the S-box and inverse S-box are combined and optimized using the pre_processing and post_processing modules. To increase the throughput, a balanced and pipelined architecture is derived. Using the proposed architecture, a throughput of 5.79 Gbps for the S-box can be achieved on Virtex-6 XC6VLX240T and 10% better than the conventional work. According to the ASIC implementation result, the proposed design can still achieve the highest area efficiency and approximately 30% better than conventional works using TSMC 90nm process.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3139040","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9668973/09664518.pdf","startPage":"2721","endPage":"2728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9668973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3139040","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2021","displayDocTitle":"VLSI Architecture of S-Box With High Area Efficiency Based on Composite Field Arithmetic","volume":"10","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9664518/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","publicationDate":"2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9664518/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministry of Education, Taiwan","grantNumber":"PEE1100748"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"VLSI Architecture of S-Box With High Area Efficiency Based on Composite Field Arithmetic","sourcePdf":"access-chin-3139040-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091418S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9668973","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9668973","articleId":"9664518","onlineDate":"28 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9664582,"authors":[{"name":"Federica Lago","affiliation":["University of Trento, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Federica Lago (federica.lago-1@unitn.it) received her M.Sc. degree in computer science from the University of Trento, 38123, Italy, in 2017, where she is currently a Ph.D. candidate in the IECS Doctoral School.

Although early deep fakes were easy to spot, technology has improved, and whether or not they can fool a human\u2019s visual system is still unknown.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9664581","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2021.3120982","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/79/9664581/09664582.pdf","startPage":"109","endPage":"116","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2021.3120982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"More Real Than Real: A Study on Human Visual Perception of Synthetic Faces [Applications Corner]","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","displayDocTitle":"More Real Than Real: A Study on Human Visual Perception of Synthetic Faces [Applications Corner]","volume":"39","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9664582/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9664582/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"More Real Than Real: A Study on Human Visual Perception of Synthetic Faces [Applications Corner]","sourcePdf":"39msp01-applications-3120982-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043058S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"9664581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","xplore-issue":"9664581","articleId":"9664582","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-31"},{"_id":9664583,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-5888"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0792"}],"articleNumber":"9664583","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":" \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9664583","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2021.3118523","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2021.3118523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9664581","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/79/9664581/09664583.pdf","startPage":"2","endPage":"2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"[Masthead]","abstract":"Provides a listing of current staff, committee members and society officers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9664583/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9664583/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2021","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","volume":"39","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"[Masthead]","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"[Masthead]","sourcePdf":"39msp01-masthead-3118523-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.014714S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"9664581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","xplore-issue":"9664581","articleId":"9664583","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":9664584,"authors":[{"name":"P\u00e9ter Kov\u00e1cs","affiliation":["ELTE, Budapest, Hungary","Tampere University of Technology, Finland","Institute of Signal Processing, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria"],"bio":{"p":["P\u00e9ter Kov\u00e1cs (kovika@inf.elte.hu) received his Ph.D. degree in computer science from the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University (ELTE), Budapest, Hungary, in 2016.

Usually, with model-driven evaluation procedures, lateral heat flow is ignored, and, thus, 1D reconstruction is applied to detect defects. However, to correctly size defects, the lateral heat flow must be considered, which requires a full 3D reconstruction. The 3D thermal defect imaging is a major challenge because heat propagation is an irreversible process. The virtual wave concept (VWC) is a recently developed method that considers both lateral and axial heat flows and, therefore, allows multidimensional reconstruction at improved spatial resolution. This approach decomposes the problem into two steps; can be used for 1D, 2D, and 3D heat conduction problems; and provides new alternatives to using physical priors (e.g., nonnegativity and/or sparsity), all of which improve reconstruction accuracy at a relatively low computational cost.","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2021.3120978","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2021.3120978","startPage":"55","endPage":"67","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/79/9664581/09664584.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9664581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Surfing Virtual Waves to Thermal Tomography: From model- to deep learning-based reconstructions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","displayDocTitle":"Surfing Virtual Waves to Thermal Tomography: From model- to deep learning-based reconstructions","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2021","volume":"39","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9664584/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9664584/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002428","fundingName":"Austrian Science Fund","grantNumber":"30747-N32 and P 33019-N"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Surfing Virtual Waves to Thermal Tomography: From model- to deep learning-based reconstructions","sourcePdf":"39msp01-kovacs-3120978-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050915S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"9664581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","xplore-issue":"9664581","articleId":"9664584","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":9664585,"authors":[{"name":"Ali H.

Although in principle deep-learning methods can be applied to boost the performance of processing materials-science images, i.e., microscopic images that capture important microstructures of various material samples, many priors and requirements in materials science must be considered to maximize performance gains. In this article, we focus on the important problem of detecting objects of interest from microscopic materials-science images and introduce different approaches to incorporate several such priors, including object shape, symmetry, and 3D consistency, into deep learning to tackle this problem. In particular, we explore the use of these three priors to enable network training with fewer data annotations, which is highly desired in materials science. This tutorial-style article will summarize contributions in the literature as well as our current research achievements, and we hope it can provide an initial insight to new researchers who are interested in using deep learning for materials-science image processing.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Training data","Three-dimensional displays","Tutorials","Microscopy","Materials science","Object detection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MSP.2021.3121558","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/79/9664581/09664589.pdf","startPage":"78","endPage":"88","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9664581","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2021.3121558","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning for Object Detection in Materials-Science Images: A tutorial","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9664589","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning for Object Detection in Materials-Science Images: A tutorial","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9664589/","volume":"39","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9664589/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning for Object Detection in Materials-Science Images: A tutorial","sourcePdf":"39msp01-fu-3121558-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044807S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"9664581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","xplore-issue":"9664581","articleId":"9664589","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-31"},{"_id":9664590,"authors":[{"name":"Chandler A.

A new, radical proposal to change the way IEEE elevates its Members to Fellow status may finally address the inclusion and equity issues that we discuss but have yet to address. The proposal is still in its infancy and was drafted by a committee chaired by our very own Jose Moura. It recognizes and documents what many of us have known anecdotally: the success rate of Fellow nominations coming from industry, government, and regions outside North America and Europe is abysmally low, despite the quality of the nominees. It also recognizes the sourcing challenge: a small number of nominations from outside academia and North America and Europe to start with. The proposed vetting process continues to involve the different technical communities within IEEE as it should, but adds a few extra provisions in the training, selection, and oversight of the peer-review committees, which have real potential to achieve fairness. I urge you to keep an eye on this developing initiative and contribute to its success by actively participating in its refinement and finalization.","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2021.3127745","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/79/9664581/09664592.pdf","startPage":"4","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9664581","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2021.3127745","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Existential Question [President\u2019s Message]","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9664592","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Existential Question [President\u2019s Message]","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9664592/","volume":"39","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9664592/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Existential Question [President\u2019s Message]","sourcePdf":"39msp01-presmess-3127745-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.013605S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"9664581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","xplore-issue":"9664581","articleId":"9664592","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":9664594,"authors":[{"name":"S.V.

Scientific computed tomography (SCT) instruments are one of the most popular choices for 3D nondestructive characterization of materials at length scales ranging from the angstrom scale to the micron scale. These instruments typically have a source of radiation (such as electrons, X-rays, or neutrons) that interacts with the sample to be studied and a detector assembly to capture the result of this interaction (see \n<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Figure 1</xref>\n). A collection of such high-resolution measurements is made by reorienting the sample, which is mounted on a specially designed stage/holder after which reconstruction algorithms are used to produce the final 3D volume of interest. The specific choice of which instrument to use depends on the desired resolution and properties of the materials being imaged. The end goal of SCT scans includes determining the morphology, chemical composition, or dynamic behavior of materials when subjected to external stimuli. In summary, SCT instruments are powerful tools that enable 3D characterization across multiple length scales and play a critical role in furthering the understanding of the structure\u2013function relationships of different materials.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9664581","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2021.3123594","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/79/9664581/09664594.pdf","startPage":"32","endPage":"43","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2021.3123594","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algorithm-Driven Advances for Scientific CT Instruments: From model-based to deep learning-based approaches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","displayDocTitle":"Algorithm-Driven Advances for Scientific CT Instruments: From model-based to deep learning-based approaches","volume":"39","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9664594/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9664594/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000015","fundingName":"U.S. Department of Energy","grantNumber":"DE-AC05-00OR22725"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1763896"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algorithm-Driven Advances for Scientific CT Instruments: From model-based to deep learning-based approaches","sourcePdf":"39msp01-venkatakrishnan-3123594-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068304S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"9664581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","xplore-issue":"9664581","articleId":"9664594","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":9664595,"authors":[{"name":"Do\u011fa G\u00fcrsoy","affiliation":["Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, Illinois, USA","Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Do\u011fa G\u00fcrsoy (dgursoy@anl.gov) received his Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Graz University of Technology.

What is not often appreciated is that the MRF owes its origin to the physics of solids, making it an ideal prior model for processing microscopic observations of materials. While both fields know of their respective interpretations of the MRF, each knows very little about the other\u2019s version of it. Hence, both fields have \u201cblind spots,\u201d where some concepts readily appreciated by one field are completely obscured from the other. With this in mind, the objectives of this article are to 1) develop a synoptic view of the MRF, the related Gibbs distribution, and the Hammersley\u2013Clifford theorem that links them, in such a way that signal processing and materials readers will see them from the same perspective; and 2) explain physics-based regularization using the MRF and describe how it can provide insight into the performance of MRF-based segmentation methods. While the MRF has already been used in many machine learning contexts, we will use a simpler, more transparent method to illustrate the fundamental behavior of the MRF, with the understanding that this behavior should be inherent in more complex learning approaches.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solid modeling","Markov processes","Machine learning","Object detection","Signal processing","Solids","Microstructure"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MSP.2021.3123564","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/79/9664581/09664606.pdf","startPage":"16","endPage":"24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9664581","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2021.3123564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Markov Random Field in Materials Applications: A synoptic view for signal processing and materials readers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9664606","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Markov Random Field in Materials Applications: A synoptic view for signal processing and materials readers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9664606/","volume":"39","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9664606/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Markov Random Field in Materials Applications: A synoptic view for signal processing and materials readers","sourcePdf":"39msp01-comer-3123564-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051923S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"9664581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","xplore-issue":"9664581","articleId":"9664606","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-31"},{"_id":9664607,"authors":[{"name":"John Edwards","affiliation":["Technology writer, Gilbert, Arizona, USA"],"bio":{"p":["John Edwards (jedwards@johnedwardsmedia.com) is a technology writer based in Gilbert, Arizona, 85234, USA.

The PINNs are supervised with realistic ultrasonic surface acoustic wavefield data acquired at an ultrasonic frequency of 5 MHz for the polycrystalline material. The ultrasonic wavefield data are represented as a deformation on the top surface of the material with the deformation measured using the method of laser vibrometry. The ultrasonic data are further complemented with wavefield data generated using a finite-element-based solver. The neural network is physically informed by the in-plane and out-of-plane elastic wave equations, and its convergence is accelerated using adaptive activation functions. The overarching goal of this work is to infer the spatial variation of compliance coefficients of materials using PINNs, which for ultrasound involves the spatially varying speed of the elastic waves. More broadly, the resulting PINN-based surrogate model shows a promising approach for solving ill-posed inverse problems, often encountered in the nondestructive evaluation of materials.","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2021.3118904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2021.3118904","startPage":"68","endPage":"77","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/79/9664581/09664609.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9664581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Physics-Informed Neural Network for Quantifying the Microstructural Properties of Polycrystalline Nickel Using Ultrasound Data: A promising approach for solving inverse problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","displayDocTitle":"A Physics-Informed Neural Network for Quantifying the Microstructural Properties of Polycrystalline Nickel Using Ultrasound Data: A promising approach for solving inverse problems","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2021","volume":"39","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9664609/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9664609/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Office of Under Secretary of Defense/Air Force Office of Scientific Research Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative","grantNumber":"FA9550-20-1-0358"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000015","fundingName":"U.S. Department of Energy","grantNumber":"DE-SC0019453"},{"fundingName":"Defense University Research Instrumentation Program","grantNumber":"W911-NF-2110089"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Physics-Informed Neural Network for Quantifying the Microstructural Properties of Polycrystalline Nickel Using Ultrasound Data: A promising approach for solving inverse problems","sourcePdf":"39msp01-shukla-3118904-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058783S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"9664581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","xplore-issue":"9664581","articleId":"9664609","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":9664610,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-5888"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0792"}],"articleNumber":"9664610","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":" \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"Presents the front cover for this issue of the publication.","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2021.3110113","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/79/9664581/09664610.pdf","startPage":"C1","endPage":"C1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9664581","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2021.3110113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"[Front cover]","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9664610","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"[Front cover]","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9664610/","volume":"39","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9664610/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"[Front cover]","sourcePdf":"39msp01-cover1-3110113-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.016273S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"9664581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","xplore-issue":"9664581","articleId":"9664610","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":9664611,"authors":[{"name":"Emil Bj\u00f6rnson","affiliation":["Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"bio":{"p":["Emil Bj\u00f6rnson (emilbjo@kth.se) is an associate professor at Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, SE-581 83, Sweden, and a visiting full professor at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden.

With the restriction on bandwidth, processing, and storage, there is an extensive demand for end-to-end video compression. Many conventional methods have been developed to compress video. However, with the extensive use of Artificial Intelligence, AI, such as Deep Learning (DL) have emerged as a best-of-breed alternative for performing different tasks have also been used in the option of improving video compression in the last years, with the primary objective of reducing compression ratio while preserving the same video quality. Evolving video compression research based on Neural Networks (NNs) focuses on two distinct directions: First, enhancing current video codecs by better predictions integrated even in the same codec framework, and second, holistic end-to-end VC systems approach. Although some of the outcomes are optimistic and the results are well, no breakthrough has been reported previously. This paper reviews new research work, including samples of a few influential articles that demonstrate. Further, describe the various highlighted issues in the area of using DL for end-to-end video compression.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9664753","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MTICTI53925.2021.9664790","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference of Modern Trends in Information and Communication Technology Industry (MTICTI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference of Modern Trends in Information and Communication Technology Industry (MTICTI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9664650/9664753/09664790.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doi":"10.1109/MTICTI53925.2021.9664790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Review and Evaluation of End-to-End Video Compression with Deep-Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Review and Evaluation of End-to-End Video Compression with Deep-Learning","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9664790/","publicationDate":"4 Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2022","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9664790/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Review and Evaluation of End-to-End Video Compression with Deep-Learning","confLoc":"Sana'a, Yemen","sourcePdf":"15_paper_56.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.139514S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9664650","isNumber":"9664753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9664650","xplore-issue":"9664753","articleId":"9664790","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9665335,"authors":[{"name":"Amr Elnakeeb","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9675017/9665335/elnak-3139262-small.gif","p":["Amr Elnakeeb (Senior Member, IEEE) received the B.S.

A background subtraction model is extended to include an algebraic variety-based low rank constraint that captures the trajectory. The optimization is solved via the Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares method, adapted to the new signal model. The convergence of the Variety-based Background Subtraction Iterative Reweighted Least Squares (VBSI) algorithm is investigated, where a boundedness analysis is conducted. It is proved that the sequence of estimates generated by VBSI is bounded; furthermore, any limit point of that sequence is a stationary point of the optimization problem. An aggregated error function is shown to converge to zero. A bound on the estimation error is derived that characterizes the relationship between performance and system parameters. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves excellent recovery of the key matrices in both noisy and noiseless scenarios, and typically converges in 20 iterations. Furthermore, a performance improvement of 2.4 dB with regards to the Mean Square Error is observed over prior methods. Finally, the proposed technique is applied to real video data and shown to be effective in estimating non-linear trajectories.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9665335/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 December 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","volume":"70","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","publicationDate":"2022","htmlLink":"/document/9665335/","displayDocTitle":"On Non-Linear Trajectory Tracking via Variety-Based Background Subtraction Models","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ONR","grantNumber":"N00014-15-1-2550 and 503400-78050"},{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-1817200 and CCF-2008927"},{"fundingName":"ARO","grantNumber":"W911NF1910269"},{"fundingName":"Cisco Foundation","grantNumber":"1980393"},{"fundingName":"DOE","grantNumber":"DE-SC0021417"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004359","fundingName":"Vetenskapsr\u00e5det","grantNumber":"2018-04359"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Non-Linear Trajectory Tracking via Variety-Based Background Subtraction Models","sourcePdf":"tsp-elnakeeb-3139262-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080004S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9675017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9675017","articleId":"9665335","onlineDate":"29 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-21"},{"_id":9665358,"authors":[{"name":"Armin Eftekhari","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics, Ume\u00e5 University, Umea, Sweden"],"firstName":"Armin","lastName":"Eftekhari","orcid":"0000-0001-8202-6316"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"9665358","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Over-Parametrized Matrix Factorization in the Presence of Spurious Stationary Points","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9665358","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Optimization","Neural networks","Signal processing algorithms","Signal processing","Training","Toy manufacturing industry"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Rank-constrained matrix factorization","Burer-Monteiro factorization","over-parametrization","interpolation","nonconvex optimization","stationary points"]}],"abstract":"Motivated by the emerging role of interpolating machines in signal processing and machine learning, this work considers the computational aspects of over-parametrized matrix factorization. In this context, the optimization landscape may contain spurious stationary points (SSPs), which are proved to be full-rank matrices. The presence of these SSPs means that it is impossible to hope for any global guarantees in over-parametrized matrix factorization. For example, when initialized at an SSP, the gradient flow will be trapped there forever. Nevertheless, despite these SSPs, we establish in this work that the gradient flow of the corresponding \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">merit function</i>\n converges to a global minimizer, provided that its initialization is rank-deficient and sufficiently close to the \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">feasible set</i>\n of the optimization problem. We numerically observe that a heuristic discretization of the proposed gradient flow, inspired by primal-dual algorithms, is successful when initialized randomly. Our result is in sharp contrast with the local refinement methods which require an initialization close to the \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">optimal set</i>\n of the optimization problem. More specifically, we successfully avoid the traps set by the SSPs because the gradient flow remains rank-deficient at all times, and \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">not</i>\n because there are no SSPs nearby. The latter is the case for the local refinement methods. Moreover, the widely-used restricted isometry property plays no role in our main result.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3139213","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal

Consequently, dynamic spectrum sharing emerges as a promising paradigm of enhancing spectrum usage, which has been widely recognized and adopted in commercial wireless standards, such as the 4G LTE, 5G NR, and so on. As part of 3GPP Release 15, operators allocate portions of the 4G LTE spectrum that they are already using to 5G NR \u2014 this means that 4G LTE and 5G NR users can coexist in the same frequency band/channel at the same time.

This paper analyzes the average secrecy throughput of the system and further investigates two asymptotic scenarios with the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime and the infinite blocklength. In addition, the Fibonacci-based alternating optimization method is adopted to jointly optimize the spectrum sensing blocklength and transmission blocklength to maximize the average secrecy throughput. The numerical results verify the impact of the system parameters on the tradeoff between the spectrum sensing blocklength and transmission blocklength under a secrecy constraint.

Since the frequency-hopping (FH) sequence is usually generated by a certain model with certain regularity, the FH frequency is thus predictable. In this paper, we investigate the FH frequency reconnaissance and prediction of a non-cooperative communication network by effective FH signal detection, time-frequency (TF) analysis, wavelet detection and frequency estimation.

Compared to single-source localization, simultaneously locating multiple sources is more challenging in practice since the association between measurement parameters and source nodes are not known. Moreover, the number of possible measurements-source associations increases exponentially with the number of sensor nodes. It is crucial to discriminate which measurements correspond to the same source before localization. In this work, we propose a centralized localization scheme to estimate the positions of multiple sources. Firstly, we develop two computationally light methods to handle the unknown RSS-AOA measurements-source association problem. One method utilizes linear coordinate conversion to compute the minimum spatial Euclidean distance summation of measurements. Another method exploits the long-short-term memory (LSTM) network to classify the measurement sequences. Then, we propose a weighted least squares (WLS) approach to obtain the closed-form estimation of the positions by linearizing the non-convex localization problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme could gain sufficient localization accuracy under adversarial scenarios where the sources are in close proximity and the measurement noise is strong.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9665366/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 December 2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2021","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","volume":"18","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Passive localization of multiple sources using joint RSS and AOA measurements in spectrum sharing system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passive localization of multiple sources using joint RSS and AOA measurements in spectrum sharing system","sourcePdf":"4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.015014S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","isNumber":"9665359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9665366","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":9665367,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Tang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing 210007, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Tang"},{"name":"Yitao Xu","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing 210007, China"],"firstName":"Yitao","lastName":"Xu"},{"name":"Guofeng Wei","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing 210007, China"],"firstName":"Guofeng","lastName":"Wei"},{"name":"Yang Yang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing 210007, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Yang"},{"name":"Chao Yue","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing 210007, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Yue"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"9665367","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"abstract":"Specific emitter identification can distinguish individual transmitters by analyzing received signals and extracting inherent features of hard-ware circuits. Feature extraction is a key part of traditional machine learning-based methods, but manual extraction is generally limited by prior professional knowledge. At the same time, it has been noted that the performance of most specific emitter identification methods degrades in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments. The deep residual shrinkage network (DRSN) is proposed for specific emitter identification, particularly in the low SNRs. The soft threshold can preserve more key features for the improvement of performance, and an identity shortcut can speed up the training process. We collect signals via the receiver to create a dataset in the actual environments. The DRSN is trained to automatically extract features and implement the classification of transmitters. Experimental results show that DRSN obtains the best accuracy under different SNRs and has less running time, which demonstrates the effectiveness of DRSN in identifying specific emitters.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Integrated circuits","Signal to noise ratio","Radio transmitters","Fingerprint recognition","Transforms","Baseband"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["specific emitter identification","IoT devices","deep learning","soft threshold","deep residual shrinkage networks"]}],"doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.12.005","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9665359/09665367.pdf","startPage":"81","endPage":"93","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9665359","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.12.005","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Specific emitter identification for IoT devices based on deep residual shrinkage networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9665367","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Specific emitter identification for IoT devices based on deep residual shrinkage networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9665367/","volume":"18","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 December 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Specific emitter identification for IoT devices based on deep residual shrinkage networks","sourcePdf":"5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.016828S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","isNumber":"9665359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9665367","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":9665368,"authors":[{"name":"Shilian Zheng","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Communication Information Security Control Laboratory, Jiaxing, 314000, China"],"firstName":"Shilian","lastName":"Zheng"},{"name":"Linhui Ye","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, 310012, China"],"firstName":"Linhui","lastName":"Ye"},{"name":"Xuanye Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, 310012, China"],"firstName":"Xuanye","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Jinyin Chen","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, 310012, China; Institute of Cyberspace Security, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, 310012, China"],"firstName":"Jinyin","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Huaji Zhou","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Communication Information Security Control Laboratory, Jiaxing, 314000, China"],"firstName":"Huaji","lastName":"Zhou"},{"name":"Caiyi Lou","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Communication Information Security Control Laboratory, Jiaxing, 314000, China"],"firstName":"Caiyi","lastName":"Lou"},{"name":"Zhijin Zhao","affiliation":["School of Communication Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, 310018, China"],"firstName":"Zhijin","lastName":"Zhao"},{"name":"Xiaoniu Yang","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Communication Information Security Control Laboratory, Jiaxing, 314000, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoniu","lastName":"Yang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"9665368","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"abstract":"The spectrum sensing model based on deep learning has achieved satisfying detection performence, but its robustness has not been verified.

We design three PUAA methods in black box scenario. In order to defend against PUAA, we propose a defense method based on autoencoder named DeepFilter. We apply the long short-term memory network and the convolutional neural network together to DeepFilter, so that it can extract the temporal and local features of the input signal at the same time to achieve effective defense. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the attack effect of the designed PUAA method and the defense effect of DeepFilter.

The scarcity of spectrum resources is a common problem in both satellite and terrestrial networks. In order to improve resource utilization, the spectrum is shared not only within each component but also between satellite beams and terrestrial cells, which introduces inter-component interferences. To this end, this paper first proposes an analytical framework which considers the inter-component interferences induced by spectrum sharing (SS).

The jamming-assisted spectrum monitoring scheme via spectrum monitoring data (SMD) transmission is proposed to maximize the sum ergodic monitoring rate at SM. In SWPC, the suspicious communications of each data block occupy multiple independent blocks, with a block dedicated to the wireless energy transfer by the energy-constrained suspicious nodes with locations in a same cluster (symmetric scene) or randomly distributed (asymmetric scene) and the remaining blocks used for the information transmission from suspicious transmitters (STs) to suspicious destination (SD). For the symmetric scene, with a given number of blocks for SMD transmission, namely the jamming operation, we first reveal that SM should transmit SMD signal (jam the SD) with tolerable maximum power in the given blocks. The perceived suspicious signal power at SM could be maximized, and thus so does the corresponding sum ergodic monitoring rate. Then, we further reveal one fundamental trade-off in deciding the optimal number of given blocks for SMD transmission. For the asymmetric scene, a low-complexity greedy block selection scheme is proposed to guarantee the optimal performance. Simulation results show that the jamming-assisted spectrum monitoring schemes via SMD transmission achieve much better performance than conventional passive spectrum monitoring, since the proposed schemes can obtain more accurate and effective spectrum characteristic parameters, which provide basic support for fine-grained spectrum management and a solution for spectrum security in dynamic spectrum sharing network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9665370/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 December 2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2021","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","volume":"18","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Proactive spectrum monitoring for suspicious wireless powered communications in dynamic spectrum sharing networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proactive spectrum monitoring for suspicious wireless powered communications in dynamic spectrum sharing networks","sourcePdf":"8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025304S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","isNumber":"9665359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9665370","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":9665371,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaoye Xu","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, Army Engineering University, Nanjing 210007, China"],"firstName":"Zhaoye","lastName":"Xu"},{"name":"Aiyan Qu","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, Army Engineering University, Nanjing 210007, China; Jinling Institute of Technology, Nanjing 211169, China"],"firstName":"Aiyan","lastName":"Qu"},{"name":"Kang An","affiliation":["Sixty-third Research Institute, National University of Defense Technology, Nanjing 210007, China"],"firstName":"Kang","lastName":"An"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"9665371","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Internet of Things","Interference","Array signal processing","Games","Wireless sensor networks","Signal to noise ratio","Quality of service"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["physical layer secure transmission","IoT","coalitional game","alternative optimization method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9665371","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.12.009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.12.009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9665359","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9665359/09665371.pdf","startPage":"139","endPage":"150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coalitional game based joint beamforming and power control for physical layer security enhancement in cognitive IoT networks","abstract":"In this paper, the physical layer secure transmission in multi-antenna multi-user cognitive internet-of-thing (IoT) network is investigated, where the coalitional game based joint beamforming and power control scheme is proposed to improve the achievable security of cognitive IoT devices.

According to different developmental driving forces, in this paper, the evolution of road traffic congestion control is divided into two stages. The ever-growing number of advanced sensing techniques can be seen as the key driving force of the first stage, called the sensing stage, in which congestion control strategies experienced rapid growth owing to the accessibility of traffic data. At the second stage, i.e., the communication stage, communication and computation capability can be regarded as the identifying symbols for this stage, where the ability of collecting finer-grained insight into transportation and mobility reality improves dramatically with advances in vehicular networks, Big Data, and artificial intelligence. Specifically, as the pre-requisite for congestion control, in this paper, existing congestion detection techniques are first elaborated and classified.

Researchers from all over the world have proposed many solutions for indoor positioning over the past several years. However, due to weak signals, multipath or non-line-of-sight signal propagation, accurately and efficiently localizing targets in harsh indoor environments remains a challenging problem. To improve the performance in harsh environment with insufficient anchors, cooperative localization has emerged. In this paper, a novel cooperative localization algorithm, named area optimization and node selection based sum-product algorithm over a wireless network (AN-SPAWN), is described and analyzed. To alleviate the high computational complexity and build optimized cooperative cluster, a node selection method is designed for the cooperative localization algorithm.

The antenna consists of two groups of radiation patches, in 7 layers, and uses the orthogonal adjacent coupling structure on staggered layer to excite a pair of linear polarization modes. Thanks to the staggered feeder mode, it has increased the isolation performance between ports and compressed the transverse size of the antenna. As a result of the combination of staggered stack-up between the patches and the stepped gradient shape of the main radiating patches, it has effectively expanded the impedance bandwidth of the antenna. The proposed antenna is simulated, fabricated and measured. The staggered feeding structure effectively reduces the cross-sectional area of the antenna, and greatly improves the isolation between feeding ports. The measurement results show that the impedance bandwidths for vertical and horizontal polarization modes are 40.2% (638\u2013960 MHz) and 40.0% (645968 MHz) respectively when the return loss is lower than \u221210 dB, and the isolation between feeding ports is better than \u221230 dB.

To further meet the 5G and future 6G communication requirements, this paper proposes a novel direct digital synthesis (DDS) based OFDM transmitter structure that can replace these modules. Due to the strong parallelism of the system structure, it is very suitable for implementation on field programable gate array (FPGA) platform. After making two special simplifications to the primary structure, the refined structure becomes very simple compared with the traditional structures. Most attractively, the proposed structure has the following three advantages that i) the data transformation from frequency domain to time domain has zero latency, ii) the transformation length does not need to be an integer power of 2 and iii) the structure does not even need to use any multiplier, thus leading to low implementation complexity and high speed. Comparative experiments are carried out on Intel FPGA platform which show that our DDS based structure can save more than half of the resources compared with the traditional structures and can provide the same bit error rate (BER) performance under the condition without using any LPSF.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9665359","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.12.014","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9665359/09665396.pdf","startPage":"219","endPage":"229","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.12.014","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel DDS based OFDM transmitter structure without IFFT and interpolation filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Novel DDS based OFDM transmitter structure without IFFT and interpolation filter","volume":"18","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9665396/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel DDS based OFDM transmitter structure without IFFT and interpolation filter","sourcePdf":"14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.015241S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","isNumber":"9665359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9665396","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":9665397,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjun Xu","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing 100876, China"],"firstName":"Wenjun","lastName":"Xu"},{"name":"Wei Chen","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing 100876, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Yongjian Fan","affiliation":["Hebei Key Laboratory of Security and Protection Information Sensing and Processing, Hebei University of Engineering, Handan 056038, China"],"firstName":"Yongjian","lastName":"Fan"},{"name":"Zhi Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing 100876, China"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Xinxin Shi","affiliation":["Beijing Telecom Planning & Designing Institute Co., Ltd., Beijing 100048, China"],"firstName":"Xinxin","lastName":"Shi"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"9665397","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lead","Wireless communication","Resource management","Array signal processing","Performance evaluation","MIMO communication","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["spectrum efficiency","power beacon","WPCN","time splitting","interference channel","wireless power transfer"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9665397","abstract":"We consider a spectrum efficiency (SE) maximization problem for cooperative power beacon-enabled wireless powered communication networks (CPB-WPCNs), where each transmitter harvests energy from multi-antenna power beacons (PBs) and transmits data to the corresponding receiver.

Aiming to improve the system SE, the energy beamformers of PBs, the transmit power, and the transmit time duration of transmitters are jointly optimized. For the TS mode, the original non-convex problem is transformed into a convex optimization problem by means of variable substitution and semidefinite relaxation (SDR). The rank-one nature of this SDR is proved, and then a Lagrange-dual based fast algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal solution with much lower complexity. For the IC mode, to conquer the strong non-convexity of the problem, a branch-reduce-and-bound (BRB) monotonic optimization algorithm is designed as a benchmark. Furthermore, a low-complexity distributed successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm is presented.

In this paper, we consider a wireless UAV-enabled cognitive communication network, where a rotary-wing UAV transmits confidential information to a ground cognitive user over the spectrum assigned to primary users (PUs), while eavesdroppers attempt to wiretap the legitimate transmission. In order to enhance the secrecy performance of wireless communications, the secrecy rate (SR) of the UAV-enabled cognitive communication system is maximized through optimizing UAV three-dimensional (3D) flying trajectory while satisfying the requirements of UAV's initial and final locations and guaranteeing the constraint of maximum speed of UAV and the interference threshold of each PU. However, the formulated SR maximization (SRM) problem is non-convex. For the purpose of dealing with this intractable problem, we employ the difference of two-convex functions approximation approach to convert the non-convex optimization problem into a convex one, which is then solved through applying standard convex optimization techniques. Moreover, an iterative 3D trajectory optimization algorithm for SRM scheme is proposed to achieve the near-optimal 3D trajectory. Simulation results show that our proposed 3D trajectory optimization based SRM algorithm has good convergence, and the proposed SRM scheme outperforms the benchmark approach in terms of the SR performance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9665359","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.12.018","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9665359/09665400.pdf","startPage":"285","endPage":"296","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.12.018","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-dimensional trajectory optimization for secure UAV-enabled cognitive communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Three-dimensional trajectory optimization for secure UAV-enabled cognitive communications","volume":"18","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9665400/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-dimensional trajectory optimization for secure UAV-enabled cognitive communications","sourcePdf":"18.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.014064S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","isNumber":"9665359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9665400","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":9665401,"authors":[{"name":"Zhonghua Zhang","affiliation":["Shenzhen HTI Group Co., Ltd, 518040, Shen Zhen, China"],"firstName":"Zhonghua","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Jie Feng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, School of Telecomm.

In order to ensure the security of VANET, vehicles need to be authenticated before accessing the network. Most existing authentication protocols in VANET adopt the Trusted Authority (TA) with centralized structure which is responsible for the authentication tasks of all vehicles. However, the large-scale network consume a lot of computing resources, which leads to unacceptable delay in message transmission in VANET. For reducing the computational cost of TA, an efficient three-factor privacy-preserving authentication and key agreement protocol was proposed in our paper. Different from before, the RoadSide Unit (RSU) no longer acts as an intermediate node but is responsible for assisting user authentication, which lead to the computational cost of TA is very low. Through formal and informal analysis, our protocol demonstrates excellent security. Compared with previous studies, our work emerges advantages and superiorities in the following aspects: computational cost, communication cost, security properties and functions, message loss ratio, and message delay. These data and evidence indicate that our protocol is an ideal choice for large-scale VANET.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9665359","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.12.020","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9665359/09665402.pdf","startPage":"315","endPage":"331","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.12.020","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient three-factor privacy-preserving authentication and key agreement protocol for vehicular ad-hoc network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","displayDocTitle":"An efficient three-factor privacy-preserving authentication and key agreement protocol for vehicular ad-hoc network","volume":"18","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9665402/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient three-factor privacy-preserving authentication and key agreement protocol for vehicular ad-hoc network","sourcePdf":"20.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027692S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","isNumber":"9665359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9665402","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":9665403,"authors":[{"name":"Liqin Yang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Fudan University, Shanghai 200438, China; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Data Science, Shanghai 200438, China; Institute of Intelligent Electronics and Systems, Shanghai 200438, China; Computer Teaching and Research Section, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China"],"firstName":"Liqin","lastName":"Yang"},{"name":"Guosheng Kang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Fudan University, Shanghai 200438, China; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Data Science, Shanghai 200438, China; Institute of Intelligent Electronics and Systems, Shanghai 200438, China; School of Computer Science and Engineering, Hunan University of Science and Technology, Xiangtan 411201, China"],"firstName":"Guosheng","lastName":"Kang"},{"name":"Liang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Fudan University, Shanghai 200438, China; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Data Science, Shanghai 200438, China; Institute of Intelligent Electronics and Systems, Shanghai 200438, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Zhang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"9665403","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9665403","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Business","Data models","Process control","Task analysis","Process modeling","Time factors","Medical diagnostic imaging"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["business process modeling","medical treatment processes","treatment patterns","clinical practice guidelines"]}],"abstract":"Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are statements relating to evidence-based and economically reasonable medical treatment processes (MTPs) for certain clinical circumstances. The executable MTPs in healthcare information systems can assist the clinical processes. In our previous work, several treatment patterns and their modeling proposals were proposed to reduce the effort spent in modeling MTPs. However, given a CPG document, all the process elements are modeled manually. Besides, business process mining can extract MTP models automatically from execution logs. However, the existing process mining algorithms focus on the control-flow of structured processes. This paper proposes an integrated framework for modeling executable MTPs based on process mining and treatment patterns, taking both the efficiency of mining and the quality of modeling into account. In this framework, an execution log processing approach is presented to identify the subsequences and decision points conforming to the treatment patterns and represent them with abstract activities. Experiments on a synthetic log of the non-secondary hypertension MTP and empirical findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The results show that the process mining in our approach framework can automatically generate more accurate MTP models, and the subprocess models based on treatment patterns make the models easy to understand.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9665359","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.12.021","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9665359/09665403.pdf","startPage":"332","endPage":"349","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.12.021","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Medical treatment process modeling based on process mining and treatment patterns","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Medical treatment process modeling based on process mining and treatment patterns","volume":"18","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9665403/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Medical treatment process modeling based on process mining and treatment patterns","sourcePdf":"21.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.014426S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","isNumber":"9665359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9665403","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":9665404,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"9665404","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9665404","abstract":"Prospective authors are requested to submit new, unpublished manuscripts for inclusion in the upcoming event described in this call for papers.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9665359","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.9665404","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9665359/09665404.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.9665404","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Call for papers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Call for papers","volume":"18","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9665404/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Call for papers","sourcePdf":"cfp.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.018779S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","isNumber":"9665359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9665404","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":9665405,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"9665405","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9665405","abstract":"Presents the back cover for this issue of the publication.","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.9665405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.9665405","startPage":"c4","endPage":"c4","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9665359/09665405.pdf","publicationTitle":"China Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9665359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Back cover","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 December 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Back cover","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2021","volume":"18","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9665405/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Back cover","sourcePdf":"cover2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.013964S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","isNumber":"9665359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9665405","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":9665444,"authors":[{"name":"Jeongho Jeon","affiliation":["Samsung Research America"],"bio":{"p":["Jeongho Jeon [SM] (jeongho.j@samsung.com) received his Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park.

In this article, modular massive multiple-in-put multiple-output (mmMIMO) is presented as one candidate technology for 6G to improve the spectral efficiency in low-frequency bands. The 5G New Radio pushed the boundary of the cellular system's operating frequency to high-frequen-cy bands, and this trend will continue in the 6G era. However, the technical advances in 5G for low-frequency bands fall short, although low-frequency bands are crucial in serving a large number of users in a wide coverage area. Although it would be ideal if massive MIMO could be utilized in low-frequency bands, it is less practical due to a large antenna form factor size. mmMIMO is a technology to distribute a large active antenna array with smaller standardized antenna modules, just like Lego-type building blocks. Through this, the benefits of massive MIMO can be achieved in low-frequency bands (e.g., sub-1 GHz), unconstrained by spatial limitations. In this article, the concept of mmMIMO, its applicability, and needed research efforts to standardize the technology for 6G are discussed. In addition, through the demonstration of a proof-of-concept system, it is shown that the technology can be within reach at the time of 6G commercialization around 2030. Lastly, the performance gain of mmMIMO is evidenced by system-level simulation.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.211.2100164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.211.2100164","startPage":"52","endPage":"58","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/9665418/09665444.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9665418","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Evolution toward 6G: Modular Massive MIMO in Low-Frequency Bands","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2021","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Evolution toward 6G: Modular Massive MIMO in Low-Frequency Bands","publicationDate":"November 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2021","volume":"59","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9665444/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9665444/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Evolution toward 6G: Modular Massive MIMO in Low-Frequency Bands","sourcePdf":"020JEON_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041193S","chronDate":"November  2021","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"9665418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","xplore-issue":"9665418","articleId":"9665444","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2022-01-08"},{"_id":9665459,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Yang","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Yang","id":"37291794500"},{"name":"Siwei Xiang","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Siwei","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37089234549"},{"name":"Jiaxing Wang","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Jiaxing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089233355"},{"name":"Liyan Liang","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Liyan","lastName":"Liang","id":"37089234517"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8281-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9493-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9665459","dbTime":"1 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High Performance and Full Utilization Hardware Implementation of Floating Point Arithmetic Units","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9665459","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System performance","Conferences","Signal processing algorithms","Digital signal processing","Hardware","Computational efficiency","IP networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["floating point arithmetic","mixed precision","Taylor series","pipeline","matrix inversion"]}],"abstract":"Floating point operations are widely used in the fields of communication algorithm, digital signal processing, artificial intelligence and so on. However, the low computation speed and excessive resource consumption have become key limitations on system performance and hardware overhead. Thus, the area efficiency of floating point arithmetic units is important to accelerate computation and reduce resources. This paper presents high performance and area efficient floating point arithmetic units, including adder, multiplier and reciprocal operator. The proposed floating point arithmetic units are evaluated based on a typical scenario of \n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$4\\times 4$</tex>\n matrix inversion in communication.

Error-tolerant applications, such as multimedia processing, machine learning, and signal processing, can process the information with lower-than-standard accuracy at the circuit level while still fulfilling a good and acceptable service quality at the application level. Adaptive filtering-based systems have been demonstrating high resiliency against hardware errors due to their intrinsic self-healing characteristic. This paper investigates the design space exploration of arithmetic approximations in a Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) harmonic elimination (HE) hardware architecture based on Least Mean Square (LMS) adaptive filters. We evaluate the Pareto front of the area- and power versus quality curves by relaxing the arithmetic precision and by adopting both approximate multipliers (AxMs) in combination with approximate adders (AxAs). This paper explores the benefits and impacts of the Dynamic Range Unbiased (DRUM), Rounding-based Approximate (RoBA), and Leading one Bit-based Approximate (LoBA) multipliers in the power dissipation, circuit area, and quality of the VLSI HE architectures. Our results highlight the LoBA 0 as the most efficient AxM applied in the HE architecture. We combine the LoBA 0 with Copy and LOA AxAs with variations in the approximation level (L). Notably, LoBA 0 and LOA with \n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$L=6$</tex>\n resulted in savings of 43.7% in circuit area and 45.2% in power dissipation, compared to the exact HE, which uses multiplier and adder automatically selected by the logic synthesis tool. Finally, we demonstrate that the best hardware architecture found in our investigation successfully eliminates the contaminating spurious noise (i.e., 60 Hz and its harmonics) from the signal.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9665538/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 28 2021-Dec. 1 2021","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2022","publicationDate":"28 Nov. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9665538/","conferenceDate":"28 Nov.-1 Dec. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Boosting the Efficiency of the Harmonics Elimination VLSI Architecture by Arithmetic Approximations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Boosting the Efficiency of the Harmonics Elimination VLSI Architecture by Arithmetic Approximations","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"2186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075448S","chronDate":"Nov. 28 2021-Dec. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9665417","isNumber":"9665446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9665417","xplore-issue":"9665446","articleId":"9665538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":9665637,"authors":[{"name":"Alessio Canepa","affiliation":["University of Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessio","lastName":"Canepa"},{"name":"Edoardo Ragusa","affiliation":["University of Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Edoardo","lastName":"Ragusa"},{"name":"Christian Gianoglio","affiliation":["University of Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Gianoglio"},{"name":"Paolo Gastaldo","affiliation":["University of Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Gastaldo"},{"name":"Rodolfo Zunino","affiliation":["University of Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Rodolfo","lastName":"Zunino"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-8281-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9493-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9665637","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"abstract":"State of the Art solutions for image classification are nowadays mostly based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), With respect to running them for inference, training CNNs is a much more resource demanding job. For this reason, embedded devices designed to execute neural networks are normally not suitable to train the same networks. Hand image classification is becoming increasingly popular in several application areas, by empowering embedded systems with the ability to recognise hand gestures or grasp types. In this field, making it possible to retrain the hand image classifier directly on the embedded device would allow an easy customization of classification task according to application specific needs. In this paper we present a method based on transfer learning which solves this problem by first extracting hand keypoints, using with a dedicated neural network, and then applying on the resulting data a lightweight classifier, easily retrainable directly on the target embedded system. The proposal has been validated on a new freely distributed dataset, outperforming state of the art solutions in the specific task.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Embedded systems","Image recognition","Neural networks","Transfer learning","Real-time systems","Proposals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep Learning","Computer Vision","Grasping","Embedded Systems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICECS53924.2021.9665637","publicationTitle":"2021 28th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 28th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9665417/9665446/09665637.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9665446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS53924.2021.9665637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A pose-based hand image classification method retrainable on embedded target devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9665637","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A pose-based hand image classification method retrainable on embedded target devices","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9665637/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"28 Nov. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9665637/","conferenceDate":"28 Nov.-1 Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2022","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 28 2021-Dec. 1 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A pose-based hand image classification method retrainable on embedded target devices","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"2145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067765S","chronDate":"Nov. 28 2021-Dec. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9665417","isNumber":"9665446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9665417","xplore-issue":"9665446","articleId":"9665637","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9665950,"authors":[{"name":"Jianren Wang","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Jianren","lastName":"Wang","id":"37087079357"},{"name":"Haiming Gang","affiliation":["Honda Research Institute"],"firstName":"Haiming","lastName":"Gang","id":"37086936889"},{"name":"Siddarth Ancha","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Siddarth","lastName":"Ancha","id":"37088691472"},{"name":"Yi-Ting Chen","affiliation":["National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University"],"firstName":"Yi-Ting","lastName":"Chen","id":"37089215369"},{"name":"David Held","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Held","id":"37408101800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2688-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2689-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2475-7888"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2378-3826"}],"articleNumber":"9665950","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Point cloud compression","Three-dimensional displays","Smoothing methods","Detectors","Object detection","Semisupervised learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["semi-supervised learning","3d object detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9665950","doi":"10.1109/3DV53792.2021.00051","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3DV53792.2021.00051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9665818","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9665713/9665818/09665950.pdf","startPage":"413","endPage":"422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-supervised 3D Object Detection via Temporal Graph Neural Networks","abstract":"3D object detection plays an important role in autonomous driving and other robotics applications. However, these detectors usually require training on large amounts of annotated data that is expensive and time-consuming to collect. Instead, we propose leveraging large amounts of unlabeled point cloud videos by semi-supervised learning of 3D object detectors via temporal graph neural networks. Our insight is that temporal smoothing can create more accurate detection results on unlabeled data, and these smoothed detections can then be used to retrain the detector. We learn to perform this temporal reasoning with a graph neural network, where edges represent the relationship between candidate detections in different time frames. After semi-supervised learning, our method achieves state-of-the-art detection performance on the challenging nuScenes [3] and H3D [19] benchmarks, compared to baselines trained on the same amount of labeled data.

The highest-scoring methods are \u201cstructure-based,\u201d and need the query camera\u2019s intrinsics as an input to the model, with careful geometric optimization. When intrinsics are absent, methods vie for accuracy by making various other assumptions. This yields fairly good localization scores, but the models are \u201cnarrow\u201d in some way, e.g., requiring costly test-time computations, or depth sensors, or multiple query frames. In contrast, our proposed method makes few special assumptions, and is fairly lightweight in training and testing.Our pose regression network learns from only relative poses of training scenes. For inference, it builds a graph connecting the query image to training counterparts and uses a graph neural network (GNN) with image representations on nodes and image-pair representations on edges. By efficiently passing messages between them, both representation types are refined to produce a consistent camera pose estimate. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on both standard indoor (7-Scenes) and outdoor (Cambridge Landmarks) camera re-localization benchmarks.

As a consequence, majority of multimedia content is likely to be consumed by machines in the coming years. This opens up new challenges on efficient compression of this type of data. Two main directions are being explored in the literature, one being based on existing traditional codecs, such as the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard, that are optimized for human-targeted use cases, and another based on end-to-end trained neural networks. However, traditional codecs have significant benefits in terms of interoperability, real-time decoding, and availability of hardware implementations over end-to-end learned codecs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose learned post-processing filters that are targeted for enhancing the performance of machine vision tasks for images reconstructed by the VVC codec. The proposed enhancement filters provide significant improvements on the target tasks compared to VVC coded images. The conducted experiments show that the proposed post-processing filters provide about 45% and 49% Bj\u00f8ntegaard Delta Rate gains over VVC in instance segmentation and object detection tasks, respectively.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video coding","Training","Image segmentation","Image coding","Object segmentation","Object detection","Streaming media"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image and video coding for machines","post-processing filter","image compression","perceptual loss","VVC"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISM52913.2021.00046","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9666039/9665797/09666139.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9665797","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISM52913.2021.00046","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learned Enhancement Filters for Image Coding for Machines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9666139","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learned Enhancement Filters for Image Coding for Machines","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9666139/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9666139/","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2022","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2021-Dec. 1 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learned Enhancement Filters for Image Coding for Machines","confLoc":"Naple, Italy","sourcePdf":"373400a235.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096331S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2021-Dec. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9666039","isNumber":"9665797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9666039","xplore-issue":"9665797","articleId":"9666139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9666144,"authors":[{"name":"Maria Santamaria","affiliation":["Tampere University, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Santamaria"},{"name":"Yat-Hong Lam","affiliation":["Tampere University, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Yat-Hong","lastName":"Lam"},{"name":"Francesco Cricri","affiliation":["Nokia Technologies, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Cricri"},{"name":"Jani Lainema","affiliation":["Nokia Technologies, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Jani","lastName":"Lainema"},{"name":"Ramin G.

In-loop filters and postprocessing filters are two types of coding tools that aim to improve the visual quality of the reconstructed content. These tools are usually trained on large video or image datasets with varying content, but they are rarely adaptive to different content types. This problem is addressed with the proposed content-adaptive Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) post-processing filter. The proposed approach is content-adaptive in two ways. Firstly, a relatively simple CNN is pre-trained on a general video dataset and then fine-tuned on the video to be coded.

Thus, detection of model misspecification (MM) is essential in many applications. One of the most prominent MM detection approaches is based on comparison between the empirical characteristic function (CF) and the CF of the assumed model. However, there is no concrete or optimal method to extract the relevant information for MM detection. Another popular approach for MM detection is the information matrix test (IMT), which is based on the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (CRB) regularity condition. This method is insensitive in some basic problems and it requires a twice continuously-differentiable probability density function of the observation under the null hypothesis. In order to address these issues, three new methods for MM detection are proposed in this paper. In the first method, it is proposed to address the CF frequency selection question via an optimization procedure, yielding the optimized characteristic function test (OCFT). In addition, a local version of the OCFT, called the optimized local characteristic function test (OLCFT), which combines information obtained from the CF and information matrix equality, is proposed. This test stems from the generalization of both the CF and the CRB regularity condition. In order to address the differentiabilty limitation, the IMT for MM detection is extended by a finite-difference form, named, discrete IMT (DIMT). Thus, it is applicable for discrete-valued parameters or classification problems. The performances of the proposed methods are studied via several signal processing examples.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3139505","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9675017/09667261.pdf","startPage":"351","endPage":"365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9675017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3139505","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 December 2021","displayDocTitle":"Composite Hypothesis Tests for Detection of Modeling Misspecification","volume":"70","htmlLink":"/document/9667261/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","publicationDate":"2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9667261/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003977","fundingName":"Israel Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2666/19"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Composite Hypothesis Tests for Detection of Modeling Misspecification","sourcePdf":"tsp-tabrikian-3139505-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138884S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9675017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9675017","articleId":"9667261","onlineDate":"31 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-21"},{"_id":9667275,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Learned VC allows end-to-end rate-distortion (R-D) optimized training of nonlinear transform, motion and entropy model simultaneously. Most works on learned VC consider end-to-end optimization of a sequential video codec based on R-D loss averaged over pairs of successive frames. It is well-known in conventional VC that hierarchical, bi-directional coding outperforms sequential compression because of its ability to use both past and future reference frames. This paper proposes a learned hierarchical bi-directional video codec (LHBDC) that combines the benefits of hierarchical motion-compensated prediction and end-to-end optimization. Experimental results show that we achieve the best R-D results that are reported for learned VC schemes to date in both PSNR and MS-SSIM. Compared to conventional video codecs, the R-D performance of our end-to-end optimized codec outperforms those of both x265 and SVT-HEVC encoders (\u201cveryslow\u201d preset) in PSNR and MS-SSIM as well as HM 16.23 reference software in MS-SSIM. We present ablation studies showing performance gains due to proposed novel tools such as learned masking, flow-field subsampling, and temporal flow vector prediction.

A broad family of model-based algorithms have been derived to carry out inference at controllable complexity using recursive computations over the factor graph representing the underlying distribution. An alternative model-agnostic approach utilizes machine learning (ML) methods. Here we propose a framework that combines model-based algorithms and data-driven ML tools for stationary time sequences. In the proposed approach, neural networks are developed to separately learn specific components of a factor graph describing the distribution of the time sequence, rather than the complete inference task. By exploiting stationary properties of this distribution, the resulting approach can be applied to sequences of varying temporal duration. Learned factor graphs can be realized using compact neural networks that are trainable using small training sets, or alternatively, be used to improve upon existing deep inference systems. We present an inference algorithm based on learned stationary factor graphs, which learns to implement the sum-product scheme from labeled data, and can be applied to sequences of different lengths. Our experimental results demonstrate the ability of the proposed learned factor graphs to learn from small training sets to carry out accurate inference for sleep stage detection using the Sleep-EDF dataset, as well as for symbol detection in digital communications with unknown channels.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3139506","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal

The reliability of such accelerators are of utmost importance since any loss in DNN accuracy due to erroneous calculations can have dire consequences. We propose a novel method to measure accuracy losses caused by arbitrary timing faults in systolic arrays. Our GPU-based simulation system enables for the first time a complete and accurate timing simulation of all inference-related matrix operations on large systolic arrays. A single consumer-grade GPU can simulate a LeNet-5 at a throughput of about 13s per inference. Furthermore, our simulation approach readily scales to larger DNNs and multiple GPUs.","doi":"10.1109/ATS52891.2021.00034","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 30th Asian Test Symposium (ATS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 30th Asian Test Symposium (ATS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9667777/9668201/09668210.pdf","startPage":"127","endPage":"132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9668201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATS52891.2021.00034","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Nov. 2021","displayDocTitle":"GPU-Accelerated Timing Simulation of Systolic-Array-Based AI Accelerators","htmlLink":"/document/9668210/","conferenceDate":"22-25 Nov. 2021","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2022","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9668210/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU-Accelerated Timing Simulation of Systolic-Array-Based AI Accelerators","confLoc":"Matsuyama, Ehime, Japan","sourcePdf":"405100a127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061968S","chronDate":"22-25 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9667777","isNumber":"9668201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9667777","xplore-issue":"9668201","articleId":"9668210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":9668685,"authors":[{"name":"Bujin He Shanghai","affiliation":["Shanghai University, University School of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation Shanghai, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Bujin He","lastName":"Shanghai"},{"name":"Wanhe Du Shanghai","affiliation":["School of Intelligent Manufacturing and Control Engineering, shanghai Polytechnic University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wanhe Du","lastName":"Shanghai"},{"name":"Tao Yu","affiliation":["Shanghai University, University School of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation Shanghai, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Yu"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1738-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1739-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9668685","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deformable models","Information science","Service robots","Neural networks","Loading","Error compensation","Production"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BP neural network","industrial robot","positioning accuracy","error compensation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9668685","doi":"10.1109/ISPDS54097.2021.00033","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPDS54097.2021.00033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9668318","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Information Science, Parallel and Distributed Systems (ISPDS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Information Science, Parallel and Distributed Systems (ISPDS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9668312/9668318/09668685.pdf","startPage":"131","endPage":"135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on Positioning Error Compensation of Industrial Robot Based on BP Neural Network","abstract":"Due to the existence of geometric error and non-geometric error factors, the positioning accuracy of industrial robots is greatly reduced, which can not meet the needs of industrial production, so we need to carry out positioning error compensation for industrial robots.

An early diagnosis to enable decisive treatment using a Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system has major challenges, especially accurate detection of different diseases in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. In this paper, a three-step preprocessing is proposed to enhance the quality of MRI images, along with a new Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) architecture for effective diagnosis of glioma, meningioma, and pituitary. The architecture uses batch normalization for fast training with a higher learning rate and ease initialization of the layer weights. The proposed architecture is a computationally lightweight model with a small number of convolutional, max-pooling layers and training iterations. A demonstrative comparison between the proposed architecture and other discussed models in this paper is conducted. An outstanding competitive accuracy is achieved of 98.22% overall, 99% in detecting glioma, 99.13% in detecting meningioma, 97.3% in detecting pituitary and 97.14% in detecting normal images when tested on a dataset with 3394 MRI images. Experimental results prove the robustness of the proposed architecture which has increased the detection accuracy of a variety of brain diseases in a short time.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE
