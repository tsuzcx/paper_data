Since NAND string select devices contain the same charge trap (CT) stack as the memory cells, they are, in principle, programmable. We observe a select threshold voltage increase during cycling of the cell array. This disturb is caused by electron injection from the outermost wordline into the CT layer of the select devices under the erase condition. The increasing select threshold voltage leads to a reduced string current and, finally, to read fails of the NAND string. The mechanism is evaluated by means of electrical measurements and field simulations. Several options to overcome this issue are proposed.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/55/4850262/04850270.pdf","startPage":"568","endPage":"570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Select Device Disturb Phenomenon in TANOS NAND Flash Memories","doi":"10.1109/LED.2009.2017497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4850262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2009.2017497","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4850270","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4850270/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"Select Device Disturb Phenomenon in TANOS NAND Flash Memories","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10624954","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"30","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4850270/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Select Device Disturb Phenomenon in TANOS NAND Flash Memories","sourcePdf":"led-melde-2017497.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049015S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"4850262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4850262","articleId":"4850270","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4850275,"authors":[{"name":"William A.

Model application enables determination of transmit power in terms of a preferred link performance probability. Increasing applications of wireless sensor networks has proportionally increased fielding ideas and platforms. The stability of a platform for a sensor network node cannot always be assumed stable due to physical variation from motion or surface conditions. This creates a time-varying random orientation between nodes in communication with an adjacent partner. A stochastic model is proposed connecting the physical random orientation of a pair of elements to their transmission components. The resulting performance of a link using the proposed model is then applied to achieve reliable communications performance. Analysis demonstrates improved use of network power compared to a method which assigns a blanket power margin across the network.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4850271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2009.4850275","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4814925/4850271/04850275.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2009.4850275","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensor network pair-wise wireless communications performance with unsteady node orientation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"Sensor network pair-wise wireless communications performance with unsteady node orientation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 March-1 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4850275/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10614507","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4850275/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensor network pair-wise wireless communications performance with unsteady node orientation","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"1569170065.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049881S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4814925","isNumber":"4850271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4814925","xplore-issue":"4850271","articleId":"4850275","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4850277,"authors":[{"name":"Yaqin Xie","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, NCRL, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Yaqin Xie","id":"37401613900"},{"name":"Yan Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, NCRL, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Yan Wang","id":"37293648300"},{"name":"Xiaohu You","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, NCRL, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Xiaohu You","id":"37276505600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3381-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3382-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4850277","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":361},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Solid modeling","Closed-form solution","Macrocell networks","Time measurement","Reflection","Maximum likelihood estimation","Scattering","Base stations","Iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","geometry","MIMO communication","mobile radio","nonlinear equations","time-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed-form location estimator","MIMO communication systems","TOA-AOA-AOD measurements","time of arrival","angle of arrival","angle of departure","base station","multiple-input multiple-output systems","nonlinear geometrical equations","mobile station","nonline-of-sight situation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["single reflection","time of arrival (TOA)","angle of arrival (AOA)","angle of departure (AOD)","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","non-line-of-sight (NLOS)"]}],"abstract":"Under the assumption of single reflection of signal, using time of arrival (TOA), angle of arrival (AOA) and angle of departure (AOD) measurements from a single base station (BS) in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, a closed-form solution of the nonlinear geometrical equations for mobile station (MS) location in the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) situation is given.

In particular, signals x(t) that are linear combinations of a finite number of Diracs per unit of time can be acquired by linear filtering followed by uniform sampling. Nevertheless, when the samples are distorted by noise, many of the early proposed schemes can become ill-conditioned. Recently, a stochastic algorithm that recovers the filtered signal z(t) of x(t), but which fails in the reconstruction of x(t) has been presented. In the present paper, a novel stochastic algorithm which blends together concepts of evolutionary algorithms with those of Gibbs sampling and which successes in recovering x(t) is proposed. This algorithm is adapted to the case where the samples are distorted by quantization noise.","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2009.4850282","pdfPath":"/iel5/4814925/4850271/04850282.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2009.4850282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4850271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction of streams of impulses from quantized samples using a stochastic algorithm based on Genetic Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4850282/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction of streams of impulses from quantized samples using a stochastic algorithm based on Genetic Algorithms","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10614511","publicationDate":"March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4850282/","conferenceDate":"30 March-1 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction of streams of impulses from quantized samples using a stochastic algorithm based on Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"1569172451.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062497S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4814925","isNumber":"4850271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4814925","xplore-issue":"4850271","articleId":"4850282","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4850288,"authors":[{"name":"Tsung-Da Hsieh","firstName":"Tsung-Da","lastName":"Hsieh","id":"37692180100"},{"name":"Ming-Xian Chang","firstName":"Ming-Xian","lastName":"Chang","id":"37291155400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3381-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3382-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4850288","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":306},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Signal detection","Time-varying channels","Interference","Chromium","Transceivers","Throughput","Transmitters","Time varying systems","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjacent channel interference","fading channels","interference suppression","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","signal detection","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM signal detection","fast time-varying channels","ICI self-cancellation","decision-directed approaches","interchannel interference","pseudo-pilot detection","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","multipath frequency-selective fading channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","inter-(sub)channel interference (ICI)","pseudo-pilot","signal detection","fading channels"]}],"abstract":"In fast time-varying environments, an OFDM system needs to insert denser pilot symbols among transmitted symbols for tracking the variation of the channel. To reduce the number of pilots, several algorithms including blind, semi-blind, and decision-directed (DD) approaches are proposed. Most of these algorithms assume the channel varies block-wisely, but remain invariant within one OFDM block duration. However, such channel model neglects the inter-(sub)channel interference (ICI) and may be not practical for fast time-varying channels. In this paper, we propose an ICI self-cancellation algorithm under an architecture that could be readily incorporated into an OFDM system that does not take the ICI into consideration. Our algorithm involves only periodic extension and linear combination, and incurs almost no additional complexity. The ICI can be completely removed if the variation of each path in the channel is linear with time during one extended OFDM block. Our algorithm also provides a trade-off between performance and throughput. To validates the proposed algorithm, we incorporate it into an OFDM system with pseudo-pilot (PP) detection. The simulation validates the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, and that neglecting the ICI in fast time-varying channels is impractical.","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2009.4850288","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4814925/4850271/04850288.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2009.4850288","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4850271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of OFDM signals in fast time-varying channels with ICI self-cancellation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4850288","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 1 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4850288/","displayDocTitle":"Detection of OFDM signals in fast time-varying channels with ICI self-cancellation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10614514","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4850288/","conferenceDate":"30 March-1 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of OFDM signals in fast time-varying channels with ICI self-cancellation","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"1569172811.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049059S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4814925","isNumber":"4850271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4814925","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4850271","articleId":"4850288","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4850289,"authors":[{"name":"Jinsuk Baek","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Winston-Salem State University, Winston Salem, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Jinsuk","lastName":"Baek","id":"37399561100"},{"name":"Sun Kyong An","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Winston-Salem State University, Winston Salem, NC, USA"],"lastName":"Sun Kyong An","id":"38194980000"},{"name":"Paul S.

We assume that the spreading waveforms are not orthogonal and hence multiple access interference (MAI) might exist at both the relay nodes as well as the BS. This MAI causes cooperative diversity gain to decrease. To alleviate this problem, the maximum likelihood multiuser detector (MUD) is introduced. We assume that direct and inter-user channel state information (CSI) is present at the BS, and it can use this information to optimally combine received signals from both direct and relay paths. Simulation results show that the proposed maximum likelihood (ML) detector can exploit maximum diversity and also cancel MAI at the BS. However, the complexity of this detector increases exponentially with the number of users. To address this issue, a genetic algorithm (GA) is employed and it will be shown that the proposed detector can achieve a near-optimum bit-error-rate performance with a reasonable complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On multi-user detection in CDMA based cooperative networks","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2009.4850320","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4814925/4850271/04850320.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2009.4850320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4850271","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4850320","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4850320/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"On multi-user detection in CDMA based cooperative networks","conferenceDate":"30 March-1 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4850320/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10588938","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On multi-user detection in CDMA based cooperative networks","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"1569174061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045184S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4814925","isNumber":"4850271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4814925","xplore-issue":"4850271","articleId":"4850320","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4850325,"authors":[{"name":"Atanu Guchhait","affiliation":["Motorola India Research Laboratories, Bangalore, Karnataka, India"],"firstName":"Atanu","lastName":"Guchhait","id":"37297872300"},{"name":"Sivabalan Arumugam","affiliation":["Motorola India Research Laboratories, Bangalore, Karnataka, India"],"firstName":"Sivabalan","lastName":"Arumugam","id":"38196279600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3381-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3382-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4850325","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":307},"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is an effective modulation scheme to improve the performance of a communication system over wireless multipath fading channels.

In this paper we study the effect of local oscillator phase noise in slow time varying channels considering realistic phase noise power spectral density (PSD) function. Carrier to Interference ratio (C/I) expression for individual subcarrier is derived for the additional intercarrier interference (ICI) due to the joint effect of Doppler and phase noise. Realistic phase noise PSD and Jakes Doppler PSD are used to quantify these OFDM system performance metrics. Analytical expression of upper bound on the system performance is obtained. Unlike Gaussian time invariant channels, in time varying channels, OFDM system performance is upper bounded by the ICI due to joint effect of Doppler and phase noise rather than Doppler alone. Numerical and simulation results are included which supports these derived theoretical results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4814925/4850271/04850325.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2009.4850325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2009.4850325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4850271","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4850325","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of joint Doppler, phase noise effects on OFDM systems in time varying channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase noise","Time varying systems","System performance","Interference","OFDM modulation","Communication systems","Wireless communication","Fading","Transceivers","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler shift","fading channels","Gaussian processes","intercarrier interference","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","radiocommunication","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase noise effects","joint Doppler analysis","time varying channels","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","communication system","wireless multipath fading channels","local oscillator phase noise","phase noise power spectral density function","intercarrier interference","Jakes Doppler","Gaussian time invariant channels","transceiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","Phase Noise","OFDM System Performance","Doppler PSD","Time Varying Channel","Inter Carrier Interference","Constant Phase Error","Sub-Carrier to Interference Ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4850325/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of joint Doppler, phase noise effects on OFDM systems in time varying channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4850325/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10614530","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","conferenceDate":"30 March-1 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of joint Doppler, phase noise effects on OFDM systems in time varying channels","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"1569174095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079947S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4814925","isNumber":"4850271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4814925","xplore-issue":"4850271","articleId":"4850325","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4850333,"authors":[{"name":"Ali N.

In this paper, we present a generalized framework for DFT called generalized DFT (GDFT) with nonlinear phase by exploiting the phase space. It is shown that GDFT offers sizable performance improvements over Walsh, Gold and DFT codes in multi-carrier communications scenarios considered. We also highlight that known constant modulus code families are special solutions of the proposed GDFT framework. Moreover, we introduce practical design methods offering computationally efficient implementations for GDFT. We expect performance improvements in future communications systems employing GDFT intelligently.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4814925/4850271/04850333.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2009.4850333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2009.4850333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4850271","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4850333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized discrete Fourier transform: Theory and design methods","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","Design methodology","Fourier transforms","Gold","Space technology","Multiaccess communication","Wireless communication","Communications technology","OFDM modulation","Communication systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized discrete Fourier transform","constant amplitude transforms","nonlinear phase Walsh-like transforms","Gold codes","wire-line communication technologies","wireless communications technologies","code division multiple access","CDMA","discrete multitone","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","nonlinear phase","phase space","multicarrier communications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete Fourier Transform","Generalized Discrete Fourier Transform","OFDM","DMT","Walsh Codes","Gold Codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4850333/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"Generalized discrete Fourier transform: Theory and design methods","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4850333/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10588944","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","conferenceDate":"30 March-1 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized discrete Fourier transform: Theory and design methods","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"1569174175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076934S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4814925","isNumber":"4850271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4814925","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4850271","articleId":"4850333","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4850334,"authors":[{"name":"I-Tai Lu","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Polytechnic Institute of New york University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"firstName":"I-Tai","lastName":"Lu","id":"37297371700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3381-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3382-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4850334","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":367},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","MIMO","Lagrangian functions","Iterative decoding","Bit error rate","Iterative methods","Information rates","Receiving antennas","Interference","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","error statistics","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint MMSE precoder-decoder design","downlink multiuser MIMO systems","arbitrary transmit power constraints","Lagrange multipliers","root searching","BER performance","per-antenna power constraint","per-user power constraints","total power constraints"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Downlink multiuser MIMO","Joint MMSE precoder and decoder","per-antenna power constraint"]}],"abstract":"A novel unified approach to deal with arbitrary transmitted power constraints for designing jointly the MMSE precoders and decoders in downlink multiuser MIMO systems is developed. This work is an extension of the iterative approach developed in (Jinfan Zhang et al., 2005) for the total power constraint. An explicit expression relating Lagrange multipliers with the per-user constraint can be obtained using the proposed approach to mitigate the time consuming root searching for the Lagrange multipliers in (Jinfan Zhang et al., 2005). Moreover, the explicit expression allows the MMSE solution subject to arbitrary transmit power constraints. In this paper, total, per-user, per-antenna, and peak power constraints are formulated in under the same format and solved using the proposed approach. It is shown in some two-user numerical examples that the raw BER performance obtained from the practical per-antenna power constraint is similar to those of the per-user and total power constraints and is 1-1.5 dB better than that of the peak power constraint.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint MMSE precoder and decoder design for downlink multiuser MIMO systems with arbitrary transmit power constraints","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2009.4850334","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4814925/4850271/04850334.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2009.4850334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4850271","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4850334","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4850334/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"Joint MMSE precoder and decoder design for downlink multiuser MIMO systems with arbitrary transmit power constraints","conferenceDate":"30 March-1 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4850334/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10614535","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint MMSE precoder and decoder design for downlink multiuser MIMO systems with arbitrary transmit power constraints","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"1569174181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03951S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4814925","isNumber":"4850271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4814925","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4850271","articleId":"4850334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4850336,"authors":[{"name":"Behtash Babadi","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Behtash","lastName":"Babadi","id":"37391447200"},{"name":"Nicholas Kalouptsidis","affiliation":["Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Nicholas","lastName":"Kalouptsidis","id":"37283182600"},{"name":"Vahid Tarokh","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Tarokh","id":"37271249900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3381-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3382-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4850336","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":330},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonance light scattering","Filtering algorithms","Adaptive filters","Signal processing algorithms","Least squares approximation","Computational complexity","Least squares methods","State estimation","Signal processing","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","computational complexity","expectation-maximisation algorithm","least mean squares methods","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SPARLS algorithms","RLS algorithms","adaptive filtering","low complexity recursive regularized least square algorithm","sparse signal estimation","expectation-maximization type algorithm","online estimation","multipath wireless channels","mean squared error algorithm","computational complexity"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we overview the low complexity recursive L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-Regularized Least Squares (SPARLS) algorithm proposed in [2], for the estimation of sparse signals in an adaptive filtering setting.

The differential IR UWB systems have been extensively discussed recently. The advantage of differential IR UWB systems include simple receiver frontend structure. One challenge in the demodulation and equalization of such systems with ISI is that the systems have a rather complex model. The input and output signals of the systems follow a second-order Volterra model. Furthermore, the noise at the output is data dependent. In this paper, we propose a reduced-complexity joint demodulation and equalization algorithm. The algorithm is based on reformulating the nearest neighborhood decoding problem into a mixed quadratic programming and utilizing a semi-definite relaxation. The numerical results show that the proposed demodulation and equalization algorithm has low computational complexity, and at the same time, has almost the same error probability performance compared with the maximal likelihood decoding algorithm.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4850271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2009.4850340","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4814925/4850271/04850340.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2009.4850340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced complexity demodulation and equalization scheme for differential Impulse Radio UWB Systems with ISI","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"Reduced complexity demodulation and equalization scheme for differential Impulse Radio UWB Systems with ISI","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 March-1 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4850340/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10588947","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4850340/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced complexity demodulation and equalization scheme for differential Impulse Radio UWB Systems with ISI","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ","sourcePdf":"1569174547.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061592S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4814925","isNumber":"4850271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4814925","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4850271","articleId":"4850340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4850342,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Elalem","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Ryerson University, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Elalem","id":"37974677100"},{"name":"Lian Zhao","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Ryerson University, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Lian","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37279828100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3381-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3382-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4850342","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":254},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Interference","Performance analysis","Mobile computing","Computer networks","Distributed computing","Wireless networks","Antenna arrays","Scattering","Multimedia systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel capacity","code division multiple access","mobile communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WCDMA mobile network","high-capacity wireless networks","interference-limited capacity","realistic user distribution"]}],"abstract":"WCDMA is becoming widely accepted as one of the most promising solutions to meet the increasing demand for high-capacity wireless networks of the future.

This paper presents a study of the effect of a selected user distribution on the performance of a WCDMA cellular system. A more realistic user distribution is chosen with specific parameters and a new interference distribution factor is developed as a function of these parameters.

However, it is often neglected that the power gain provided by directional antennas can compensate for the deleterious effect of their limited beamwidth. In this paper, we analyze the efficiency of directional antennas to investigate whether these antennas can improve the capacity of MIMO communication systems versus commonly used omnidirectional antennas. Employing a realistic MIMO channel model, we show that the performance of directional antennas depends on the scattering environment, the signal to noise ratio and the array configuration.

The discrete bit loading algorithms are proposed, which minimize the mean BER of the system for a target bit rate under a peak power constraint. The results are shown for a power line communication system using a well-known multipath channel model. The other, more common, robustness optimization problem is the margin maximization. The obtained results are compared with those of the margin maximization for both OFDM and LP-OFDM schemes.

Moreover, it is observed that the LP-OFDM allocations have lower computational complexity than the OFDM allocations.","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2009.4850349","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4814925/4850271/04850349.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2009.4850349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4850271","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mean BER minimization loading algorithm for linear precoded OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4850349","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mean BER minimization loading algorithm for linear precoded OFDM","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 1 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4850349/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 March-1 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10614542","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4850349/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mean BER minimization loading algorithm for linear precoded OFDM","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"1569175475.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072924S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 1 2009","isNumber":"4850271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4814925","articleId":"4850349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4850357,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Cotae","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of District of Columbia, Washington D.C., DC, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Cotae","id":"37274573000"},{"name":"Fatou Diop Mbengue","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of District of Columbia, Washington D.C., DC, USA"],"firstName":"Fatou Diop","lastName":"Mbengue","id":"38193766600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3381-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3382-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4850357","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":76},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Multiaccess communication","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Covariance matrix","Fading","Radio transmitters","Algorithm design and analysis","Power system modeling","Bandwidth","Design engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","fading channels","multipath channels","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power efficient resource allocation","overloaded multipath DS-CDMA systems","Gaussian vector channel","water filling principle","inverse eigenvalue problem","p-norm matrices","multipath fading","direct sequence code division multiple access"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["water-filing principle","inverse eigenvalue problem","capacity maximization","multipath","overloaded CDMA systems"]}],"abstract":"A comparison of the optimal power allocation for a Gaussian vector channel subject to sum power constraint under water filling principle and inverse eigenvalue problem is given.

Shaping the spectrum of OFDM-based CR is needed to reduce the out-of-band radiations and reduce the interference delivered to the licensed user (LU). In this paper, shaping the spectrum using windowing and active cancellation carriers is discussed. It is shown that the use of windowing alone for large band is a better choice. The window choice in case of large number of subcarriers spanned by a LU is investigated and it is shown that the Hanning window outperforms the raised cosine window by 7 dB. Computational complexity analysis is introduced and it shows a huge advantage by using windowing alone for large frequency bands and multiple bands vis-a-vis cancellation carriers. Simulations show that such technique offers no effect on the bit error rate performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4814925/4850271/04850359.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2009.4850359","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2009.4850359","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4850271","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4850359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Revisiting active cancellation carriers for shaping the spectrum of OFDM-based Cognitive Radios","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","OFDM","Chromium","Interference","Wireless communication","Computational complexity","Bit error rate","FCC","Bandwidth","Band pass filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","computational complexity","error statistics","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active cancellation carriers","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","cognitive radios","licensed user","Hanning window","bit error rate","computational complexity analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4850359/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"Revisiting active cancellation carriers for shaping the spectrum of OFDM-based Cognitive Radios","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4850359/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10588959","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","conferenceDate":"30 March-1 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Revisiting active cancellation carriers for shaping the spectrum of OFDM-based Cognitive Radios","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"1569175681.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037063S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4814925","isNumber":"4850271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4814925","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4850271","articleId":"4850359","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4850369,"authors":[{"name":"Ka Mun Ho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Rutgers, State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Ka Mun","lastName":"Ho","id":"38560277100"},{"name":"Canute Vaz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Rutgers, State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Canute","lastName":"Vaz","id":"38262177600"},{"name":"David G.

The communications signals considered are Binary Amplitude Shift Keyed (BASK), Binary Frequency Shift Keyed (BFSK), and Binary Phase Shift Keyed (BPSK) signals, which are transmitted over an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel having a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in the range from -5 dB to 10 dB. The distinguishing features of these three modulation schemes arise due to variations of amplitude, frequency and phase of a carrier signal. The different types of binary communications signals are analyzed using the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). The unique features of each modulation type are extracted from the specific wavelet-domain representation of the respective signals. The features are stored as templates within the receiver and used for the purpose of classifying the signal according to modulation type. The wavelet used for template construction and the decomposition of received signals is the Reverse Biorthogonal Spline 1.3 (rbio1.3) wavelet. It has been determined via extensive computer simulations that the rate of correct classification for BASK signals is 100% and for BPSK signals is 99.7% over the range of SNR values considered. The rates of correct classification for BFSK signals are 99.6%, 98.7%, 94.0%, and 54.0% for SNR = 10 dB, 5 dB, 0 dB, and -5 dB, respectively. The AMR process presented in this study generally produces higher rates of correct classification than other AMR techniques available in the literature. This observation is especially significant when considering the cases of BASK and BPSK for systems operating at an SNR value of -5 dB.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2009.4850369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4850271","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4814925/4850271/04850369.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wavelet-based method for classification of binary digitally modulated signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4850369/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 1 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4850369/","displayDocTitle":"A wavelet-based method for classification of binary digitally modulated signals","conferenceDate":"30 March-1 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10588966","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wavelet-based method for classification of binary digitally modulated signals","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"1569175795.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05087S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4814925","isNumber":"4850271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4814925","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4850271","articleId":"4850369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4850375,"authors":[{"name":"Edward I.

Fiber-optic retrieval of an RF signal can be achieved by down-converting and digitizing the signal for conveyance by a digital fiber-optic link, or it can be achieved by conveying the RF signal over an analog fiber-optic link before digitization. The latter approach can be realized with a minimum of hardware and dc power required at the sensing site, provided that the analog fiber-optic link has a sufficiently low noise figure without a pre-amplifier. Early demonstrations of ldquoamplifierlessrdquo analog fiber-optic links typically reported very high noise figures-in excess of 30 dB. In the last decade or so, several techniques have been developed to improve this situation. We describe five such techniques and show that they have resulted in much lower measured noise figures for amplifierless links. One technique, for example, has yielded noise figures < 5 dB for amplifierless links at frequencies of up to 10 GHz. The existence of amplifierless links with such low noise figures may enable remote sensing of signals in situations where the size, weight, and power (SWAP) of the remote hardware is of primary concern.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4850271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2009.4850375","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4814925/4850271/04850375.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2009.4850375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-noise-figure photonic links without pre-amplification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2009-April 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"Low-noise-figure photonic links without pre-amplification","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 March-1 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4850375/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10614550","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4850375/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-noise-figure photonic links without pre-amplification","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"1569196627.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042806S","chronDate":"March 30 2009-April 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4814925","isNumber":"4850271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4814925","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4850271","articleId":"4850375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4850382,"authors":[{"name":"Paul L.

If a class change is detected, then change detection has been accomplished. The ANN is presented as well as experimental results usingMODIS time-series data derived from 8-day 500m MODIS [MOD09] composite images in two study areas in Southern Africa. The method is supervised, i.e. it assumes training data is available, but after training it is able to detect change on testing data not seen before.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4851314/","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4851314/","publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2009","conferenceDate":"7-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Detection of Land Cover Change Using an Artificial Neural Network Within a Temporal Sliding Windowon Modis Time Series Data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Land Cover Change Using an Artificial Neural Network Within a Temporal Sliding Windowon Modis Time Series Data","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"0401422.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054029S","chronDate":"7-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757194","isNumber":"4779630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757194","xplore-issue":"4779630","articleId":"4851314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"}]
