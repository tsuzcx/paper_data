The algorithm, which is based on balanced realization, can be used for reducing the order of circuits before circuit-level simulation. In contrast to Pade-based algorithms which match the reduced order system with original system in some given frequencies, balanced realization based model algorithms provide a nearly optimal matching over all frequencies. Hence the balanced realization method produces stable and more accurate results compared to the Pade-based algorithms for model reduction. In addition given an upper bound for error, it is possible to compute the minimum degree for the reduced order model a priori.

Efficient analysis of the effects of parameter variations (cache dimensions, degree of associativity, replacement policy, line size, ...) is at the same time an essential and very time-consuming aspect of embedded system design, whose complexity increases when multi-tasking and real-time aspects must be considered. We propose a new simulation-based methodology, focused on an approximate model of the cache and of the multi-tasking reactive software, that allows one to trade off smoothly between accuracy and simulation speed. In particular, we propose to accurately consider intra-task conflicts, but approximate inter-task conflicts by considering only a finite number of previous task executions. The rationale for this choice can be found in a common pattern in embedded systems, where a \"normal\" data flow results in a regular intra-task common flow, interrupted from time to time by some urgent event, that pessimistically can be consider as disrupting the cache behavior. The approach is conservative because re-execution of a task after a large amount of time will always be considered as not in cache, and the simulation speed-up is considerable, as shown by theoretical analysis and experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.1999.760030","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the ASP-DAC '99 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference 1999 (Cat.

The analysis considers single and three-phase uncontrolled rectifiers with continuous and discontinuous evolution of the AC current. It leads to four possible situations which fit with the harmonic behaviour of discharge lamps, arc furnaces and rectifiers with capacitive DC smoothing. A very useful set of compact and powerful analytical expressions for different magnitudes as well as for the harmonics currents are derived. It offers a direct method of selecting different operating points with their corresponding harmonic emissions. Normalized diagrams and tables of these magnitudes are depicted in a friendly way. Over these diagrams, harmonic emission limits of standard IEC 1000-3-2 and IEC 1000-3-4 are specified for Class C and Class D single-phase equipment and for three-phase equipment. Passive solutions applied to the aforementioned rectifiers to comply IEC 1000-3-2 and 1000-3-4 are obtained in a direct and normalized way.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHQP.1998.760136","publicationTitle":"8th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power.

The results of the offline tests indicate that the FNN has very high estimation accuracy. It has a recursive nature that makes it a candidate for real-time measurements. It also gave good results in a noisy environment where SNR is as low as 10 dB. The FNN model was implemented on a PC using a data acquisition board. The system was used for an online harmonic estimation study. The FNN was able to estimate the harmonic components of voltage and current at various levels. The estimation results were compared with the data obtained using a FLUKE 41 harmonics meter. The comparison revealed that the ANN based harmonic estimation model performs similarly to industrial-approved meters.","doi":"10.1109/ICHQP.1998.760178","pdfPath":"/iel4/6146/16440/00760178.pdf","startPage":"999","endPage":"1009 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"8th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power.

Based on representing color data by the quaternions, the statistical parameters of color data can be expressed through the definition of quaternion moments. Analytical formulas of the BQMP thresholding can thus be determined by using the algebra of the quaternions. The computation time for the BQMP thresholding is of order of the data size. By using the BQMP thresholding, quaternion-moment-based operators are designed for the application of color image processing, such as color image compression, multiclass clustering of color data, and subpixel color edge detection. The experimental results show that the proposed operator for color image compression can have output picture quality acceptable to human eyes. In addition, the proposed edge operator can detect the color edge at the subpixel level. Therefore, the proposed BQMP thresholding can be used as a tool for color image processing.","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/16446/00760310.pdf","startPage":"614","endPage":"628","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.760310","doi":"10.1109/83.760310","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=760310","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Color","Image coding","Image edge detection","Quaternions","Multidimensional systems","Algebra","Humans","Eyes","Image processing","Transform coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","data compression","edge detection","image colour analysis","image representation","statistical analysis","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["color image processing","binary quaternion-moment-preserving thresholding technique","BQMP thresholding","statistical parameters","computation time","data size","color image compression","multiclass clustering","subpixel color edge detection","output picture quality","edge operator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/760310/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","displayDocTitle":"Color image processing by using binary quaternion-moment-preserving thresholding technique","accessionNumber":"6249809","pubMedId":"18267478","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1999","volume":"8","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Color image processing by using binary quaternion-moment-preserving thresholding technique","sourcePdf":"00760310.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03282S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"104","articleId":"760310","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":760311,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The most advanced tools use deep-ultraviolet (DUV) radiation having a wavelength of 248 nm and are used to print 250-nm features. These tools will likely be extended for use at the 180-nm generation and perhaps below. New DUV tools using 193-nm radiation are actively under development and are expected to be used for 130-nm generation and perhaps even 100-nm generation. Extending these DUV optical projection tools for manufacturing in the 100-200-nm region will be paced by the development of new high numerical aperture imaging systems and highly complex phase shift masks. For future generations of integrated circuits with minimum feature sizes below 100 nm, 193-nm tools will have great difficulty meeting all manufacturing requirements. This paper describes an alternate optical approach, for sub-100-nm generations, based on extreme ultraviolet radiation at around 13 nm, called extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL). This approach uses a laser-produced plasma source of radiation, a reflective mask, and a 4/spl times/ reduction all-reflective imaging system. The technology is currently in the engineering development phase for an alpha machine. This paper reviews its current status and describes the basic modules or building blocks of a generic EUVL exposure tool.","doi":"10.1109/3.760315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16452","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.760315","endPage":"699","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel4/3/16452/00760315.pdf","startPage":"694","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extreme ultraviolet lithography","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/760315/","displayDocTitle":"Extreme ultraviolet lithography","volume":"35","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"6248213","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extreme ultraviolet lithography","sourcePdf":"00760315.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048801S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"137","articleId":"760315","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":760317,"authors":[{"name":"D.T.

Typically, 1-10 W are radiated within a 1/N relative spectral bandwidth, where N is of order 100. Monochromators are frequently used to narrow the spectral bandwidth and increase the longitudinal coherence length, albeit with a more than proportionate loss of power. Pinhole spatial filtering is employed to provide spatially coherent radiation at a power level determined by the wavelength, electron beam, and undulator parameters. In this paper, experiments are described in which broadly tunable, spatially coherent power is generated at EUV and soft X-ray wavelengths extending from about 3 to 16 nm (80-430-eV photon energies). Spatially coherent power of order 10 /spl mu/W is achieved in a relative spectral bandwidth of 9/spl times/10/sup -4/, with 1.90-GeV electrons traversing an 8-cm period undulator of 55 periods. This radiation has been used in 13.4-nm interferometric tests that achieve an rms wavefront error (departure from sphericity) of /spl lambda//sub euv//330. These techniques scale in a straightforward manner to shorter soft X-ray wavelengths using 4-5-cm period undulators at 1.90 GeV and to X-ray wavelengths of order 0.1 nm using higher energy (6-8 GeV) electron beams at other facilities.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel4/3/16452/00760317.pdf","startPage":"709","endPage":"720","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/3.760317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.760317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16452","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=760317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tunable coherent radiation in the soft X-ray and extreme ultraviolet spectral regions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Undulators","Ultraviolet sources","Bandwidth","Spatial coherence","Electromagnetic radiation","Electron beams","Periodic structures","Electromagnetic spectrum","Power filters","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["undulator radiation","wigglers","X-ray production","tuning","brightness","X-ray monochromators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tunable coherent radiation","soft X-ray spectral region","EUV spectral region","undulator radiation","relativistic electrons","periodic magnet structure","continuously tunable source","very bright partially coherent radiation","soft X-ray","relative spectral bandwidth","longitudinal coherence length","pinhole spatial filtering","undulator parameters","GeV electrons","undulator","interferometric tests","3 to 16 nm","10 muW","1.9 GeV","6 to 8 GeV"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/760317/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","displayDocTitle":"Tunable coherent radiation in the soft X-ray and extreme ultraviolet spectral regions","volume":"35","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6248215","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tunable coherent radiation in the soft X-ray and extreme ultraviolet spectral regions","sourcePdf":"00760317.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034614S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"35","articleId":"760317","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":760325,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Attention is focused on the reconstruction of the two-dimensional (2-D) image of an object obtained by processing complex samples of the continuous wave (CW) signal return received for different object aspect angles covering a 2/spl pi/ total variation. The effects of a polar sampling of the Fourier transform (FT) of the target reflectivity function on the impulse response of the imaging system are analyzed. A criterion for the choice of the angular sampling interval in order to control the image blurring is given. Finally, a new and fast digital signal processing method for image reconstruction is proposed. This method reconstructs high resolution images of rotating targets illuminated by a CW electromagnetic signal or by a large bandwidth transmitted signal. This algorithm is suitable for processing wideband received signal of targets observed for a large variation of the viewing angle, so it is very attractive for the reconstruction of very high spatial resolution target images in SAR/ISAR systems. To show the performance of the method we finally present and discuss the results obtained by applying the proposed technique on simulated and experimental data.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Microwave theory and techniques","Digital signal processing","Signal processing","Image sampling","Signal sampling","Spatial resolution","Microwave imaging","Two dimensional displays","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave imaging","image reconstruction","image sampling","Fourier transforms","synthetic aperture radar","inverse problems","radar imaging","radar resolution","CW radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high resolution images","2D microwave image reconstruction","rotating objects","microwave imaging","digital signal processing","complex samples","continuous wave signal return","object aspect angles","polar sampling","Fourier transform","target reflectivity function","impulse response","imaging system","angular sampling interval","image blurring control","fast DSP method","rotating targets","CW electromagnetic signal","large bandwidth transmitted signal","wideband received signal","viewing angle variation","SAR/ISAR systems","experimental data","simulated data"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.760335","startPage":"679","endPage":"687","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/16446/00760335.pdf","doi":"10.1109/83.760335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new fast method for the reconstruction of 2-D microwave images of rotating objects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","displayDocTitle":"A new fast method for the reconstruction of 2-D microwave images of rotating objects","accessionNumber":"6249814","pubMedId":"18267483","publicationDate":"May 1999","volume":"8","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/760335/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new fast method for the reconstruction of 2-D microwave images of rotating objects","sourcePdf":"00760335.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025839S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"14","articleId":"760335","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":760336,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

Diagonal preconditioners offer some improvement in convergence rate, but do not incorporate the structure of the Hessian matrices in imaging problems. Circulant preconditioners can provide remarkable acceleration for inverse problems that are approximately shift-invariant, i.e., for those with approximately block-Toeplitz or block-circulant Hessians. However, in applications with nonuniform noise variance, such as arises from Poisson statistics in emission tomography and in quantum-limited optical imaging, the Hessian of the weighted least-squares objective function is quite shift-variant, and circulant preconditioners perform poorly. Additional shift-variance is caused by edge-preserving regularization methods based on nonquadratic penalty functions. This paper describes new preconditioners that approximate more accurately the Hessian matrices of shift-variant imaging problems. Compared to diagonal or circulant preconditioning, the new preconditioners lead to significantly faster convergence rates for the unconstrained conjugate-gradient (CG) iteration. We also propose a new efficient method for the line-search step required by CG methods. Applications to positron emission tomography (PET) illustrate the method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/760336/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","volume":"8","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6249815","pubMedId":"18267484","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Conjugate-gradient preconditioning methods for shift-variant PET image reconstruction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conjugate-gradient preconditioning methods for shift-variant PET image reconstruction","sourcePdf":"00760336.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034519S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"158","articleId":"760336","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":760338,"authors":[{"name":"A.P.

This model is largely based on a previously proposed model, but has a number of modifications that make it more amenable to potential integration into a wavelet based image compression scheme. These modifications include the use of a separable wavelet transform instead of the cortex transform, the application of a wavelet contrast sensitivity function (CSF), and a simplified definition of subband contrast that allows one to predict the noise visibility directly from the wavelet coefficients. Initially, we outline the luminance, frequency, and masking sensitivities of the HVS and discuss how these can be incorporated into the wavelet transform. We then outline a number of limitations of the wavelet transform as a model of the HVS, namely the lack of translational invariance and poor orientation sensitivity. In order to investigate the efficacy of this wavelet based model, a wavelet visible difference predictor (WVDP) is described. The WVDP is then used to predict visible differences between an original and compressed (or noisy) image. Results are presented to emphasize the limitations of commonly used measures of image quality and to demonstrate the performance of the WVDP. The paper concludes with suggestions on how the WVDP can be used to determine a visually optimal quantization strategy for wavelet coefficients and produce a quantitative measure of image quality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/760338/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","publicationDate":"May 1999","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6249817","pubMedId":"18267486","volume":"8","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A wavelet visible difference predictor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wavelet visible difference predictor","sourcePdf":"00760338.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055926S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"98","articleId":"760338","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-16"},{"_id":760342,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A key feature of our approach is that it incorporates appropriate physical models to cope with the task dynamics in the motion planning paradigm. The planner is based on a two-level scheme. The high level considers a simplified two-dimensional instance of the motion task and searches a subset of the configuration space of the robot in order to generate nominal subgoals through which the robot is steered. The local level solves for continuous feasible trajectories and actuator controls to move the robot between neighboring subgoals in the presence of the entire task constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implemented planner that solves for feasible trajectories to be performed by a wheeled vehicle on quite complex terrains.

Contrary to the position-based visual servoing, our scheme does not need any geometric three-dimensional model of the object. Furthermore and contrary to image-based visual servoing, our approach ensures the convergence of the control law in the whole task space. 2 1/2 D visual servoing is based on the estimation of the partial camera displacement from the current to the desired camera poses at each iteration of the control law. Visual features and data extracted from the partial displacement allow us to design a decoupled control law controlling the six camera DOFs. The robustness of our visual servoing scheme with respect to camera calibration errors is also analyzed: the necessary and sufficient conditions for local asymptotic stability are easily obtained. Then, due to the simple structure of the system, sufficient conditions for global asymptotic stability are established. Finally, experimental results with an eye-in-hand robotic system confirm the improvement in the stability and convergence domain of the 2 1/2 D visual servoing with respect to classical position-based and image-based visual servoing.","doi":"10.1109/70.760345","startPage":"238","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/16447/00760345.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.760345","endPage":"250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2 1/2 D visual servoing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/760345/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","displayDocTitle":"2 1/2 D visual servoing","volume":"15","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6243647","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2 1/2 D visual servoing","sourcePdf":"00760345.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041231S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"691","articleId":"760345","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":760351,"authors":[{"name":"Y.H.

It is shown that all the signals in a closed-loop system composed of a robot, an observer, and a controller is uniformly ultimately bounded. This amounts to a separation principle for the design of nonlinear dynamic trackers for robotic systems. The neural network weights in both the observer and the controller are tuned online, with no off-line learning phase required. No exact knowledge of the robot dynamics is required so that the neural network controller is model-free and so applicable to a class of nonlinear systems which have a similar structure to robot manipulators.

Each joint controller consists of three nonlinear integral terms in the tracking error. Global asymptotic stability of tracking errors is established using the Lyapunov stability theory. The control system is shown to be robust to torque disturbances affecting the system and to a class of unmodeled dynamics. To further improve the robustness of the closed-loop system in situations where measurement noise is present, a simple modification to the controller is proposed. It is shown that exponential convergence of the error to arbitrarily small values is guaranteed with this modification. A systematic procedure for the selection of controller parameters is provided, and simulations results using the complete dynamic model of a six degree of freedom industrial robot are presented to demonstrate the excellent tracking performance of the proposed controller.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/760360/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6243660","volume":"15","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Decoupled nonlinear three-term controllers for robot trajectory tracking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoupled nonlinear three-term controllers for robot trajectory tracking","sourcePdf":"00760360.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037635S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"16","articleId":"760360","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":760361,"authors":[{"name":"R.

A common read-out scheme sensing the differential voltage of dual-rail bit lines is used. The hardware was fabricated in a 0.25-/spl mu/m drawn channel length, six-metal-layer (Al) CMOS technology (1.8-V nominal VDD). Wafer testing was performed using a probe card. The macros were tested cycle by cycle by scanning the input data to the read/write address latches and data latches, and scanning the result out from the output receiving latches. Functional testing was performed on guTS macros at frequencies up to 1.0 GHz at 25/spl deg/C with nominal VDD (1.1 GHz for the ROM).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/760371/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6248059","volume":"34","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A 1-GHz logic circuit family with sense amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1-GHz logic circuit family with sense amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00760371.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05125S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"6","articleId":"760371","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":760373,"authors":[{"name":"B.W.

Therefore, V/sub ref/ is about 1.25 V, which limits a low supply-voltage operation below 1 V. Conversely, in the proposed BGR circuit, V/sub ref/ has been converted from the sum of two currents; one is proportional to V/sub f/ and the other is proportional to V/sub T/. An experimental BGR circuit, which is simply composed of a CMOS op-amp, diodes, and resistors, has been fabricated in a conventional 0.4-/spl mu/m flash memory process.

This architecture realizes highly scalable, excellently noise-immune, and highly reliable NAND flash memories. The program disturbance that limits the scaling of a local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS) width in a conventional NAND-type cell is drastically reduced. As a result, the scaling limit of the LOCOS width decreases from 0.56 to 0.45 /spl mu/m, which leads to 20% isolation width reduction. The proposed cell is essential for the future scaled shallow trench isolated cells because improved program disturb characteristics can be obtained irrespective of the process technology or feature size. New circuit techniques, such as a PMOS drive column latch and a V/sub cc/-bit-line shield sensing method are also utilized to realize the proposed cell operation. By using these novel circuit technologies, array noise, such as a source-line noise and an inter bit line capacitive coupling noise, are eliminated. Consequently, the V/sub th/ fluctuation due to array noise is reduced from 0.7 to 0.1 V, and the V/sub th/ distribution width decreases from 1.2 to 0.6 V. In addition to the smaller cell size and the high noise immunity, the proposed cell improves device reliability. The read disturb time increases by more than three orders of magnitude, and a highly reliable operation can be realized.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit noise","Leakage current","Oxidation","Silicon","Isolation technology","Noise reduction","Flash memory","Digital cameras","Energy consumption","Tunneling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memory architecture","NAND circuits","flash memories","isolation technology","oxidation","integrated circuit noise","integrated circuit reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["negative V/sub th/ cell architecture","NAND flash memories","programmed state","erased state","program disturbance","local oxidation","scaling limit","scaled shallow trench isolated cells","program disturb characteristics","process technology","PMOS drive column latch","V/sub cc/-bit-line shield sensing method","array noise","source-line noise","inter bit line capacitive coupling noise","cell size","noise immunity","device reliability","highly reliable operation","0.45 micron","0.1 V","0.6 V"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=760379","doi":"10.1109/4.760379","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel4/4/16453/00760379.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.760379","startPage":"675","endPage":"684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16453","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A negative V/sub th/ cell architecture for highly scalable, excellently noise-immune, and highly reliable NAND flash memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A negative V/sub th/ cell architecture for highly scalable, excellently noise-immune, and highly reliable NAND flash memories","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/760379/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","volume":"34","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6248066","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A negative V/sub th/ cell architecture for highly scalable, excellently noise-immune, and highly reliable NAND flash memories","sourcePdf":"00760379.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038619S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"22","articleId":"760379","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":760380,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The chip has a measured power dissipation of 4.65 mW at 1.3 V and 14 MHz, which meets the sample rate requirements for MPEG-2 MP@ML.

Using the heterostructure FET as a vehicle, the principle, computer simulation results, design guidelines, processing, and characterization of the DMGFET are discussed in detail.","doi":"10.1109/16.760391","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel4/16/16454/00760391.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.760391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16454","startPage":"865","endPage":"870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-material gate (DMG) field effect transistor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=760391","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dual-material gate (DMG) field effect transistor","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/760391/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6248095","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-material gate (DMG) field effect transistor","sourcePdf":"00760391.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035166S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"329","articleId":"760391","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":760392,"authors":[{"name":"P.

These islands are pyramidal in shape with a base diagonal of /spl sim/20 nm and height of /spl sim/6-7 nm, depending of growth parameters. They therefore exhibit electronic properties of zero-dimensional systems, or quantum dots. One or more layers of such quantum dots can be stacked and vertically coupled to form the gain region of lasers. We have investigated the properties of such single-layer quantum dot (SLQD) and multilayer quantum dot (MLQD) lasers with a variety of measurements, including some at cryogenic temperatures. The experiments have been complemented with theoretical calculations of the electronic properties and carrier scattering phenomena in the dots. Our objective has been to elucidate the intrinsic behavior of these devices. The lasers exhibit temperature independent threshold currents up to 85 K, with T/sub 0//spl les/670 K. Typical threshold currents of 200-/spl mu/m long room temperature lasers vary from 6 to 20 mA. The small-signal modulation bandwidths of ridge waveguide lasers are 5-7.5 GHz at 300 K and increased to >20 GHz at 80 K. These bandwidths agree well with electron capture times of /spl sim/30 ps determined from high-frequency laser impedance measurements at 300 K and relaxation times of /spl sim/8 ps measured at 18 K by differential transmission pump-probe experiments. From the calculated results we believe that electron-hole scattering intrinsically limits the high-speed performance of these devices, in spite of differential gains as high as /spl sim/7/spl times/10/sup -14/ cm/sup 2/ at room temperature.","doi":"10.1109/16.760392","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","startPage":"871","endPage":"883","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel4/16/16454/00760392.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.760392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16454","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"In(Ga)As/GaAs self-organized quantum dot lasers: DC and small-signal modulation properties","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantum dot lasers","Gallium arsenide","Temperature","Waveguide lasers","Laser theory","Particle scattering","Threshold current","Bandwidth","Pump lasers","Impedance measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum well lasers","semiconductor quantum dots","III-V semiconductors","optical modulation","gallium arsenide","indium compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electron capture time","DC modulation","small-signal modulation","self-organized growth","InGaAs/GaAs strained epitaxial layer","island array","Stranski-Krastanow mode","electronic properties","zero-dimensional system","single layer quantum dot laser","multilayer quantum dot laser","ridge waveguide laser","carrier scattering","threshold current","differential transmission pump-probe measurement","impedance","relaxation time","electron-hole scattering","high-speed characteristics","differential gain","6 to 20 mA","80 to 300 K","5 to 20 GHz","InGaAs-GaAs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","displayDocTitle":"In(Ga)As/GaAs self-organized quantum dot lasers: DC and small-signal modulation properties","volume":"46","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6248096","publicationDate":"May 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/760392/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In(Ga)As/GaAs self-organized quantum dot lasers: DC and small-signal modulation properties","sourcePdf":"00760392.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071754S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"88","articleId":"760392","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":760393,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Although the shallow trench isolation (STI) is widely used for deep submicron devices, it has a great possibility of generating STI dislocations due to its inherently large mechanical stress and damage. When STI dislocations are located within the depletion region of pn junction, anomalous junction leakage current could flow. This junction leakage current degrades the memory cell data retention time and the standby current of DRAM. We resolved the problems from STI dislocations as follows; the crystal defects and the mechanical stress were reduced by optimizing the implantation condition and the densification temperature of trench filled high-density plasma (HDP) oxide, respectively. In addition, the residual mechanical stress before source/drain implantation was relieved through rapid thermal nitridation (RTN). By using these methods, STI dislocations were successfully clamped outside the depletion region of pn junction.","doi":"10.1109/16.760401","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel4/16/16454/00760401.pdf","startPage":"940","endPage":"946","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.760401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16454","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=760401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomalous junction leakage current induced by STI dislocations and its impact on dynamic random access memory devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/760401/","displayDocTitle":"Anomalous junction leakage current induced by STI dislocations and its impact on dynamic random access memory devices","volume":"46","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1999","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6248105","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomalous junction leakage current induced by STI dislocations and its impact on dynamic random access memory devices","sourcePdf":"00760401.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046828S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"41","articleId":"760401","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":760408,"authors":[{"name":"S.P.O.

Such systems will support audio, video, multimedia, data, and speech services in a variety of environments with levels of service for mobile users comparable to service currently available for fixed users. To achieve this, TGMS systems must provide adequate performance (in terms of bits per second) for each user in each of the operating environments foreseen. Despite considerable support from many sources (academia, network equipment manufacturers) the homogeneous network architecture that universal adoption of ATM would have provided seems unlikely to become a reality. The very rapid development of ultra-high-speed members of the Ethernet \"family\" has pre-empted the unique scalability promise of ATM. At the same time, the explosive growth of Internet-based applications and services has ensured that IP will remain the network layer protocol of choice for the vast majority of next-generation systems. This article examines the challenges of handover across a single network domain, between network domains, and specifically between network domains of different levels of QoS. We report on various techniques for supporting mobile terminals, different approaches to handover, and specific issues associated with TCP/IP over wireless links. Finally, we identify some of the more advanced mobile systems R&D projects from the \"seamless integration of advanced multimedia services\" perspective before generating our conclusions.","doi":"10.1109/98.760421","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","startPage":"32","endPage":"37","publicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/98/16455/00760421.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/98.760421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The challenges of seamless handover in future mobile multimedia networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multimedia systems","Mobile communication","Convergence","Speech","Manufacturing","Ethernet networks","Scalability","Explosives","IP networks","Web and internet services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile satellite communication","cellular radio","multimedia communication","Internet","local area networks","asynchronous transfer mode","transport protocols","telecommunication network routing","internetworking","radio links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile multimedia networks","seamless handover","third-generation mobile communications systems","multimedia services","fixed networks","mobile networks","fixed-mobile convergence","speech services","data services","satellite segments","video services","audio services","homogeneous network architecture","ATM","Ethernet","Internet-based applications","IP","network layer protocol","network domains","QoS","TCP/IP","wireless links","advanced mobile systems R&D projects","seamless integration","cellular radio","data routing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","displayDocTitle":"The challenges of seamless handover in future mobile multimedia networks","volume":"6","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6260359","publicationDate":"April 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/760421/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The challenges of seamless handover in future mobile multimedia networks","sourcePdf":"00760421.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04823S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"98","citationCount":"28","articleId":"760421","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":760422,"authors":[{"name":"W.H.W.

In such a scenario reconfigurable terminals, able to adapt to the differing regional radio interfaces, if feasible in the appropriate timescales, appear a very attractive option. In reality, the future of software-defined radio is perhaps, at the same time, both much less and much more than this. At one level, the advent of the true software-reconfigurable \"universal handset\" may lie beyond the launch date of third-generation systems. Equally, however, software radio will profoundly impact not only technology but also industry structures. Software-defined radio reflects the convergence of two dynamically developing technological forces: digital radio and real-time downloadable software. The former has facilitated the wireless revolution, and the latter has both facilitated and ridden the Internet wave. The massive growth and convergence of these two markets is both creating the applications demand for third-generation personal communications and simultaneously threatening some of the existing ground rules of the wireless industry.

However most software DSM systems use the main memory of each machine as a level in a cache hierarchy, replicating copies of shared data in local memory. Since computer memories tend to be much larger than caches, DSM systems have largely ignored memory capacity issues, assuming there is always enough space in main memory in which to replicate data. Applications that access data that exceeds the capacity available in local memory will page to disk, resulting in reduced performance. We have developed a software DSM system based on Cashmere that takes advantage of system-wide memory resources in order to reduce or eliminate paging overhead.

Joining a metacomputer is voluntary, and hence it has to be an endeavor that mutually benefits all parties involved. We identify proportional-share allocation as a key component of such a mutual benefit. Proportional-share allocation is the basis for enforcing the agreement reached among the sites on how to use the metacomputer's resources. We introduce a resource manager that provides proportional-share allocation over a cluster of workstations, assuming applications to be master-slave. This manager is novel because it performs non-preemptive proportional scheduling of multiple processors. A prototype has been implemented and we report on preliminary results. Finally, we discuss how tickets (first-class entities that encapsulate allocation endowments) can be used in practice to enforce the meta-computer agreement, and also how they can ease the site selection to be performed by the application.","doi":"10.1109/IPPS.1999.760453","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 13th International Parallel Processing Symposium and 10th Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing.

Our experience with industrial strength designs, however, shows that structure and timing must be considered from the beginning, and refined concurrently with functionality. We present a C++ library for the modeling of concurrency and timing in an executable system model. Together with the built-in extensibility of C++ this library is the foundation for a rich set of primitives supporting different modeling paradigms in a single language framework. This allows designers to start with a conceptual system capturing functionality, structure and timing as desired and gradually refine it to a fully detailed implementable model using the most appropriate modeling paradigm for each phase and part of the design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the use of C++ for system-on-chip design","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Since clock power consumption is often the largest part of total chip power research in this area becomes urgent. In a SoC the clock depends not only on clock distribution wiring, clock driver sizing and the capability to disable part of the clock network, but also on circuit design style, architectural choice and the clock rate of the IP blocks. The different IP blocks may require that multiple-frequency clocks are distributed on the chip. Our research provides a clock power model for SoC that takes into account these various factors. The impact of architectural, design, and logic style on clock power is studied using adder and register designs. In research, such characterizing information on SoC designs will be used in designing the clock network and estimating its power dissipation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clock power issues in system-on-a-chip designs","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Many directory overflows can be eliminated by using the segment directory element in place of the pointer in the limited directory schemes. Also, the segment directory can be implemented without introducing additional hardware overhead and protocol complexity. The detailed execution-driven simulations show that the segment directory always does better than the pointer and eliminates many directory overflows by up to 85%. The resulting improvement in bandwidth and execution time is analyzed in detail for limited directory schemes having different behaviours, with respect to the reduced directory overflows.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPPS.1999.760473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16457","startPage":"258","endPage":"267","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 13th International Parallel Processing Symposium and 10th Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing.

LLB is intended as a cluster-mapping and task-ordering step in the multi-step class of scheduling algorithms. Unlike current multistep approaches, LLB integrates cluster-mapping and task-ordering in a single step. The benefits of this integration are twofold. First, it allows dynamic load balancing in time, because only the ready tasks are considered in the mapping process. Second, communication is also considered, as opposed to algorithms like WCM and GLB. The algorithm has a low time complexity of O(E+V(log V+log P)), where E is the number of dependences, V is the number of tasks and P is the number of processors. Experimental results show that LLB outperforms known cluster-mapping algorithms of comparable complexity, improving the schedule lengths up to 42%. Furthermore, compared with LCA, a much higher-complexity algorithm, LLB obtains comparable results for fine-grain graphs and yields improvements up to 16% for coarse-grain graphs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scheduling algorithm","Processor scheduling","Load management","Costs","Clustering algorithms","Information technology","Parallel processing","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["processor scheduling","distributed memory systems","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["list-based load balancing","compile-time task scheduling","distributed-memory machines","cluster-mapping","task-ordering","time complexity","LLB","scheduling","task scheduling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=760527","doi":"10.1109/IPPS.1999.760527","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 13th International Parallel Processing Symposium and 10th Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing.

Through a training process, the visual pattern information is stored in a form of numerical weights in memory. When the model is actually implemented in hardware, weight errors and input noises caused by hardware imprecision and imperfect input devices respectively cannot be avoided and consequently the recognition performance usually degrades substantially from the theoretical result. In this paper, the effects of weight imprecision and input noise to the recognition performance of neocognitron are studied through a sensitivity analysis of the model. The sensitivity of an S-cell to weight and input perturbations is first derived, as a function of the weight and input perturbation ratios. An algorithm is proposed to combine the sensitivities of the S-cells in different layers to form the overall sensitivity of the model. The established sensitivity measure is then demonstrated to be a useful tool for hardware design. In addition, it has been found that the decision (recognition) error of neocognitron increases with the weight perturbation, the input perturbation, and the number of weights per neuron. This is similar to the result obtained for the Madaline model. Another important result is that decision error increases with the threshold/selectivity parameter. This supports the functional description of the threshold reported by Fukushina.","doi":"10.1109/5326.760568","startPage":"238","endPage":"249","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5326.760568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16448","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel4/5326/16448/00760568.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensitivity analysis of neocognitron","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/760568/","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity analysis of neocognitron","volume":"29","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6247650","publicationDate":"May 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity analysis of neocognitron","sourcePdf":"00760568.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047468S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16448","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"38","articleId":"760568","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":760572,"authors":[{"name":"Seong-Whan Lee","affiliation":["National Creative Research Initiative Center for Artificial Vision Research, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seong-Whan Lee","id":"37087216000"},{"name":"Sang-Yup Kim","affiliation":["Human Computer, Inc., Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sang-Yup Kim","id":"37087697423"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-6977"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2442"}],"articleNumber":"760572","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=760572","abstract":"Proposes an integrated image segmentation and recognition method using a new type of cascade neural network that has been is developed to train the spatial dependencies in connected handwritten numerals.

In this paper, we consider a class of systems with hybrid features and optimization problems for this class of systems. The word hybrid is motivated by the fact that these systems are characterized by the presence of both a continuous time evolution and a discrete time evolution. A trajectory for these systems evolves following some dynamical constraint and at some fixed or variable times (called location switching times) it jumps following the rules of a discrete time evolution. The definition of hybrid system we give is quite general and covers many interesting applications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimal control","Control systems","Automata","Automatic control","Samarium","Continuous time systems","State-space methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal control","discrete time systems","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid systems","optimal control","stabilization","continuous time evolution","discrete time evolution","dynamical constraint","location switching times"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1998.760582","startPage":"13","endPage":"18 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 37th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (Cat.

A UEP system typically has the same average transmission rate as a corresponding equal error protection (EEP) system but offers an improved perceived signal quality at equal channel signal to noise ratio. In this work we introduce methods of UEP to the perceptual audio coder (PAC). An error sensitivity classifier divides the bits in classes of different sensitivity. Different channel codes are then applied to each class. We show how punctured convolutional codes can be used for UEP of the PAC bitstream. Experimental results for channels with uniform as well as non-uniform noise/interference level indicate that the systems with UEP exhibit graceful degradation and extended range for applications such as digital audio broadcasting (DAB).","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.760616","pdfPath":"/iel4/6110/16398/00760616.pdf","startPage":"2423","endPage":"2426 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

We consider design of modulating waveforms for OFDM in the presence of the delay spread and system impairments such as frequency offset and timing mismatch. We give a complete parameterization of OFDM modulating waveforms. Increasing robustness of OFDM to frequency offsets requires using long modulating waveforms. To make the implementation of OFDM systems with long modulating waveforms feasible we propose fast implementation algorithms. Some preliminary modulating waveform design examples are presented. The presented waveforms demonstrate that the robustness of OFDM systems to impairments can be improved by allowing certain degradation of unnecessarily good performances of the state of the art OFDM systems in ideal operating conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.760629","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

Our particular application is in the field of digital communication systems. Each input data point is taken from a finite set of symbols. We represent the transmission media as a fixed filter with a finite impulse response (FIR), hence a discrete state-space system is formed. Conventional Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques such as the Gibbs sampler are unsuitable for this task because they can only perform processing on a batch of data. Data arrives sequentially, so it would seem sensible to process it in this way. In addition, many communication systems are interactive, so there is a maximum level of latency that can be tolerated before a symbol is decoded. We demonstrate this method by simulation and compare its performance to existing techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/760637/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 March 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6370545","volume":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fixed-lag blind equalization and sequence estimation in digital communications systems using sequential importance sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fixed-lag blind equalization and sequence estimation in digital communications systems using sequential importance sampling","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00760637.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03909S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"16398","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6110","citationCount":"7","articleId":"760637","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":760643,"authors":[{"name":"Shan Mo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake, UT, USA"],"lastName":"Shan Mo","id":"38556420000"},{"name":"C.

These distortions are more severe for non-constant envelope modulations such as 16-QAM. Over the last years neural networks (NN) have emerged as competitive tools for linear and nonlinear channel equalization. However, their main drawback is often slow convergence speed which results in poor tracking capabilities. The present paper combines simple NN structures with conventional equalizers. The NN techniques are shown to efficiently approximate the optimal decision boundaries which results in good symbol error rate (SER) performance.

The transmission delays in asynchronous channels need to be estimated in practice and are subject to estimation errors, which may cause severe performance degradation for most detectors assuming perfect synchronization. As the fundamental framework of the robust detector, an asynchronous subspace detection scheme based on oblique projection is introduced and examined in comparison with the conventional RAKE receiver and the multipath decorrelator. The performance degradation of the subspace detector due to delay estimation errors is also investigated. The robust detector shows reliable performance even when the errors are much larger than those of delay estimation algorithms like MUSIC, and it is not affected by the near-far problem.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust detection in asynchronous CDMA multipath fading channels","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

We then explain how we can increase performance at the expense of a minimal increase in complexity. We show that as complexity increases to the level of that of the optimal receiver, our design approach automatically produces the optimal receiver.

It is derived under the constraint of realizability, requiring finite smoothing lag and causal filters both in the forward and feedback link. The proposed DFE, which provides an optimal structure as well as optimal filter degrees, is obtained as an explicit solution in terms of the channel and noise description. A generalization of the scalar zero-forcing DFE is also presented. Conditions for the existence of such an equalizer are discussed. We argue that when no zero-forcing equalizer exists, poor near-far resistance of the corresponding optimal minimum mean square error DFE can be expected. A numerical example indicates the potential advantages of using a decision feedback equalizer with appropriate structure.

It is very difficult to assure such accuracy due to many factors affecting the precision of motion, such as friction and backlash in the drive system. The standard PID (proportional-integral-derivative) type servo control algorithms are not capable of delivering the desired precision under the influence of friction and backlash. In the paper, the friction and the disturbance are identified by a neural network. The weight adaptation rule, defined as a reinforcement adaptive-learning rule, is derived from the Lyapunov stability theory. Therefore the proposed scheme can be applicable to a wide class of mechanical systems.

Such distributed applications frequently give rise to nonlinear distributed decision and control problems in the presence of uncertainties such as the effects of the local decisions on the overall objective and disparate system state information. Artificial neural networks in the past have proved effective in adaptive realization of nonlinear decision-making and control rules. In order to apply them to distributed applications, new interconnection models as well as adaptation and learning methods are needed to cope with distributed sources of uncertainty such as those mentioned above. Motivated by studies in large-scale systems theory, we present a team theoretic interconnection of neural networks. The problem that arises due to the disparate nature of the state information available to the decision-makers is highlighted. This problem is overcome by constructing local approximations to the overall performance function using only the locally available information. These local performance functions (termed local critics), in turn, yield adaptive methods for realization of distributed decision rules using neural networks. Simulation studies have demonstrated the applicability of the above approach to many distributed decision-making problems.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1998.760841","pdfPath":"/iel5/6103/16425/00760841.pdf","startPage":"1082","endPage":"1083 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 37th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (Cat.

If the nodes in the network are assumed to cooperate, perhaps in a distributed and decentralized fashion, in routing each others' packets, as is the case in ad hoc wireless networks, then each node should transmit with just enough power to guarantee connectivity of the overall network. Towards this end, we determine the critical power at which a node in the network needs to transmit in order to ensure that the network is connected with probability one as the number of nodes in the network goes to infinity.

The impairments taken into consideration in the system are the non-linear effect of a travelling wave tube amplifier (TWTA) onboard the satellite (AM-to-AM and AM-to-PM conversions), additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and mobile propagation shadowing channel. The performance of the conventional detector receiver for MAI and the propagation channel modelled as shadowing (lognormal and Rayleigh) in suburban areas are evaluated both analytically and by importance sampling simulation. The obtained results of both the analytical and simulation methods, in terms of the dependence of the error probability on shadowing channel and the down-link noise at different values of input back-off of TWTA, are in good agreement.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient evaluation of the error probabilities of CDMA communication in mobile satellite channel","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Sixteenth National Radio Science Conference.

These two measures are highly inter-dependent and must be evaluated together. The relationship between the two probabilities directly affects the overall performance of the sensor in the field. In this paper we introduce a novel false alarm non-parametric filter based on the random neural network (RNN) model and the /spl delta/-technique. The study is based on mine detection using electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensors. The minefield data are pre-processed via the /spl delta/-technique before applying it to the RNN. The RNN has a predefined structure that tries to implement a mapping close enough in some precise sense to the discrimination function between non-mine and mine patterns. Limited numbers of non-mine and mine patterns, extracted from a small calibration area for a certain minefield provided by DARPA, are used for training the RNN. We show that the RNN gives effective decisions on patterns measured on other locations using different EMI sensor. The results show that the RNN produces a probability of detection up to 100 per cent with a substantial reduction of false alarms over the /spl delta/-technique (up to 40 per cent false alarm filtering).","doi":"10.1109/NRSC.1999.760927","startPage":"C43/1","endPage":"C4310","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Sixteenth National Radio Science Conference.

We argue that the retention time, namely log(t/sub H/), varies linearly with temperature T rather than with 1/T as commonly assumed, yielding an important reduction in the extrapolated time-to-failure. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the physical consistency of the new model. In particular, data-retention of EPROM devices and leakage current of interpoly dielectric and gate oxide have been investigated over a wide range of temperatures. Finally, it is shown that our model reconciles seemingly controversial activation energy data from the literature.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/55/16464/00761013.pdf","startPage":"197","endPage":"199","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","doi":"10.1109/55.761013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/55.761013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16464","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=761013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new extrapolation law for data-retention time-to-failure of nonvolatile memories","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Extrapolation","Nonvolatile memory","EPROM","Acceleration","Leakage current","Dielectric devices","Temperature distribution","Dielectric losses","Linear predictive coding","Microelectronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extrapolation","failure analysis","life testing","integrated circuit testing","EPROM","integrated memory circuits","leakage currents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extrapolation law","data-retention time-to-failure","nonvolatile memories","Arrhenius law","highly accelerated life-tests","physical consistency","EPROM devices","leakage current","interpoly dielectric","gate oxide","activation energy data"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761013/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","displayDocTitle":"A new extrapolation law for data-retention time-to-failure of nonvolatile memories","volume":"20","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6248321","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new extrapolation law for data-retention time-to-failure of nonvolatile memories","sourcePdf":"00761013.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052572S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"17","articleId":"761013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":761016,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This work presents experimental mobility data of MOSFETs fabricated on different polytypes as well as capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements of corresponding n-type MOS structures which give evidence that the low inversion channel mobility in 4H-SiC is caused by a high density of SiC-SiO/sub 2/ interface states close to the conduction band. These defects are believed to be inherent to all SiC polytypes and energetically pinned at around 2.9 eV above the valence band edge. Thus, for polytypes with band gaps smaller than 4H-SiC like 6H-SiC and 15R-SiC, the majority of these states will become resonant with the conduction band at room temperature or above, thus remarkably suppressing their negative effect on the channel mobility. In order to realize high performance power MOSFETs the results reveal that 15R-SiC is the best candidate among all currently accessible SiC polytypes.","doi":"10.1109/55.761027","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/55/16464/00761027.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/55.761027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16464","startPage":"241","endPage":"244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Significantly improved performance of MOSFETs on silicon carbide using the 15R-SiC polytype","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=761027","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Significantly improved performance of MOSFETs on silicon carbide using the 15R-SiC polytype","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761027/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6255220","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Significantly improved performance of MOSFETs on silicon carbide using the 15R-SiC polytype","sourcePdf":"00761027.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058433S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"191","articleId":"761027","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":761033,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Establishing provable properties requires a mathematical perspective on the software radio architecture. This paper contributes to that perspective by critically reviewing the fundamental concept of the software radio, using mathematical models to characterize this rapidly emerging technology in the context of similar technologies like programmable digital radios. The software radio delivers dynamically defined services through programmable processing capacity that has the mathematical structure of the Turing machine. The bounded recursive functions, a subset of the total recursive functions, are shown to be the largest class of Turing-computable functions for which software radios exhibit provable stability in plug-and-play scenarios. Understanding the topological properties of the software radio architecture promotes plug-and-play applications and cost-effective reuse. Analysis of these topological properties yields a layered distributed virtual machine reference model and a set of architecture design principles for the software radio. These criteria may be useful in defining interfaces among hardware, middleware, and higher level software components that are needed for cost-effective software reuse.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/49/16463/00761033.pdf","startPage":"514","endPage":"538","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.761033","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.761033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16463","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=761033","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software radio architecture: a mathematical perspective","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software radio","Computer architecture","Service oriented architecture","Mathematical model","Digital communication","Turing machines","Stability","Application software","Virtual machining","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software architecture","software reusability","telecommunication computing","radio equipment","Turing machines","digital radio","recursive functions","distributed processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software radio architecture","product developers","service providers","provable properties","mathematical models","programmable digital radios","programmable processing","Turing machine","bounded recursive functions","total recursive functions","Turing-computable functions","stability","topological properties","plug-and-play applications","layered distributed virtual machine reference model","interfaces","hardware","middleware","cost-effective software reuse","software components"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761033/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","displayDocTitle":"Software radio architecture: a mathematical perspective","volume":"17","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6253772","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software radio architecture: a mathematical perspective","sourcePdf":"00761033.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041721S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"132","articleId":"761033","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":761034,"authors":[{"name":"R.H.

This paper surveys the state-of-the-art of ADCs, including experimental converters and commercially available parts. The distribution of resolution versus sampling rate provides insight into ADC performance limitations. At sampling rates below 2 million samples per second (Gs/s), resolution appears to be limited by thermal noise. At sampling rates ranging from /spl sim/2 Ms/s to /spl sim/4 giga samples per second (Gs/s), resolution falls off by /spl sim/1 bit for every doubling of the sampling rate. This behavior may be attributed to uncertainty in the sampling instant due to aperture jitter. For ADCs operating at multi-Gs/s rates, the speed of the device technology is also a limiting factor due to comparator ambiguity. Many ADC architectures and integrated circuit technologies have been proposed and implemented to push back these limits. The trend toward single-chip ADCs brings lower power dissipation. However, technological progress as measured by the product of the ADC resolution (bits) times the sampling rate is slow. Average improvement is only /spl sim/1.5 bits for any given sampling frequency over the last six-eight years.","doi":"10.1109/49.761034","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.761034","startPage":"539","endPage":"550","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/49/16463/00761034.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog-to-digital converter survey and analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761034/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","displayDocTitle":"Analog-to-digital converter survey and analysis","volume":"17","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6253773","publicationDate":"April 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog-to-digital converter survey and analysis","sourcePdf":"00761034.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051713S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"1283","articleId":"761034","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":761035,"authors":[{"name":"H.J.

In addition, ISOPs are shown to be useful for simplifying halfband filters that usually follow CIC filtering. As a result, a modified halfband filter (MHBF) is introduced which is simpler than conventional halfband filters. The proposed decimation filter for programmable downconverter is a cascade of a CIC filter, an ISOP, MHBFs, and a programmable finite impulse response filter. A procedure for designing the decimation filter is developed. In particular, an optimization technique that simultaneously designs the ISOP and programmable FIR filters is presented.

Two key issues in the implementation of software radios are the development of optimal receivers that require the minimum number of bits in the wide-band analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and efficient channelizers that extract individual channels from the digitized wide-band signal. In this paper, both of these issues are studied in detail for cellular base stations. A computationally efficient wide-band channelizer is presented. This channelizer is closely related to the discrete Fourier transform filter bank used in transmultiplexers. It is shown that the complexity of the proposed channelizer is significantly less (2-50/spl times/) than the complexity of conventional channelizers. An optimal receiver that explicitly takes into account the effect of the quantization noise of the wide-band ADC is also derived. The analysis of the ADC noise provides guidelines for specifying wide-band ADC for use in cellular applications. The development of the channelizer and the optimal receiver yield important insights into the implementation of cellular software radios. All of the key results of this paper are applied to a detailed example based on the Digital Advanced Mobile Phone System (D-AMPS, IS-54/IS-136) cellular standard. The bit-error rate (BER) performance simulations of a D-AMPS wide band receiver is presented as a part of this example.","doi":"10.1109/49.761036","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/49/16463/00761036.pdf","startPage":"561","endPage":"573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.761036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software radio issues in cellular base stations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=761036","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761036/","displayDocTitle":"Software radio issues in cellular base stations","volume":"17","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6253775","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software radio issues in cellular base stations","sourcePdf":"00761036.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035348S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"103","articleId":"761036","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":761037,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.

Our approach, which we refer to as virtual radios, also depends upon high performance ADCs. However, rather than use DSPs, we have chosen to ride the curve of rapidly improving workstation hardware. We use wideband digitization and then perform all of the digital signal processing in user space on a general purpose workstation. This approach allows us to experiment with new approaches to signal processing that exploit the hardware and software resources of the workstation. Furthermore, it allows us to experiment with different ways of structuring systems in which the radio component of communication devices is integrated with higher-level applications. This paper describes the design and performance of an environment we have constructed that facilitates building virtual radios and of two applications built using that environment. The environment consists of an input/output (I/O) subsystem that provides high bandwidth low latency user-level access to digitized signals and a programming environment that provides an infrastructure for building applications. The applications, which exemplify some of the benefits of virtual radios, are a software cellular receiver and a novel wireless network interface.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual radios","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.761038","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/49/16463/00761038.pdf","startPage":"591","endPage":"602","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.761038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16463","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=761038","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761038/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","displayDocTitle":"Virtual radios","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6253777","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual radios","sourcePdf":"00761038.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078047S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"63","articleId":"761038","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":761039,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The performance of each software module is evaluated using both a % CPU metric and a processor-independent metric based on SPEC benchmarks.

Due to their lower complexity, subtractive interference cancellation approaches are attractive for the practical implementation of multiuser detection. In a parallel interference cancellation receiver, it is practical to use the soft outputs of a matched filter bank for amplitude estimation. A bias arises in the decision statistics, however, due to imperfect estimation and interference cancellation. In this paper, the source of the bias is explicitly recognized, and a partial interference cancellation scheme that mitigates the negative effects of biased estimation and significantly improves system performance is proposed. A practical real-time algorithm that significantly reduces the implementation complexity of this scheme without sacrificing performance is then derived. To facilitate a software radio implementation, the signal processing complexity of the approach is characterized. The real-time processing algorithm is tested via implementation in software on a floating-point general-purpose DSP. The prototype includes a flexible software-based architecture which performs IF sampling and uses digital downconversion prior to baseband processing. The hardware test setup is described, and the results are presented and compared with simulation and analytical results. The experimental results confirm the simulation and analytical results which show large performance gains over the conventional matched filter.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Interference cancellation","Multiuser detection","Signal processing algorithms","Matched filters","Analytical models","Radio frequency","Amplitude estimation","Statistics","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","spread spectrum communication","code division multiple access","radio receivers","multiuser channels","radiofrequency interference","interference suppression","signal detection","matched filters","channel bank filters","telecommunication computing","software architecture","AWGN channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DSP-based DS-CDMA multiuser receiver","partial parallel interference cancellation","multiuser detection","RF technology","mixed-signal technology","digital technology","subtractive interference cancellation","parallel interference cancellation receiver","soft outputs","matched filter bank","amplitude estimation","decision statistics","imperfect estimation","bias source","biased estimation","system performance","practical real-time algorithm","implementation complexity reduction","software radio implementation","signal processing complexity","real-time processing algorithm","floating-point general-purpose DSP","software-based architecture","IF sampling","digital downconversion","baseband processing","hardware test setup","simulation results","analytical results","AWGN channels"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=761040","doi":"10.1109/49.761040","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/49/16463/00761040.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.761040","startPage":"613","endPage":"630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16463","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A DSP-based DS-CDMA multiuser receiver employing partial parallel interference cancellation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A DSP-based DS-CDMA multiuser receiver employing partial parallel interference cancellation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761040/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","volume":"17","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6253779","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A DSP-based DS-CDMA multiuser receiver employing partial parallel interference cancellation","sourcePdf":"00761040.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042587S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"71","articleId":"761040","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":761042,"authors":[{"name":"P.G.

Adaptive beamforming with smart antennas at the receiver increases the carrier-to-interference ratio (CIR) in a wireless link. This paper considers a wireless network with beamforming capabilities at the receiver which allows two or more transmitters to share the same channel to communicate with the base station. The concrete computational complexity and algorithm structure of a base station are considered in terms of a software radio system model, initially with an omnidirectional antenna. The software radio computational model is then expanded to characterize a network with smart antennas. The application of the software radio smart antenna is demonstrated through two examples. First, traffic improvement in a network with a smart antenna is considered, and the implementation of a hand-off algorithm in the software radio is presented. The blocking probabilities of the calls and total carried traffic in the system under different traffic policies are derived. The analytical and numerical results show that adaptive beamforming at the receiver reduces the probability of blocking and forced termination of the calls and increases the total carried traffic in the system. Then, a joint beamforming and power control algorithm is implemented in a software radio smart antenna in a CDMA network. This shows that, by using smart antennas, each user can transmit with much lower power, and therefore the system capacity increases significantly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761043/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1999","volume":"17","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6253782","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Software radio architecture with smart antennas: a tutorial on algorithms and complexity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software radio architecture with smart antennas: a tutorial on algorithms and complexity","sourcePdf":"00761043.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062026S","chronDate":"April  1999","isNumber":"16463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"51","articleId":"761043","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":761044,"authors":[{"name":"Jind-Yeh Lee","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Jind-Yeh Lee","id":"37350920200"},{"name":"H.

In practice, the propagation environment is nonideal with shadowing, severe stationary, and fast multipath fading. In this paper, the combination of adaptive antenna arrays and equalization techniques is employed to achieve reliable high-bit-rate wireless communications in a multipath, multiinterferer environment. A low-complexity receiver structure is investigated for the feasibility of portable wireless communications applications. The performance of the proposed receiver is analyzed in both outdoor and indoor multipath conditions. The simulations show that, although the adaptive beamformer is capable of cancelling long-delayed multipath reflections in the outdoor environment within its degrees of freedom, the adaptive equalizer is mandatory to compensate for the residual of the outdoor environment or the short-delayed multipath reflections of the indoor environment to achieve a high-quality link and high data rate. The digital circuits of the proposed receiver are estimated to perform 50 billion operations per second (GOPS) of digital signal processing functions, and the gate count is estimated to be 100 000 for a custom integrated circuit implementation.","doi":"10.1109/49.761044","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/49/16463/00761044.pdf","startPage":"677","endPage":"688","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.761044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive antenna arrays and equalization techniques for high bit-rate QAM receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=761044","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761044/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive antenna arrays and equalization techniques for high bit-rate QAM receivers","volume":"17","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6253783","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive antenna arrays and equalization techniques for high bit-rate QAM receivers","sourcePdf":"00761044.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044506S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"8","articleId":"761044","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":761047,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodong Li","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Wireless Technology Research Department, Lucent Technologies, Holmdel, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaodong Li","id":"37087275110"},{"name":"J.A.

It describes code-division multiplexing (CDMA) and time-division multiplexing (TDMA) of a receiver channel in an electric field sensing system. The only hardware used is a front-end gain stage consisting of two opamps and a microcontroller. The modulation and demodulation operations are implemented entirely in the microcontroller software. Multiple coded waveforms are transmitted simultaneously, and induce a combined signal on a single receive electrode. The combined signal, after passing through a single analog front end terminating in an analog-to-digital converter, is separated into the four original component signals by a software demodulation operation. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) achieved by the code-division multiplexed system given a fixed measurement time is compared to the SNR achieved by a time-division multiplexed implementation given the same total measurement time. The paper also compares the scaling of TDMA and CDMA performance with the number of transmitted channels and the number of demodulated channels.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.761048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16463","startPage":"725","endPage":"731","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/49/16463/00761048.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code-division multiplexing of a sensor channel: a software implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761048/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Code-division multiplexing of a sensor channel: a software implementation","publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6253787","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code-division multiplexing of a sensor channel: a software implementation","sourcePdf":"00761048.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03301S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"4","articleId":"761048","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":761053,"authors":[{"name":"K.D.

By exploiting the signal cyclostationarity, the SCORE algorithms presented by Agee, Schell and Gardner (1990) have been shown to be effective in performing adaptive beamforming without requiring the direction vector of the desired signal. However, these algorithms suffer from severe performance degradation even if there is a small mismatch in the cycle frequency of the desired signal. In this paper, we first evaluate the performance of the SCORE algorithms in the presence of cycle frequency error (CFE). An analytical formula is derived to show the behavior of the performance degradation due to CFE. Based on the theoretical result, we then develop an efficient method in conjunction with the SCORE algorithms to achieve robust adaptive beamforming against the CFE. Several simulation examples for confirming the theoretical analysis and showing the effectiveness of the proposed method are also presented.","doi":"10.1109/8.761062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16465","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.761062","endPage":"241","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/16465/00761062.pdf","startPage":"233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust adaptive array beamforming for cyclostationary signals under cycle frequency error","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761062/","displayDocTitle":"Robust adaptive array beamforming for cyclostationary signals under cycle frequency error","volume":"47","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"6248082","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust adaptive array beamforming for cyclostationary signals under cycle frequency error","sourcePdf":"00761062.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033102S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"23","articleId":"761062","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":761063,"authors":[{"name":"M.R.

This area of computing involves different issues and concepts when compared with conventional computing systems. One of these concepts is context lending. The context refers to the coded configuration information to implement a particular circuit behaviour. An important problem for reconfigurable computing is the scheduling of a group of kernels (sub-tasks) that constitute a complex application for minimum execution time. In this paper, we show how the different execution orders for these sub-tasks may result in varying levels of performance.

Given a system specification consisting of multiple periodic task graphs as well as a database of core and integrated circuit characteristics, MOCSYN synthesizes real-time heterogeneous single-chip hardware software architectures using an adaptive multiobjective genetic algorithm that is designed to escape local minima. The use of multiobjective optimization allows a single system synthesis run to produce multiple designs which trade off different architectural features. Integrated circuit price, power consumption, and area are optimized under hard real-time constraints. MOCSYN differs from previous work by considering problems unique to single-chip systems. It solves the problem of providing clock signals to cores composing a system-on-a-chip. It produces a bus structure which balances ease of layout with the reduction of bus contention. In addition, it carries out floorplan block placement within its inner loop allowing accurate estimation of global communication delays and power consumption.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16399","publicationTitle":"Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition, 1999.

Key features of our language-driven design methodology include: a mixed behavioral/structural representation supporting a natural specification of the architecture, explicit specification of the memory, subsystem allowing novel memory organizations and hierarchies; clean syntax and ease of modification supporting architectural exploration; a single specification supporting consistency and completeness checking of the architecture; and efficient specification of architectural resource constraints allowing extraction of detailed reservation tables for compiler scheduling. We illustrate key features of EXPRESSION through simple examples and demonstrate its efficacy in supporting exploration and automatic software toolkit generation for an embedded SOC codesign flow.","doi":"10.1109/DATE.1999.761170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16399","startPage":"485","endPage":"490","pdfPath":"/iel4/6133/16399/00761170.pdf","publicationTitle":"Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition, 1999.

This coupled with dynamic decomposition enables trade-off of many more alternatives than in conventional mapping algorithms. The wavefront algorithm maps optimally for minimal delay on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) when a gain based delay model is used. It is optimal with respect to the arrival times on each path in the network. A special timing mode for multi-source nets allows minimization of other (non-delay) metrics as a secondary objective while maintaining delay optimality.","displayPublicationTitle":"Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition, 1999.

This was done by introducing the cost function based on the infeasibility distance of the partitioning solution and carefully tuning the basic parameters of the classical algorithms such as definition of size constraints for feasible moves, handling solutions stack, selecting best cluster to move, etc. The proposed method obtains results comparable to the best published results, and even outperforms them for the largest benchmarks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative improvement based multi-way netlist partitioning for FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/DATE.1999.761187","startPage":"587","endPage":"594","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.1999.761187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16399","publicationTitle":"Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition, 1999.

It is demonstrated that an input CIM that connects N/sup in/ segments to a logic cell input requires N/sup in/ test configurations and that an output CIM that connects a logic cell output to N/sup out/ segments requires 2 test configurations. Then, it is proven that a set of K/sup in/ input CIMs can be tested in parallel making the number of required test configurations equal to N/sup in/.

Although developed with shell mapping in mind, VCMA can also equalize data from other shaping methods such as trellis shaping.

These statistics typically show that there is little room for prediction of channel properties such as received power or complex taps of the impulse response coefficients, at least when linear predictor structures are considered. We use mutual information estimation to measure statistical dependencies in sequences of wideband mobile radio channel data and find significant nonlinear dependencies, far exceeding the linear component. Based on these upper limits for the predictability of channel evolution over time intervals up to 30 ms ahead, we develop practical nonlinear predictor systems using multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). We demonstrate computationally efficient schemes that increase the prediction horizon beyond 10 ms, compared to less than 4 ms with linear predictors at comparable prediction gains.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.761246","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

These /spl mu/-law codecs are not well suited for the latest generation of high-speed digital voice-band modems requiring PCM data transmission at the quantization levels of the codec. In this paper, we have shown that using a linear codec in the telephone network is optimal for PCM transmission (in terms of a minimum symbol error rate) for the range of SNRs observed over most modern telephone lines. We demonstrate that with a linear codec we get a dramatic improvement in the performance of these PCM modems without any increase in the complexity of the modem. In practice, it would be necessary and relatively simple to implement an additional feature in the /spl mu/-law codec to detect a voice-band modem during the initial phase of training and switch to a linear companding characteristic.","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

Yamada, Tazaki, and Gray (1980) generalized the results to distortion measures that are increasing functions of the norm of their argument. In both cases, the distortion is uniquely determined by the vector quantization error, i.e., the Euclidean difference between the original vector and the codeword into which it is quantized. We generalize these asymptotic bounds to input-weighted quadratic distortion measures and measures that are approximately output-weighted-quadratic when the distortion is small, a class of distortion measures often claimed to be perceptually meaningful. An approximation of the asymptotic distortion based on Gersho's conjecture is derived as well. We also consider the problem of source mismatch, where the quantizer is designed using a probability density different from the true source density. The resulting asymptotic performance in terms of distortion increase in decibels is shown to be linear in the relative entropy between the true and estimated probability densities.","doi":"10.1109/18.761252","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel4/18/16466/00761252.pdf","startPage":"1082","endPage":"1091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.761252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16466","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic performance of vector quantizers with a perceptual distortion measure","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=761252","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761252/","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic performance of vector quantizers with a perceptual distortion measure","volume":"45","issue":"4","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6255076","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic performance of vector quantizers with a perceptual distortion measure","sourcePdf":"00761252.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057323S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"47","articleId":"761252","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":761254,"authors":[{"name":"R.W.

Each encoder has access to a certain subset of the sources, each decoder has access to certain subset of the encoders, and each decoder reconstructs a certain subset of the sources almost perfectly. The connectivity between the sources and the encoders, the connectivity between the encoders and the decoders, and the reconstruction requirements for the decoders are all arbitrary. Our goal is to characterize the admissible coding rate region. Despite the generality of the problem, we have developed an approach which enables us to study all cases on the same footing. We obtain inner and outer bounds of the admissible coding rate region in terms of /spl Gamma//sub N/* and /spl Gamma/~/sub N/*, respectively, which are fundamental regions in the entropy space defined by Yeung (1991). So far, there has not been a full characterization of /spl Gamma//sub N/*, so these bounds cannot be evaluated explicitly except for some special cases. Nevertheless, we obtain an alternative outer bound which can be evaluated explicitly. We show that this bound is tight for all the special cases for which the admissible coding rate region is known. The model we study in this paper is more general than all previously reported models on multilevel diversity coding, and the tools we use are new in multiuser information theory.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.761254","doi":"10.1109/18.761254","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel4/18/16466/00761254.pdf","startPage":"1111","endPage":"1120","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16466","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed source coding for satellite communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed source coding for satellite communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761254/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"4","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6255078","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed source coding for satellite communications","sourcePdf":"00761254.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038618S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"102","articleId":"761254","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":761255,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The goal of system design is to exploit this capacity in a practical way. An effective approach to increasing data rate over wireless channels is to employ space-time coding techniques appropriate to multiple transmit antennas. These space-time codes introduce temporal and spatial correlation into signals transmitted from different antennas, so as to provide diversity at the receiver, and coding gain over an uncoded system. For large number of transmit antennas and at high bandwidth efficiencies, the receiver may become too complex whenever correlation across transmit antennas is introduced. This paper dramatically reduces encoding and decoding complexity by partitioning antennas at the transmitter into small groups, and using individual space-time codes, called the component codes, to transmit information from each group of antennas. At the receiver, an individual space-time code is decoded by a novel linear processing technique that suppresses signals transmitted by other groups of antennas by treating them as interference. A simple receiver structure is derived that provides diversity and coding gain over uncoded systems. This combination of array processing at the receiver and coding techniques for multiple transmit antennas can provide reliable and very high data rate communication over narrowband wireless channels. A refinement of this basic structure gives rise to a multilayered space-time architecture that both generalizes and improves upon the layered space-time architecture proposed by Foschini (see Bell Labs Tech. J., vol.1, no.2, 1996).","doi":"10.1109/18.761255","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.761255","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel4/18/16466/00761255.pdf","startPage":"1121","endPage":"1128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16466","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined array processing and space-time coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761255/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","displayDocTitle":"Combined array processing and space-time coding","volume":"45","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6255079","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined array processing and space-time coding","sourcePdf":"00761255.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032037S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"357","articleId":"761255","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":761256,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Attention is focused primarily on the author's canonical statistical-physical Class A and Class B models. In particular, Class A noise describes the type of electromagnetic interference (EMI) often encountered in telecommunication applications, where this ambient noise is largely due to other, \"intelligent\" telecommunication operations. On the other hand, ambient Class B noise usually represents man-made or natural \"nonintelligent\"-i.e., nonmessage-bearing noise-and is highly impulsive. Class A noise is not an /spl alpha/-stable process, nor is it reducible to such, except in the limiting Gaussian cases of high-density noise (by the central limit theorem). Class B noise is also asymptotically normal (before model approximation). Under rather broad conditions, principally governed by the source propagation and distribution scenarios, the PDF of Class B noise alone (no Gaussian component) can usually be approximated by (1) a symmetric Gaussian /spl alpha/-stable (S/spl alpha/S) model in the case of narrowband reception, or when the PDF /spl omega//sub 1/(/spl alpha/) of the amplitude is symmetric; and (2) a nonsymmetric /spl alpha/-stable (NS/spl alpha/S) model (no Gaussian component) can be constructed in broadband regimes. New results here include: (i) counting functional methods for constructing the general qth-order characteristic functions (CFs) of Class A and Class B noise, from which (all) moments and (in principle), the PDFs follow; (ii) the first-order CFs, PDFs, and cumulative probabilities (APDs) of nonsymmetric broadband Class B noise, extended to include additive Gauss noise (AGN); (iii) proof of the existence of all moments in the basic Class A and Class B models; (iv) the key physical role of AGN and the fact that AGN removes /spl alpha/-stability; (v) the explicit roles of the propagation and distribution scenarios; and (vi) extension to noise fields. Although telecommunication applications are emphasized, Class A and Class B noise models apply selectively, but equally well, to other physical regimes, e.g., underwater acoustics and EM (radar, optics, etc.). Supportive empirical data are included.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.761256","doi":"10.1109/18.761256","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel4/18/16466/00761256.pdf","startPage":"1129","endPage":"1149","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16466","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Gaussian noise models in signal processing for telecommunications: new methods an results for class A and class B noise models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Non-Gaussian noise models in signal processing for telecommunications: new methods an results for class A and class B noise models","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761256/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"4","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6255080","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Gaussian noise models in signal processing for telecommunications: new methods an results for class A and class B noise models","sourcePdf":"00761256.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047055S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"462","articleId":"761256","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":761261,"authors":[{"name":"T.

An accurate and consistent classification can greatly reduce fingerprint matching time for a large database. We present a fingerprint classification algorithm which is able to achieve an accuracy better than previously reported in the literature. We classify fingerprints into five categories: whorl, right loop, left loop, arch, and tented arch. The algorithm uses a novel representation (FingerCode) and is based on a two-stage classifier to make a classification. It has been tested on 4000 images in the NIST-4 database. For the five-class problem, a classification accuracy of 90 percent is achieved (with a 1.8 percent rejection during the feature extraction phase). For the four-class problem (arch and tented arch combined into one class), we are able to achieve a classification accuracy of 94.8 percent (with 1.8 percent rejection). By incorporating a reject option at the classifier, the classification accuracy can be increased to 96 percent for the five-class classification task, and to 97.8 percent for the four-class classification task after a total of 32.5 percent of the images are rejected.","doi":"10.1109/34.761265","startPage":"348","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel4/34/16468/00761265.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.761265","endPage":"359","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multichannel approach to fingerprint classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761265/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","displayDocTitle":"A multichannel approach to fingerprint classification","volume":"21","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6242786","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multichannel approach to fingerprint classification","sourcePdf":"00761265.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026439S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"376","articleId":"761265","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":761266,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This is done from the point of view of the cryptographer with a particular eye on applications in quantum cryptography. Each of the measures considered is rooted in an analogous classical measure of distinguishability for probability distributions: namely, the probability of an identification error, the Kolmogorov distance, the Bhattacharyya coefficient, and the Shannon (1948) distinguishability (as defined through mutual information). These measures have a long history of use in statistical pattern recognition and classical cryptography. We obtain several inequalities that relate the quantum distinguishability measures to each other, one of which may be crucial for proving the security of quantum cryptographic key distribution. In another vein, these measures and their connecting inequalities are used to define a single notion of cryptographic exponential indistinguishability for two families of quantum states. This is a tool that may prove useful in the analysis of various quantum-cryptographic protocols.","doi":"10.1109/18.761271","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel4/18/16466/00761271.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.761271","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16466","startPage":"1216","endPage":"1227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cryptographic distinguishability measures for quantum-mechanical states","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=761271","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cryptographic distinguishability measures for quantum-mechanical states","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761271/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"4","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6255086","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cryptographic distinguishability measures for quantum-mechanical states","sourcePdf":"00761271.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043351S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"385","articleId":"761271","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":761273,"authors":[{"name":"P.R.J.

Oversampling w.r.t. the chip rate is applied to the cyclostationary received signal and multi-antenna reception is considered, leading to a linear multichannel model. Channels for different users are considered to be FIR and of possibly different lengths. We consider an individualized linear MMSE receiver for a given user, exploiting its spreading sequence and timing information. The blind determination of the receiver boils down to the blind channel identification. We explore blind channel identifiability requirements. Sufficiency of these requirements is established and it is shown that if zero-forcing conditions can be satisfied, then the CDMA channel (and hence the receiver) is identifiable with probability 1. It is also shown that linear MMSE receivers obtained by different criteria (including a new one) have the same identifiability requirements asymptotically in SNR.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.761299","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

ILSE is monotonically convergent and performs very well, but its complexity is exponential in the number of signals; ILSP is computationally cheaper, but is not guaranteed to converge monotonically, and leaves much to be desired in terms of BER-SNR performance relative to ILSE.

A one-tap equalizer is an essential part of the MCM system and channel estimation is needed to obtain the coefficient of the equalizer. Lack of correct channel estimation may cause significant performance degradation. We propose to use the cyclic prefix to estimate the channel for the MCM system. We found that the cyclic prefix originally used solely to guarantee the optimality of modulation using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) can be viewed as a source of channel information. Based on this observation, we propose a joint channel estimation and equalization algorithm using the cyclic prefix.

Most wideband and multicarrier uplink CDMA schemes suppress MUI statistically in the presence of unknown multipath. For fading resistance, they all rely on transmit- or receive-diversity and multichannel equalization based on bandwidth-consuming training or blind techniques. Either way, they impose restrictive and difficult to check conditions on the FIR channel nulls. Relying on symbol blocking, we design a mutually-orthogonal usercode-receiver (AMOUR) system for quasi-synchronous blind CDMA that eliminates MUI deterministically and mitigates fading irrespective of the unknown multipath and the adopted signal constellation. Analytic evaluation and preliminary simulations reveal the generality, flexibility, and superior performance of AMOUR over competing alternatives.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mutually orthogonal transceivers for blind uplink CDMA irrespective of multipath channel nulls","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

The research exploits the asymptotic equivalence of Toeplitz and circulant matrices to estimate the Hessian matrix of a quadratic form. Research shows that the Hessian matrix exhibits a specific structure. As a result, when combined with the Rayleigh minimization algorithm, it provides an efficient method to obtain the global minimum of constrained optimization problem. A salient feature of this algorithm is that extreme eigenvector of the Hessian matrix can be obtained without direct computation of the matrix. In comparison to the previous methods, the algorithm is more computationally efficient and highly parallelizable, which makes the algorithm more attractive for real time applications. The algorithm is applied for equalization of discrete multitone (DMT) systems for asynchronous digital subscriber line (ADSL) applications.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.761314","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

The second is a Kalman filter combined with the cross-product algorithm, which is applicable when the angular acceleration of the source is approximately constant.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761323/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6375906","conferenceDate":"15-19 March 1999","displayDocTitle":"Cross-product algorithms for source tracking using an EM vector sensor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-product algorithms for source tracking using an EM vector sensor","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00761323.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036304S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"16398","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6110","citationCount":"1","articleId":"761323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":761328,"authors":[{"name":"K.E.

In many applications it is of great interest to accurately estimate the intensities underlying observed Poisson data. In particular, this work is motivated by photon-limited imaging problems. This paper studies a new Bayesian approach to Poisson intensity estimation based on the Haar wavelet transform. It is shown that the Haar transform provides a very natural and powerful framework for this problem. Using this framework, a novel multiscale Bayesian prior to model intensity functions is devised. The new prior leads to a simple Bayesian intensity estimation procedure. Furthermore, we characterize the correlation behavior of the new prior and show that it has 1/f spectral characteristics.

However, image processing practice has shown that universal thresholding methods are outperformed by simple Bayesian estimators assuming independent wavelet coefficients and heavy-tailed priors such as generalized Gaussian distributions (GGDs). In this paper, we investigate various connections between shrinkage methods and maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation using such priors. In particular, we state a simple condition under which MAP estimates are sparse. We also introduce a new family of complexity priors based upon Rissanen's universal prior on integers. One particular estimator in this class outperforms conventional estimators based on earlier applications of the minimum description length (MDL) principle. We develop analytical expressions for the shrinkage rules implied by GGD and complexity priors. This allows us to show the equivalence between universal hard thresholding, MAP estimation using a very heavy-tailed GGD, and MDL estimation using one of the new complexity priors. Theoretical analysis supported by numerous practical experiments shows the robustness of some of these estimates against mis-specifications of the prior-a basic concern in image processing applications.","doi":"10.1109/18.761332","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel4/18/16471/00761332.pdf","startPage":"909","endPage":"919","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.761332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16471","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of multiresolution image denoising schemes using generalized Gaussian and complexity priors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=761332","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761332/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of multiresolution image denoising schemes using generalized Gaussian and complexity priors","volume":"45","issue":"3","publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6229664","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of multiresolution image denoising schemes using generalized Gaussian and complexity priors","sourcePdf":"00761332.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042824S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"331","articleId":"761332","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":761337,"authors":[{"name":"R.H.

Both FIR and pole-zero channels are considered. The inherent flexibility of the proposed transceivers is exploited to derive, as special cases, zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean-square error receive filterbanks. The transmit filterbank converts transmission over a frequency-selective fading channel, affected by additive colored noise, into a set of independent flat fading subchannels with uncorrelated noise samples. Two loading algorithms are also developed to distribute transmit power and number of bits across the usable subchannels, while adhering to an upper bound on the bit error rate (BER). Reduction of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) margin required to satisfy the prescribed BER is achieved by coding each subchannel's bit stream. The potential of the proposed transceivers is illustrated and compared to discrete multitone (DMT) with simulated examples.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel4/18/16471/00761338.pdf","startPage":"1019","endPage":"1032","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.761338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.761338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16471","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=761338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Filterbank transceivers optimizing information rate in block transmissions over dispersive channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filter bank","Transceivers","Information rates","Additive noise","Bit error rate","Finite impulse response filter","Colored noise","Signal to noise ratio","Data communication","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","transceivers","optimisation","dispersive channels","FIR filters","Gaussian noise","poles and zeros","least mean squares methods","fading channels","error statistics","intersymbol interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block transmissions","dispersive channels","filterbank transceivers","optimal FIR transmit filterbanks","optimal FIR receive filterbanks","finite impulse response","block-based data transmissions","frequency-selective additive Gaussian noise channels","mutual information","fixed transmit-power constraint","pole-zero channel","FIR channel","zero-forcing receive filterbanks","minimum mean-square error receive filterbanks","frequency-selective fading channel","additive colored noise","independent flat fading subchannels","uncorrelated noise samples","loading algorithms","upper bound","bit error rate","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR margin","discrete multitone","DMT","simulation","intersymbol interference","power allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761338/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","displayDocTitle":"Filterbank transceivers optimizing information rate in block transmissions over dispersive channels","volume":"45","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6229670","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Filterbank transceivers optimizing information rate in block transmissions over dispersive channels","sourcePdf":"00761338.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064387S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"203","articleId":"761338","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":761341,"authors":[{"name":"B.M.

However, this approach is limited to linear arrays because of the required Toeplitz structure for the CSM. This paper generalizes this technique to arrays of arbitrary geometry: the developed method is referred to as rectification. It proceeds by searching first for a vector subspace of Hermitian matrices that contains the manifold generated by the CSMs when the angle of arrival varies: this preliminary step is performed only one time for a given array geometry. Next, rectification of estimated CSMs is achieved by projecting them onto this subspace, resulting in denoising and increased resolving power of source localization methods at a very low computational cost. As a by product, the storage requirements for the CSMs are greatly reduced.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.761351","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

Our algorithm preserves all good properties of MODE, such as asymptotic efficiency, excellent performance in scenarios with coherent sources, as well as a reasonable computational cost. Similarly to root-MODE, the proposed method does not require any global multidimensional optimization since it is based on a combination of polynomial rooting and a simple combinatorial search. Our technique is referred to as MODEX (MODE with EXtra roots) because it makes use of a certain polynomial with a larger degree than that of the conventional MODE-polynomial. The source DOAs are estimated via checking a certain (enlarged) number of candidate DOAs using either the stochastic or the deterministic maximum likelihood function. To reduce the computational cost of MODEX, a priori information about source localization sectors can be exploited.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16398","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1999.761352","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

We illustrate the results for a Gaussian mixture PDF, and present simulation results comparing five direction finding algorithms.

Antenna arrays have been shown to provide spatial diversity and cancel undesired signals. In this paper we consider the synergy of both multiuser detection and antenna arrays for the base station of a CDMA system. The receiver we proposed consists of the known multiuser decorrelator, which cancels multiple-access interferences followed by a beamformer for each user, which cancels the external interferences. This receiver adds an extra branch to the decorrelator. This additional branch, corresponding to a fictitious user with an unused code and zero power, allows to estimate the external interference signal subspace and compute a suitable beamforming weight-vector that cancels the external interferences.

After we estimate the desired spatio-frequency signal vector, we propose the 2D unitary ESPRIT algorithm as our estimator which provides closed-form as well as automatically paired AOA-delay estimates. We effectively have a single snapshot of 2D data and thus require 2D smoothing for extracting multiple snapshots. The comparative performance of two 2D smoothing schemes, pre-eigenanalysis and post-eigenanalysis 2D smoothing, is discussed. The space-time data model for the IS-95 uplink is presented. The performance of a reduced dimension space-time RAKE receiver for the IS-95 uplink using the AOA-delay estimates is assessed through Monte-Carlo simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

In several applications the underlying equivalent discrete-time mathematical model is that of a MIMO linear system where the number of inputs equals the number of users (sources) and the number of outputs is related to the number of sensors and the sampling rate. Previously we investigated the structure of multi-step linear predictors for IIR/FIR MIMO systems with irreducible transfer functions and derived an upper bound on its length (Tugnait 1998). In the past multi-step linear predictors have been considered in the literature only for single-input multiple-output models. In this paper we apply the results of Tugnait (1998) for blind equalization of MIMO channels using MMSE linear equalizers. Extensions to the case where the \"subchannel\" transfer functions have common zeros/factors is also investigated. An illustrative simulation example is provided.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.761381","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing. Proceedings.

RAPPID (\"Revolving Asynchronous Pentium(R) Processor Instruction Decoder\"), a prototype IA32 instruction length decoding and steering unit, was implemented using self-timed techniques. RAPPID chip was fabricated on a 0.25 /spl mu/ CMOS process and tested successfully. Results show significant advantages-in particular, performance of 2.5-4.5 instructions/nS-with manageable risks using this design technology. RAPPID achieves three times the throughput and half the latency, dissipating only half the power and requiring about the same area as an existing 400 MHz clocked circuit.","doi":"10.1109/ASYNC.1999.761523","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The approach analyzes finite net unfoldings to derive closed-form expressions for lower and upper bounds on the average TSE, which can be efficiently evaluated using standard statistical methods. The mean of the derived upper and lower bounds thus provides an estimate of the average TSE which has a well-defined error bound. Moreover, we can often make the error arbitrarily small by analyzing larger net unfoldings at the cost of additional run-time. Experiments on several asynchronous systems demonstrate the quality of our estimate and the efficiency of the technique. The experiments include the performance analysis of a full-scale Petri net model of Intel's asynchronous instruction length decoding and steering unit RAPPID containing over 900 transitions and 500 places.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761526/","accessionNumber":"6415611","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-21 April 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Bounding average time separations of events in stochastic timed Petri nets with choice","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bounding average time separations of events in stochastic timed Petri nets with choice","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"00761526.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047084S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"16474","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6163","citationCount":"14","articleId":"761526","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":761541,"authors":[{"name":"J.Y.

Virtual recovery affords an opportunity to previsualize alternatives and to repeat processes, reducing the possibility for such errors and adding new flexibility. Third, virtual artifacts can be shared across a network and/or delivered in the context of multimedia presentations.

We suggest that the thermochemical (linear E) model and the hole-induced (1/E) model can be unified in one model. Based on the unified model, a wide range of TDDB data from different sources were examined and shown to behave consistently. Temperature and stress field dependencies are treated together in the model so that the lifetime is a single-valued function of temperature and field. The criterion for screen/ramp breakdown test is also discussed with the model. Furthermore, the unified model accounts for the effect of gross defects, which limit the oxide reliability in real ICs. The model is be used to predict the 10-year lifetime breakdown field or acceptable oxide thickness for a given voltage, and results suggest that further refinements for thin oxide (<5 nm) are necessary.","doi":"10.1109/RELPHY.1999.761591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16472","startPage":"47","endPage":"51","pdfPath":"/iel4/6161/16472/00761591.pdf","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium Proceedings. 37th Annual (Cat.

This was supported by the discovery of synchronized neural activities. In cat and monkey visual cortex which occurred stimulus dependent either oscillatory (30-100 Hz) or nonrhythmical, internally generated or stimulus dominated. The area in visual space covered by receptive fields of an actually synchronized assembly of neurons was termed the \"linking field\". The present paper aims at relating signals of stimulus dependent synchronization and desynchronization, observed by the authors in the visual cortex of monkeys, with models of basic neural circuits explaining the measured signals and extending the authors' former linking field model. The circuits include: (1) a model neuron with the capability of fast mutual spike linking and decoupling which does not degrade the receptive field properties; (2) linking connections for fast synchronization in neighboring assemblies driven by the same stimulus; (3) feedback inhibition in local assemblies via a common interneuron subserving synchronization, desynchronization, and suppression of uncorrelated signals; and (4) common-input connectivity among members of local and distant assemblies supporting zero-delay phase difference in distributed assemblies. Other recently observed cortical effects that potentially support scene segmentation are shortly reviewed to stimulate further ideas for models. Finally, the linking field hypothesis is critically discussed, including contradictory psychophysical work and new supportive neurophysiological evidence.","doi":"10.1109/72.761705","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/16479/00761705.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.761705","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","startPage":"464","endPage":"479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural mechanisms of scene segmentation: recordings from the visual cortex suggest basic circuits for linking field models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=761705","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","displayDocTitle":"Neural mechanisms of scene segmentation: recordings from the visual cortex suggest basic circuits for linking field models","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761705/","volume":"10","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6256982","pubMedId":"18252546","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural mechanisms of scene segmentation: recordings from the visual cortex suggest basic circuits for linking field models","sourcePdf":"00761705.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082059S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16479","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"112","articleId":"761705","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":761706,"authors":[{"name":"J.L.

We show, however, that a huge class of biophysically detailed and biologically plausible neural-network models can be transformed into a canonical pulse-coupled form by a piece-wise continuous, possibly noninvertible, change of variables. Such transformations exist when a network satisfies a number of conditions; e,g., it is weakly connected; the neurons are Class 1 excitable (i.e., they can generate action potentials with an arbitrary small frequency); and the synapses between neurons are conventional (i.e., axo-dendritic and axe-somatic). Thus, the difference between studying the pulse-coupled model and Hodgkin-Huxley-type neural networks is just a matter of a coordinate change. Therefore, any piece of information about the pulse-coupled model is valuable since it tells something about all weakly connected networks of Class 1 neurons. For example, we show that the pulse-coupled network of identical neurons does not synchronize in-phase. This confirms Ermentrout's (1996) result that weakly connected Class 1 neurons are difficult to synchronize, regardless of the equations that describe dynamics of each cell.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.761707","doi":"10.1109/72.761707","startPage":"499","endPage":"507","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/16479/00761707.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=761707","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761707/","displayDocTitle":"Class 1 neural excitability, conventional synapses, weakly connected networks, and mathematical foundations of pulse-coupled models","volume":"10","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"6249666","pubMedId":"18252548","publicationDate":"May 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Class 1 neural excitability, conventional synapses, weakly connected networks, and mathematical foundations of pulse-coupled models","sourcePdf":"00761707.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066936S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16479","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"86","articleId":"761707","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":761708,"authors":[{"name":"E.M.

Using the phase model, we can predict whether a given pulse-coupled network has oscillatory associative memory, or what minimal adjustments should be made so that it can acquire memory. In the search for such minimal adjustments we obtain a large class of simple pulse-coupled neural networks that ran memorize and reproduce synchronized temporal patterns the same way a Hopfield network does with static patterns.

Simulation of a vision system with millions of pulse-coded model neurons, however, is almost impossible on the basis of available processors including parallel processors and neurocomputers. A \"one-to-one\" silicon implementation of pulse-coded model neurons suffers from communication problems and low flexibility. On the other hand, acceleration of the simulation algorithm of pulse-coded leaky integrator neurons has proved to be straightforward, flexible, and very efficient. Thus we decided to develop an accelerator for a special version of the French and Stein (1970) neurons with modulatory inputs which are advantageous for simulation of synchronization mechanisms. Moreover, our accelerator also provides a Hebbian-like learning rule and supports adaptivity. Up to 128 K neurons with a total number of 16 M freely allocatable synapses are simulated within one system. The size of networks, however, is not at all limited by these numbers as the system may be arbitrarily expanded. Simulation speed obviously depends on the number of interconnections and on the average activity within the network. In the case of locally interconnected networks for simulation of vision mechanisms there is only a very low percentage of simultaneously active neurons: stimuli are not simultaneously presented in all orientations and at all positions of the visual field. In these cases our accelerator provides close to real-time behavior if one second of a biological neuron is simulated by 1000 time slots.","doi":"10.1109/72.761709","startPage":"527","endPage":"538","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/16479/00761709.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.761709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An accelerator for neural networks with pulse-coded model neurons","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Neurons","Biological system modeling","Labeling","Encoding","Visual system","Machine vision","Silicon","Acceleration","Biological information theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","computer vision","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerator","pulse-coded model neurons","synchronization","spikes","encoding scheme","visual system","leaky integrator neurons","Hebbian-like learning rule","adaptivity","freely allocatable synapses","simulation speed","locally interconnected networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761709/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","displayDocTitle":"An accelerator for neural networks with pulse-coded model neurons","volume":"10","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6249668","pubMedId":"18252550","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An accelerator for neural networks with pulse-coded model neurons","sourcePdf":"00761709.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101856S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16479","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"12","articleId":"761709","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":761710,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Their eyes move about points of interest within the image collecting clues as to the content of the image. Object shape is one of the driving forces of foveation. These foveation points are generally corners and, to a lesser extent, the edges. The pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN) has the inherent ability to segment an image. The corners and edges of the PCNN segments are similar to the foveation points. Thus, it is a natural extension of PCNN technology to use it as a foveation engine.

We use a combination of two different approaches for linear ICA: Comon's information theoretic approach and the projection pursuit approach. Using maximum entropy approximations of differential entropy, we introduce a family of new contrast functions for ICA. These contrast functions enable both the estimation of the whole decomposition by minimizing mutual information, and estimation of individual independent components as projection pursuit directions. The statistical properties of the estimators based on such contrast functions are analyzed under the assumption of the linear mixture model, and it is shown how to choose contrast functions that are robust and/or of minimum variance.

We suggest how these synapses can be embedded in fully self-organizing networks to generate orthogonal nonlinear components and be used for multidimensional approximation.","doi":"10.1109/72.761723","startPage":"635","endPage":"644","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/16479/00761723.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.761723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inhibitory synapses in neural networks with sigmoidal nonlinearities","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Neural networks","Biological neural networks","Neurons","Biological information theory","Independent component analysis","Self-organizing networks","Multidimensional systems","Least squares approximation","Hebbian theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","Hebbian learning","approximation theory","self-adjusting systems","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","sigmoidal nonlinearities","anti Hebbian synapses","self-organizing networks","multidimensional approximation","inhibitory synapses","Hebbian learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761723/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","displayDocTitle":"Inhibitory synapses in neural networks with sigmoidal nonlinearities","volume":"10","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6249677","pubMedId":"18252564","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inhibitory synapses in neural networks with sigmoidal nonlinearities","sourcePdf":"00761723.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101761S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16479","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"1","articleId":"761723","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":761724,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This paper also proposes a supervised learning algorithm based on gradient descent for training reformulated RBF neural networks constructed using the proposed approach. A sensitivity analysis of the proposed algorithm relates the properties of RBFs with the convergence of gradient descent learning. Experiments involving a variety of reformulated RBF networks generated by linear and exponential generator functions indicate that gradient descent learning is simple, easily implementable, and produces RBF networks that perform considerably better than conventional RBF models trained by existing algorithms.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/16479/00761725.pdf","startPage":"657","endPage":"671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reformulated radial basis neural networks trained by gradient descent","doi":"10.1109/72.761725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.761725","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=761725","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761725/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","displayDocTitle":"Reformulated radial basis neural networks trained by gradient descent","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6256988","pubMedId":"18252566","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reformulated radial basis neural networks trained by gradient descent","sourcePdf":"00761725.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037278S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16479","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"197","articleId":"761725","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":761726,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The core of the model is a two-layer oscillator network that performs stream segregation on the basis of oscillatory correlation. In the oscillatory correlation framework, a stream is represented by a population of synchronized relaxation oscillators, each of which corresponds to an auditory feature, and different streams are represented by desynchronized oscillator populations. Lateral connections between oscillators encode harmonicity, and proximity in frequency and time. Prior to the oscillator network are a model of the auditory periphery and a stage in which mid-level auditory representations are formed. The model has been systematically evaluated using a corpus of voiced speech mixed with interfering sounds, and produces improvements in terms of signal-to-noise ratio for every mixture.

The maximum clique approach albeit being near O(1) in complexity, is limited in its use for small problem sizes, since it only partitions the data based on the compatibility between the microoperations, and does not minimize the cost function. We thereby use this approach to condition the data initially (to form compatibility classes), and then use the proposed second method to optimize the cost function. The latter method is then able to discover better solutions than other schemes for the benchmark data set.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761728/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6249679","pubMedId":"18252569","volume":"10","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Microcode optimization with neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microcode optimization with neural networks","sourcePdf":"00761728.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066101S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16479","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"6","articleId":"761728","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":761729,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The model is derived from Newton-Euler equations by assuming that the helicopter body is rigid. First, we show that for several choices of output variables exact input-output linearization fails to linearize the whole state space and results in having unstable zero dynamics. By neglecting the couplings between moments and forces, we show that the approximated system with dynamic decoupling is full state linearizable by choosing positions and heading as outputs. We prove that bounded tracking is achieved by applying the approximate control. Next, we derive a diffeomorphism showing that an approximation of the system is differentially flat, thus state trajectory and nominal inputs can be generated from a given output trajectory. Simulation results using both output tracking controllers based on exact and approximate input-output linearization are presented for comparison.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1998.761745","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 37th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (Cat.

Procedures for bidding and market clearing are described. The market clearing process handles the spinning reserve requirements and power balance simultaneously. The method is used on a standard unit commitment problem with minimum up/down times, start-up costs and spinning reserve requirement taken into account. Comparisons with solutions provided by Lagrangian relaxation, genetic algorithms and Chao-an Li's unit decommitment procedure demonstrate the potential benefits of this new method. The motivation for this work was to design a competitive electricity market suitable for thermal generation scheduling. However, performance in simulations of the proposed market has been so good that it is presented here as a solving technique for the unit commitment problem.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/59/16488/00761868.pdf","startPage":"472","endPage":"477","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/59.761868","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.761868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16488","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=761868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal power generation scheduling by simulated competition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power generation","Spinning","Power markets","Cost function","Electricity supply industry","Power generation economics","Electricity supply industry deregulation","Power system analysis computing","Power system economics","Power system simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electricity supply industry","thermal power stations","power generation scheduling","power generation dispatch","power generation economics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["competitive electricity market","thermal power generation scheduling","simulated competition","unit commitment","power exchange","bidding","market clearing","spinning reserve requirements","power balance","simulation performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","displayDocTitle":"Thermal power generation scheduling by simulated competition","volume":"14","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6248900","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal power generation scheduling by simulated competition","sourcePdf":"00761868.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039909S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"36","articleId":"761868","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":761869,"authors":[{"name":"T.E.

The objective function is defined as incremental losses divided by incremental load served. A simplified loss formula is used to screen candidate switches, but a full load flow after each actual switch closing maintains accurate loss and constraint information. A backtracking option mitigates the algorithm's greedy search. This algorithm takes more computer time than other methods, but it models constraints and control action more accurately. A network load flow is used to provide a lower bound on the losses.

The proposed approach uses genetic algorithms (GA) to search for optimal settings of rule-based power system stabilizer (RBPSS) parameters. Incorporation of GA in RBPSSs design will add an intelligent dimension to these stabilizers and significantly reduce the time consumed in the design process. It is shown in this paper that the performance of RBPSS can be improved significantly by incorporating a genetic-based learning mechanism. The performance of the proposed GRBPSS under different disturbances and loading conditions is investigated for a single machine infinite bus system and two multimachine power systems. The results show the superiority of the proposed GRBPSS as compared to both conventional lead-lag PSS (CPSS) and classical RBPSS. The capability of the proposed GRBPSS to damp out the local as well as the interarea modes of oscillations is also demonstrated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/59/16488/00761886.pdf","startPage":"600","endPage":"607","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/59.761886","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.761886","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16488","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=761886","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybridizing rule-based power system stabilizers with genetic algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hybrid power systems","Genetic algorithms","Power system dynamics","Power system modeling","Power system stability","Power systems","Petroleum","Minerals","Process design","Learning systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system stability","power system control","control system synthesis","optimal control","genetic algorithms","knowledge based systems","control system analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid genetic rule-based power system stabilizer","genetic algorithms","PSS","genetic-based learning mechanism","performance","disturbances","control design","loading conditions","multimachine power systems","interarea oscillation modes","optimal settings","control simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761886/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","displayDocTitle":"Hybridizing rule-based power system stabilizers with genetic algorithms","volume":"14","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6248918","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybridizing rule-based power system stabilizers with genetic algorithms","sourcePdf":"00761886.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034586S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"49","articleId":"761886","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":761887,"authors":[{"name":"O.

From simulation tests on a sample power system, it reveals that the proposed tool can yield a highly successful prediction rate in real-time.","doi":"10.1109/59.761898","startPage":"685","endPage":"692","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.761898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16488","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/59/16488/00761898.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of a novel fuzzy neural network to real-time transient stability swings prediction based on synchronized phasor measurements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761898/","displayDocTitle":"Application of a novel fuzzy neural network to real-time transient stability swings prediction based on synchronized phasor measurements","volume":"14","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6248930","publicationDate":"May 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of a novel fuzzy neural network to real-time transient stability swings prediction based on synchronized phasor measurements","sourcePdf":"00761898.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035079S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"98","articleId":"761898","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":761902,"authors":[{"name":"Xihui Yan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Xihui Yan","id":"37364692900"},{"name":"V.H.

The nonlinear OPF problem is solved by a predictor-corrector primal-dual log-barrier (PCPDLB) method as a sequence of linearized sub-problems. Besides discussing the problem formulation, the paper offers a detailed description of the PCPDLB algorithm; it also addresses several implementation issues such as the determination of barrier parameter and the customization of initial points for OPF problems. In addition, practical issues on how to choose linear step sizes and convergence criteria are investigated to evaluate their impact on the performance of the algorithm. Some heuristics of dynamically adjusting step sizes and tolerance are proposed which significantly improve OPF solution speed. Computational results on power systems of 118 and 1062 buses are presented and discussed. Comparisons with other variants of primal-dual log-barrier methods are also provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed predictor-corrector interior point algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/59.761902","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","startPage":"709","endPage":"717","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/59/16488/00761902.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.761902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16488","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving an interior-point-based OPF by dynamic adjustments of step sizes and tolerances","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load flow","Power systems","Linear programming","Power system reliability","Power engineering and energy","Reactive power","Power engineering computing","Power system dynamics","Prediction algorithms","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power systems","load flow","predictor-corrector methods","reactive power","load dispatching","linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interior-point-based optimal power flow","step sizes dynamic adjustments","tolerances dynamic adjustments","real power dispatch","reactive power dispatch","predictor-corrector primal-dual log-barrier method","linearized sub-problems","linear step sizes","convergence criteria","1062 bus power system","118 bus power system","primal-dual log-barrier methods","predictor-corrector interior point algorithm","successive linear programming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","displayDocTitle":"Improving an interior-point-based OPF by dynamic adjustments of step sizes and tolerances","volume":"14","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6248933","publicationDate":"May 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761902/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving an interior-point-based OPF by dynamic adjustments of step sizes and tolerances","sourcePdf":"00761902.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055432S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"121","articleId":"761902","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":761903,"authors":[{"name":"H.R.

It has been shown that normal load has a stationary characteristic and can be modeled by back propagation neural networks. The weather sensitive load has been modeled by a set of three fuzzy logic systems trained by least square estimation of an optimal fuzzy basis function coefficient.

Using Benders decomposition, the formulation is decomposed into a master problem and a subproblem. The master problem solves unit commitment with prevailing constraints, except transmission security and voltage constraints, by augmented Lagrangian relaxation. The subproblem minimizes violations of transmission security and voltage constraints for a commitment schedule given in the master problem. Since transmission constraints are decoupled from voltage constraints in the subproblem, the subproblem could further be decomposed into two smaller subproblems. The resulting transmission subproblem minimizes transmission flow violations for the worst contingency case by adjusting unit generation and phase shifter controls. The corresponding reactive subproblem minimizes voltage constraints by reactive power generation and tap changing controls. In the case of transmission flow or voltage infeasibility, Benders cuts are produced for unit commitment rescheduling. The iterative process between the master problem and the subproblems provides a minimum production cost solution for generation scheduling while satisfying the constraints. A comprehensive unit commitment software package is developed using Visual C++. A 36-unit system in the IEEE-118 bus network is used to demonstrate the efficiency of the method.","doi":"10.1109/59.761909","startPage":"757","endPage":"764","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/59/16488/00761909.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.761909","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16488","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unit commitment with transmission security and voltage constraints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Security","Load flow","Lagrangian functions","Phase shifters","Reactive power control","Power generation","Voltage control","Production","Costs","Software packages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power generation scheduling","power system analysis computing","power system security","power transmission","relaxation","reactive power","load flow","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unit commitment","transmission security","voltage constraints","optimal power flow","Benders decomposition","master problem","subproblem","augmented Lagrangian relaxation","transmission flow violations minimisation","worst contingency case","unit generation adjustment","phase shifter controls","reactive power generation","tap changing controls","transmission flow","voltage infeasibility","Benders cuts","unit commitment rescheduling","iterative process","minimum production cost solution","generation scheduling","software package","Visual C++","36-unit system","IEEE-118 bus network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/761909/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","displayDocTitle":"Unit commitment with transmission security and voltage constraints","volume":"14","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6248940","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unit commitment with transmission security and voltage constraints","sourcePdf":"00761909.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037845S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"143","articleId":"761909","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":761911,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

Generally, hysteresis nonlinearity exists in the piezoelectric actuator, which may cause undesirable inaccuracy. Based on solutions of a general hysteresis model, an approximation function is introduced to compensate for effects of the hysteresis nonlinearities. This approximation function is implemented by fuzzy logic method, which is expressed as a series expansion of basis functions. Combining this approximation function with adaptive control techniques, an intelligent control algorithm is developed. As a result, global asymptotic stability of the system is established in the Lyapunov sense.

For periodic inputs, hysteresis can be approximated by a phaser with a negative phase shift opening the possibility of cascade compensation. Since in actual hysteresis the phase shift varies according to the size of the input, giving rise to minor loops, the possibility exists to handle the compensation of minor loops by using phasors which vary the phase shift according to the magnitude of the input in an inverse fashion. In this paper, this technique is applied to the compensation of a piezoelectric actuator.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1998.761985","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 37th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (Cat.

Through a coordinate transformation the model is put in a triangular-like form which makes it possible to use integrator backstepping to develop a tracking control law.

Several authors have already proposed experimental characterizations using sets of test devices. One of the main difficulties of this experimental approach is the accuracy of both the geometrical and electrical measurements. On the other hand, precise numerical methods have been developed to advantageously replace experiments. Generally speaking, these methods are CPU time consuming. However, due to the continuing improvement of computer power, they are becoming more and more time efficient when applied to the analysis of SAW filters. The overall efficiency depends on the numerical integration methods used. In this paper we present a review of the numerical programs that have been developed during the past few years. For both infinite and finite grating modeling, we developed numerical mixed FEM/BEM (Finite Element Method-Boundary Element Method) models using an efficient interpolation function basis that takes into account the singularity at both edges of each electrode. First we propose a model for the simulation of finite transducers with arbitrary geometries. This numerical code has been successfully used to analyze a SPUDT (Single Phase UniDirectional Transducer) on the Y+36/spl deg/ cut of LiTaO/sub 3/. For an infinite periodic grating, it is convenient to solve the propagation problem in the Fourier domain (wave number space and harmonic excitation) and important efforts have been spent to properly integrate the so-called periodic harmonic Green's function. Using this numerical model together with the general P-matrix formalism, it is possible to compute all the basic parameters with a very good accuracy: these consist of the single strip reflectivity, acoustic wave-phase velocity, and phase offset between reflection and transduction centers. Simulations and comparisons with experiments are shown for each model.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.1998.762125","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium. Proceedings (Cat.

SAW profiles at frequencies up to 1 GHz are obtained with our interferometer. Fast automatic computer control enables high-resolution scans with a large number of measuring points at speeds up to 10 000 points/hour. Our interferometer can detect below one Angstrom vibrations of the surface. These capabilities have been utilized to scan modern SAW devices. The SAW beam in a SPUDT filter has been studied. In addition, a new acoustic loss mechanism has been detected in SAW resonators operating at 1 GHz via probing an IEF filter. Our measurements serve to unfold the direct connection between the acoustic losses present at selected frequencies and the corresponding increased insertion loss of the filter at these frequencies.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.1998.762135","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium.

By using weighted chirps to reduce the sidelobes of the compressed pulse to -22 dB, /spl pi//4 DQPSK modulation as well as overlapping chirp signals, we get a data rate of more than 70 Mb/s. Considering a channel as suggested in the IEEE 802.11 standard for the indoor environment we achieve an improvement of the bit-error-rate (BER) over traditional /spl pi//4 DQPSK modulation because of the processing gain due to the pulse compression.

In order to successfully detect and classify flaw echoes from high scattering grain echoes, an efficient and robust method is required. This paper utilizes split-spectrum processing (SSP) combined with a neural network (NN) to develop a dedicated ultrasonic detection system. SSP displays signal diversity (i.e., correlated or uncorrelated), and the neural network (NN) performs highly complex nonlinear mapping by which signals can be classified according to their feature vectors. Therefore, the combination of SSP and NN (SSP-NN) presents a powerful technique for ultrasonic NDE. In this paper, SSP is achieved by using Gaussian bandpass filters. Then, an adaptive three layer neural network using a backpropagation learning process is applied to perform the classification processing of frequency diverse data. Both simulated and experimental data are used to test this method, and results show that SSP-NN shows an excellent sensitivity in detecting and separating adjacent flaw echoes and is able to detect flaw echoes when the flaw-to-clutter ratio is about 0 dB.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/762278/","accessionNumber":"6396442","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear signal processing for ultrasonic target detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear signal processing for ultrasonic target detection","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"00762278.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028369S","chronDate":"1998","isNumber":"16493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6171","citationCount":"5","articleId":"762278","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":762296,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In particular, using this design technique, the overall frequency variation of a nickel-plated micromechanical resonator over a 27/spl deg/C to 117/spl deg/C range has been reduced from 2519 ppm to 342 ppm, and zero TC/sub f/ points have been introduced at temperatures ranging from 27/spl deg/C to 57/spl deg/C, specifiable by design. In the preparation of micromechanical devices, localized rapid thermal annealing was found to greatly increase the Q (>13000) and drift stability of the nickel resonators used in this work.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.1998.762298","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium.

Many DELPHI principles and results have been extensively discussed in open literature over the last five years (e.g. Rosten et al. 1997; Lasance et al. 1997); however, one of the topics that has not been treated in sufficient detail is the creation and evaluation or the compact models themselves. This paper tries to fill this gap. We have shown that a dedicated optimisation tool can have the potential to create models and to investigate the consequences of changing the model or the set of boundary conditions. It paves the way to thermal data-on-demand, a procedure by which a supplier provides the end-user with a model that is either suitable for all applications or tuned to a specific application, in almost real time.","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifteenth Annual IEEE Semiconductor Thermal Measurement and Management Symposium (Cat.

The methods were improved for practical application and extended to all IC package types. Test parts were chosen to cover as wide as possible a range of different plastic packages currently in use, including comparison of Alloy 42 (FeNi42) and Cu-based leadframe material, as well as a large and a small chip inside the same package, standard and thermally enhanced power devices, DSO, QFP and BGA packages. For all device types investigated, it was possible to generate simple resistor networks which reproduce junction temperatures and fluxes of a detailed finite element model for all 38 boundary conditions suggested in DELPHI with an average accuracy of 1-2%. Maximum errors are in general about 10% or less. As result of the SEED project, methods for thermal characterization of active components are available, which not only work in practice, but are also robust and low cost, because no test PCB is needed for measurements. Physically, they are much better suited to model validations than existing thermal resistance measurements. The resulting thermal resistor network allows end users for the first time to routinely predict the junction temperatures of components in their specific applications with an acceptable accuracy. The final goal of a simple and universal thermal characterization of electronic components is achieved. Standardization and adoption is in progress.","doi":"10.1109/STHERM.1999.762449","publicationTitle":"Fifteenth Annual IEEE Semiconductor Thermal Measurement and Management Symposium (Cat.

This can be done by giving a manipulator hand sensors that provide information about the progress of interactions with the environment. A method is presented for controlling both the position of a manipulator and the contact forces generated at the hand. This hybrid controller has the feature of permitting trajectories to be specified in a convenient Cartesian coordinate system, while offering advantages over the existing approximate \"free joint\" methods. An experimental implementation of the controller was developed and used to control two joints of a modified Scheinman manipulator equipped with a wrist mounted force sensor. Data from this implementation are presented along with the results from a simple simulation.","doi":"10.1109/CMPSAC.1979.762539","publicationTitle":"COMPSAC 79. Proceedings.

Consequently, these heuristics do not scale well and cannot handle problems of moderate sizes. A natural approach to reducing complexity, while aiming for a similar or potentially better solution, is to parallelize the scheduling algorithm. This can be done by partitioning the task graphs and concurrently generating partial schedules for the partitioned parts, which are then concatenated to obtain the final schedule. The problem, however, is nontrivial as there exists dependencies among the nodes of a task graph which must be preserved for generating a valid schedule. Moreover, the time clock for scheduling is global for all the processors (that are executing the parallel scheduling algorithm), making the inherent parallelism invisible. In this paper, we introduce a parallel algorithm that is guided by a systematic partitioning of the task graph to perform scheduling using multiple processors. The algorithm schedules both the tasks and messages, and is suitable for graphs with arbitrary computation and communication costs, and is applicable to systems with arbitrary network topologies using homogeneous or heterogeneous processors. We have implemented the algorithm on the Intel Paragon and compared it with three closely related algorithms. The experimental results indicate that our algorithm yields higher quality solutions while using an order of magnitude smaller scheduling times. The algorithm also exhibits an interesting trade-off between the solution quality and speedup while scaling well with the problem size.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/762819/","volume":"10","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"6249687","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On parallelizing the multiprocessor scheduling problem","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On parallelizing the multiprocessor scheduling problem","sourcePdf":"00762819.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059039S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"39","articleId":"762819","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":762822,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A modified version of this floating-point adder can perform accumulation in 2-cycles with a small amount of extra hardware for use in a parallel processor node. This is achieved by feeding back the previous un-normalised but correctly rounded result together with the normalisation distance.

Central tools for achieving system security are cryptographic algorithms. For performance as well as for physical security reasons, it is often advantageous to realize cryptographic algorithms in hardware. In order to overcome the well-known drawback of reduced flexibility that is associated with traditional ASIC solutions, this contribution proposes arithmetic architectures which are optimized for modern field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The proposed architectures perform modular exponentiation with very long integers. This operation is at the heart of many practical public-key algorithms such as RSA and discrete logarithm schemes. We combine the Montgomery modular multiplication algorithm with a new systolic array design, which is capable of processing a variable number of bits per array cell. The designs are flexible, allowing any choice of operand and modulus. Unlike previous approaches, we systematically implement and compare several variants of our new architecture for different bit lengths. We provide absolute area and timing measures for each architecture. The results allow conclusions about the feasibility and time-space trade-offs of our architecture for implementation on Xilinx XC4000 series FPGAs. As a major practical result we show that it is possible to implement modular exponentiation at secure bit lengths on a single commercially available FPGA.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 14th IEEE Symposium on Computer Arithmetic (Cat.

Multiplication and division therefore proceed in minimal time with no rounding error. However, the system can only offer an overall advantage if addition and subtraction can be performed with speed and accuracy at least equal to that of floating-paint, but these operations require the interpolation of a non-linear function which has hitherto been either time-consuming or inaccurate. We present a procedure by which additions and subtractions can be performed rapidly and accurately, and show that these operations are thereby competitive with their floating-point equivalents. We then show that the average performance of the logarithmic system exceeds floating-point, in terms of both speed and accuracy.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.1999.762839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16513","startPage":"142","endPage":"151","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 14th IEEE Symposium on Computer Arithmetic (Cat.

As for division, to simplify the selection function, the operands are pre-scaled.

Moreover, the compensation of the variable scale factor is done by computing the logarithm of the scale factor and performing the compensation by an exponential.

The model, which consists of solving sequentially one ordinary differential equation per amplifier, is used to (1) determine power and SNR excursions in the surviving channels along a chain of 35 EDFAs during isolated add-drop events in a 16-channel WDM circuit switching scenario and (2) run Monte Carlo simulations of the first five EDFAs of the same chain fed by burst-mode packet switching traffic on each of the 16 channels. Each packet source is modeled as an ON-OFF asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) source, with ON and OFF times having a heavy-tailed Pareto distribution. The aggregate source model is asymptotically self-similar, and well describes multimedia packet communications. The results are used to examine the influence of average network utilization and source ON-OFF time variance on the probability density function of signal power and SNR at each EDFA output. We demonstrate that self-similar traffic generates sizable power and SNR swings, especially at low network utilization. The simulations also indicate sizable broadening of the power and SNR density functions along the cascade of EDFAs, reaching levels in excess of 9 dBm and 4 dB for the power and SNR swings, respectively, at the 5th EDFA. The effect becomes more pronounced for longer EDFA chains. Such a large broadening may imply serious system impairments in burst-mode WDM packet networks.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.762887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16529","startPage":"733","endPage":"742","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/16529/00762887.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Output power and SNR swings in cascades of EDFAs for circuit- and packet-switched optical networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/762887/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Output power and SNR swings in cascades of EDFAs for circuit- and packet-switched optical networks","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6253918","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Output power and SNR swings in cascades of EDFAs for circuit- and packet-switched optical networks","sourcePdf":"00762887.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08454S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"37","articleId":"762887","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":762892,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

Both the loss and dispersion of the transmission fiber are periodically compensated. Two dispersive elements are placed at the input and output ends of a compensation period, respectively, to compensate for fiber dispersion. The pulse compression owing to self-phase modulation (SPM) can be adjusted by the compensation ratios of the dispersive elements at the two ends of a compensation period. Therefore, the pulse compression can be optimized and the system performance can be improved to compare with the system with either pre- or postdispersion compensation. The rules to design the system are considered. The transmission system of 10-Gb/s bit rate, 9000-km transmission distance, and 100-km compensation period is taken as an example. The second-order fiber dispersion is assumed to be completely compensated. Wave equation is numerically solved to study the system performance which is represented by Q factor. The relations of several system parameters and Q factor are studied. The system parameters include the compensation ratios of the dispersive elements at the two ends of a compensation period, dispersion of transmission fiber, signal power, and the compensation ratios of third-order fiber dispersion. If the third-order fiber dispersion cannot be completely compensated, it is found that one can use a higher signal power to improve the system performance.","doi":"10.1109/50.762893","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/16529/00762893.pdf","startPage":"792","endPage":"798","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.762893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bi-end dispersion compensation for ultralong optical communication system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=762893","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/762893/","displayDocTitle":"Bi-end dispersion compensation for ultralong optical communication system","volume":"17","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6253924","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bi-end dispersion compensation for ultralong optical communication system","sourcePdf":"00762893.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029033S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"7","articleId":"762893","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":762895,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The use of this modulator makes the simpler system configuration possible. Using the downlink testbed, the 5 m-long free-space propagation of subcarrier multiplexed 156 Mb/s-DPSK 60 GHz-band mm-wave signals recovered by optical direct detection is successfully demonstrated. The transmission of the mm-wave signals over 85 km-long standard SMF is also successfully demonstrated, using an optical SSB filtering technique to overcome the fiber dispersion.

Most derivations of the statistics of modal noise assume a limiting case of overfilled launch conditions where there are many modes propagating in the fiber. However, if the transmitted power is contained in a few modes, commonly referred to as restricted-mode launch conditions, the general assumptions for modal noise theory are not valid. Here, we present experimental measurements of the noise distributions for both full- and restricted-mode launch cases and show that the noise statistics for a restricted launch are significantly different than for a full-mode launch. In particular, the variance of the noise distribution is larger than in the over-filled launch case leading to a degradation in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Modifications of existing theory are then used to develop a numerical model for the noise statistics of a restricted-mode launch and good agreement between this model and experimental data is achieved.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modal noise in multimode fibers under restricted launch conditions","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/50.762898","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/16529/00762898.pdf","startPage":"817","endPage":"822","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.762898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16529","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=762898","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/762898/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","displayDocTitle":"Modal noise in multimode fibers under restricted launch conditions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6253928","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modal noise in multimode fibers under restricted launch conditions","sourcePdf":"00762898.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05113S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"32","articleId":"762898","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":762902,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-Jung Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shih-Jung Chang","id":"37367678500"},{"name":"Ching-Long Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Long Tsai","id":"37365843600"},{"name":"Yih-Bin Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yih-Bin Lin","id":"37366765000"},{"name":"Ju-Feng Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ju-Feng Liu","id":"37366731400"},{"name":"Way-Seen Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Way-Seen Wang","id":"37280471700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0733-8724"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2213"}],"articleNumber":"762902","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":228},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Optical Society of America","url":"http://www.osa.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society","url":"http://taes.msubmit.net/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/im/imnew/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://mtt.org/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=762902","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrooptic modulators","Optical waveguides","Optical modulation","Wet etching","Electrodes","Voltage","Electrooptical waveguides","Optical waveguide theory","Waveguide discontinuities","Dry etching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lithium compounds","electro-optical modulation","ridge waveguides","optical waveguides","electrodes","integrated optics","optical fabrication","etching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrooptic modulator","ridge structure","X-cut LiNbO/sub 3/","ridge-type Mach-Zehnder modulator","wet etching optical fabrication","proton-exchange pretreatment","drive voltage","overlap integral","numerical simulation","electrode","optical waveguide","LiNbO/sub 3/"]}],"abstract":"A ridge-type Mach-Zehnder modulator on X-cut LiNbO/sub 3/ is fabricated by wet etching with proton-exchange pretreatment.

The electrostatically actuated tilt mirrors use an 80 V peak-to-peak 300 KHz sinusoidal drive signal to switch between /spl plusmn/10/spl deg/ with a 20 /spl mu/s response. The total fiber-to-fiber insertion loss for the packaged switch is 5 dB for the passed signals and 8 dB for added and dropped signals, with 0.2 dB polarization dependence. Switching contrast was 30 dB or more for all 16 channels and all input and output states.

Furthermore, in the case of the RPM the propagation constants can be determined with the help of the phase variation of the denominator of the reflection coefficient in conjunction with an optimization procedure. Both methods are tested on numerically \"challenging\" multilayer waveguides such as a two-metal-layer waveguide, a multilayer lossy waveguide, and an ARROW waveguide. The results produced by both methods are in good agreement with other numerical techniques but are obtained without the need for solving a dispersion equation in the complex plane.

The presence of a large number of unprogrammed antifuses in the routing architecture adds to the capacitive loading of each net. Hence, a considerable amount of power is dissipated in the routing architecture, due to signal transitions occurring at the output of logic modules. Based on primary input signal distributions, signal activities at the internal nodes of a circuit are estimated. Placement and routing are then carried out, based on the signal activity measure so as to achieve routability with low power dissipation and required timing. Results show that a more than 40% reduction in power dissipation due to routing capacitances can be achieved, compared to a layout based only on area and timing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/762929/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6257209","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"46","issue":"5","displayDocTitle":"Power-dissipation driven FPGA place and route under timing constraints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-dissipation driven FPGA place and route under timing constraints","sourcePdf":"00762929.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024177S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"16","articleId":"762929","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":762941,"authors":[{"name":"N.S.

However, a direct implementation of such an approach may be prohibitive in many practical situations. We present an algorithm that approximates the above mentioned correlated MAP algorithm by iteratively maximizing the set of posterior marginals. With some simplifying assumptions, expressions for these marginals are then derived, using the principle of minimum cross-entropy. The resulting algorithm is simple, and includes conventional MAP estimation as a special case. The utility of the proposed method is tested in adaptation experiments for an alphabet recognition task.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/16532/00763143.pdf","startPage":"132","endPage":"134","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/97.763143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/97.763143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16532","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=763143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A minimum cross-entropy approach to hidden Markov model adaptation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Iterative algorithms","Testing","Speech recognition","Adaptation model","Laboratories","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","minimum entropy methods","maximum likelihood estimation","correlation methods","speech recognition","Gaussian processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum cross-entropy","hidden Markov model adaptation","adaptation algorithm","optimal maximum a posteriori formulation","Gaussian mixture densities","parameter correlation","sparse adaptation data","correlated MAP algorithm","posterior marginals","MAP estimation","adaptation experiments","alphabet recognition task","speech recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/763143/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1999","displayDocTitle":"A minimum cross-entropy approach to hidden Markov model adaptation","volume":"6","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1999","accessionNumber":"6252841","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A minimum cross-entropy approach to hidden Markov model adaptation","sourcePdf":"00763143.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056778S","chronDate":"June  1999","isNumber":"16532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","articleId":"763143","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":763148,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The validity of the method was proven by experiments. Using the method, the instantaneous and noncontacting measurements of the amplitudes can be realized. Thus, the dynamic measurement of the permittivity becomes possible.","doi":"10.1109/22.763153","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.763153","startPage":"546","endPage":"550","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/16534/00763153.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16534","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Permittivity determination using amplitudes of transmission and reflection coefficients at microwave frequency","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","displayDocTitle":"Permittivity determination using amplitudes of transmission and reflection coefficients at microwave frequency","publicationDate":"May 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"47","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6248132","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/763153/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Permittivity determination using amplitudes of transmission and reflection coefficients at microwave frequency","sourcePdf":"00763153.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030754S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"53","articleId":"763153","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":763156,"authors":[{"name":"Guang-Tsai Lei","affiliation":["Mayo Foundation, Rochester, MN, USA"],"lastName":"Guang-Tsai Lei","id":"37283551700"},{"name":"R.W.

Based on the topology, a series of prototype modules, with 600 V, 3.3 kW rating, were fabricated using an innovative packaging technique developed for the program-metal posts interconnected parallel plate structure (MPIPPS). This new packaging technique uses direct attachment of bulk copper, not wire-bonding of fine aluminum wires, for interconnecting power devices. Electrical performance data of the packaged devices show that an air-cooled 15 kW inverter, operating from 400 V dc bus with 20 kHz switching frequency can be constructed by integrating three prototype modules, which is almost double what could be achieved with commercially packaged devices of the same rating.","doi":"10.1109/6040.763184","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Advanced Packaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Advanced Packaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/6040/16535/00763184.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"144","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/6040.763184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An innovative technique for packaging power electronic building blocks using metal posts interconnected parallel plate structures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=763184","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/763184/","displayDocTitle":"An innovative technique for packaging power electronic building blocks using metal posts interconnected parallel plate structures","volume":"22","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6254945","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An innovative technique for packaging power electronic building blocks using metal posts interconnected parallel plate structures","sourcePdf":"00763184.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031627S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6040","citationCount":"53","articleId":"763184","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":763203,"authors":[{"name":"R.H.

The authors approach can be used for designing decentralized controllers and is easily extended to H/sub 2/, H/sub /spl infin// and mixed H/sub 2//H/sub /spl infin// problems via standard LMI techniques. The continuous- and discrete-time cases are considered and numerical examples are given to illustrate the results.","doi":"10.1109/9.763227","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/16536/00763227.pdf","startPage":"1053","endPage":"1057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.763227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16536","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sufficient LMI conditions for output feedback control problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=763227","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/763227/","displayDocTitle":"Sufficient LMI conditions for output feedback control problems","volume":"44","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6255036","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sufficient LMI conditions for output feedback control problems","sourcePdf":"00763227.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031535S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"372","articleId":"763227","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":763232,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Within each category, a comparison of several currently available CAD tools is presented, and a tool which has been adapted for use or developed at the University of Rochester is discussed in greater detail. In addition, tools for timing analysis as well as integrated design environments that permit the effective data interchange among various tools and support libraries of design models are discussed. Future tools for timing optimization, automated logic synthesis, and automated layout synthesis are shown to be necessary for the design of superconducting circuits at the very large scale of integration (VLSI) level of integration.

On October 30, 1996, POLDER entered its nominal acquisition phase and worked perfectly until ADEOS's early end of service on June 30, 1997. POLDER is a multispectral imaging radiometer/polarimeter designed to collect global and repetitive observations of the solar radiation reflected by the Earth/atmosphere system, with a wide field of view (2400 km) and a moderate geometric resolution (6 km). The instrument concept is based on telecentric optics, on a rotating wheel carrying 15 spectral filters and polarizers, and on a bidimensional charge coupled device (CCD) detector array. In addition to the classical measurement and mapping characteristics of a narrow-band imaging radiometer, POLDER has a unique ability to measure polarized reflectances using three polarizers (for three of its eight spectral bands, 443 to 910 nm) and to observe target reflectances from 13 different viewing directions during a single satellite pass. One of POLDER's original features is that its in-flight radiometric calibration does not rely on any on-board device. Many calibration methods using well-characterized calibration targets have been developed to achieve a very high calibration accuracy. This paper presents the various methods implemented in the in-flight calibration plan and the results obtained during the instrument calibration phase: absolute calibration over molecular scattering, interband calibration over sunglint and clouds, multiangular calibration over deserts and clouds, intercalibration with Ocean Color and Temperature Scanner (OCTS), and water vapor channels calibration over sunglint using meteorological analysis. A brief description of the algorithm and of the performances of each method is given.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/763266/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","volume":"37","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6267938","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Results of POLDER in-flight calibration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Results of POLDER in-flight calibration","sourcePdf":"00763266.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057665S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"104","articleId":"763266","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":763269,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The authors developed a technique, based on multiresolution wavelet decomposition, for the merging and data fusion of such images. The method presented consists of adding the wavelet coefficients of the high-resolution image to the multispectral (low-resolution) data. They have studied several possibilities concluding that the method which produces the best results consists in adding the high order coefficients of the wavelet transform of the panchromatic image to the intensity component (defined as L=(R+G+B)/3) of the multispectral image. The method is, thus, an improvement on standard intensity-hue-saturation (IHS or LHS) mergers. They used the \"a trous\" algorithm which allows the use of a dyadic wavelet to merge nondyadic data in a simple and efficient scheme. They used the method to merge SPOT and LANDSAT/sup TM/ images.

They can be applied to unmix low-resolution images using the information about their pixel composition from co-registered high-resolution images. This makes it possible to fuse the low- and high-resolution images for a synergetic interpretation. The constrained unmixing preserves all the available radiometric information of the low-resolution image. On the other hand, the unconstrained unmixing may be preferable in case of noisy data. An analysis of the MMT sensitivity to sensor errors showed that the strongest requirement is the accuracy of geometric co-registration of the data; the co-registration errors should not exceed 0.1-0.2 of the low-resolution pixel size. Applications of the constrained and unconstrained algorithms are illustrated on examples of unmixing and fusion of the multiresolution reflective and thermal bands of a real TM/LANDSAT image as well as of a simulated image of the future ASTER/EOS-AMI sensor.","doi":"10.1109/36.763276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.763276","endPage":"1226","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/16544/00763276.pdf","startPage":"1212","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unmixing-based multisensor multiresolution image fusion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/763276/","displayDocTitle":"Unmixing-based multisensor multiresolution image fusion","volume":"37","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"6262152","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unmixing-based multisensor multiresolution image fusion","sourcePdf":"00763276.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046013S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"215","articleId":"763276","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":763278,"authors":[{"name":"Byeungwoo Jeon","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Sung Kyun Kwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Byeungwoo Jeon","id":"37288654000"},{"name":"D.A.

Often, this problem is one of integrating appropriately multitemporal data sets that are completely different in nature, such as the updating of old vector data with new image data. In this paper, a methodology is proposed for the updating of land-cover databases of rural areas by using very high-resolution panchromatic space-borne imagery. The task is to identify the extension of urban and industrial areas. At a given scale, the homogeneity of texture derived from newly acquired imagery is measured within the polygons to update by means of a knowledge-based segmentation approach. In a successive step, the new region boundaries are compared with the existing polygons. This basically transforms the change-detection problem into one of image segmentation. Experimental results for the updating of land-cover maps by IRS-1C panchromatic imagery indicate the usefulness of the direction that is adopted.","doi":"10.1109/36.763282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.763282","endPage":"1254","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/16544/00763282.pdf","startPage":"1244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Updating land-cover maps by using texture information from very high-resolution space-borne imagery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/763282/","displayDocTitle":"Updating land-cover maps by using texture information from very high-resolution space-borne imagery","volume":"37","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"6262155","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Updating land-cover maps by using texture information from very high-resolution space-borne imagery","sourcePdf":"00763282.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05998S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"50","articleId":"763282","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":763284,"authors":[{"name":"B.C.K.

With the increasing availability of multisource remotely sensed data sets, random field models, especially Markov random fields (MRF), have been found to provide a theoretically robust yet mathematical tractable way of coding multisource information and of modeling contextual behavior. It is well known that the performance of a model is dependent both on its functional form (in this case, the classification algorithm) and on the accuracy of the estimates of model parameters. In dealing with multisource data, the determination of source weighting and MRF model parameters is a difficult issue. The authors extend the methodology proposed by A. H. Schistad et al.

After a directional prefiltering step, a morphological line detector is presented. To improve the detection performances, the results obtained on multitemporal data are fused. Different fusion strategies involving different fusion operators are then presented. Since extensions of classical set union and intersection do not lead to satisfactory results (the corresponding operators are either too indulgent or too severe), the first strategy consists of fusing the data using a compromise operator. The second strategy consists of fusing the results computed with two operators that have opposite properties, in order to obtain a final intermediate result. Thanks to the wide range of properties they provide, fuzzy operators are used to test and compare these two fusion strategies on real ERS-1 multitemporal data.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy fusion techniques for linear features detection in multitemporal SAR images","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/36.763290","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/16544/00763290.pdf","startPage":"1292","endPage":"1305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.763290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16544","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=763290","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/763290/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy fusion techniques for linear features detection in multitemporal SAR images","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6262159","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy fusion techniques for linear features detection in multitemporal SAR images","sourcePdf":"00763290.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062334S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"119","articleId":"763290","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":763292,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The inherent characteristics of hyperspectral feature space still require the development of information extraction algorithms with a high degree of accuracy. Data fusion techniques can enable one to analyze high-dimensional data that is provided by hyperspectral sensors. There are two levels of fusion that will be discussed in the present paper: feature fusion and decision fusion. Feature fusion is a projection from one feature vector space (spectral bands) to another. An example of this is multispectral data feature extraction. In decision fusion, a local discrimination is performed at each sensor. Then the set of decisions is combined in a decision fusion center. This center has a set of algorithms to integrate the individual and local decisions of each sensor. The algorithms are based on different techniques such as majority voting, max rule, min rule, average rule and neural network. Experiments show that feature and decision fusion schemes enhance the classification accuracy of hyperspectral data.","doi":"10.1109/36.763300","startPage":"1360","endPage":"1366","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/16544/00763300.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.763300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of hyperdimensional data based on feature and decision fusion approaches using projection pursuit, majority voting, and neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral sensors","Hyperspectral imaging","Data analysis","Pattern recognition","Voting","Neural networks","Data mining","Remote sensing","Robotics and automation","Vehicle detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","geophysical signal processing","geophysics computing","remote sensing","terrain mapping","image classification","neural nets","multidimensional signal processing","sensor fusion","feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical measurement technique","land surface","terrain mapping","remote sensing","image classification","multidimensional signal processing","multispectral remote sensing","hyperdimensional data","decision fusion approach","projection pursuit","majority voting","neural network","neural net","hyperspectral remote sensing","hyperspectral feature space","information extraction algorithm","data fusion","sensor fusion","feature fusion","decision fusion","feature vector space","spectral band","feature extraction","local discrimination"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/763300/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","displayDocTitle":"Classification of hyperdimensional data based on feature and decision fusion approaches using projection pursuit, majority voting, and neural networks","volume":"37","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6262165","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of hyperdimensional data based on feature and decision fusion approaches using projection pursuit, majority voting, and neural networks","sourcePdf":"00763300.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050387S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"67","articleId":"763300","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":763301,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

The comparison of model predictions with independent experimental data shows good correlations, especially in terms of spectral characteristics.

These secondary sources are interconnected through an electronic system using a specific signal processing algorithm for the particular cancellation scheme. ANC has application to a wide variety of problems in manufacturing, industrial operations, and consumer products. The emphasis of this paper is on the practical aspects of ANC systems in terms of adaptive signal processing and digital signal processing (DSP) implementation for real-world applications. In this paper, the basic adaptive algorithm for ANC is developed and analyzed based on single-channel broad-band feedforward control. This algorithm is then modified for narrow-band feedforward and adaptive feedback control. In turn, these single-channel ANC algorithms are expanded to multiple-channel cases. Various online secondary-path modeling techniques and special adaptive algorithms, such as lattice, frequency-domain, subband, and recursive-least-squares, are also introduced. Applications of these techniques to actual problems are highlighted by several examples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/763310/","volume":"87","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"6268835","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Active noise control: a tutorial review","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active noise control: a tutorial review","sourcePdf":"00763310.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086687S","chronDate":"June  1999","isNumber":"16546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"724","articleId":"763310","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":763314,"authors":[{"name":"H.J.

At the heart of the technique is a microfabricated cantilever with a sharp tip on the end. Using modern micromachining techniques, it is possible to batch fabricate cantilevers with tips that are sharp on the scale of 100 /spl Aring/. We have pursued a particular AFM storage scheme based on mechanical readback of topographic data using high-frequency piezoresistive silicon cantilevers. Areal densities of 65 Gbit/in/sup 2/ have been demonstrated, with readback rates greater than 10 Mbit/s. Nanoreplication techniques have been used to produce read-only disks. In addition, a write-once scheme was developed that uses integrated heating elements on the cantilevers in order to perform thermomechanical writing on a polymer substrate. Considerable progress has been made in addressing critical issues such as data rate, reliability, and practical implementation, but significant challenges still remain, both in the technology and in finding the most suitable applications.","doi":"10.1109/5.763314","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/16546/00763314.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.763314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16546","startPage":"1014","endPage":"1027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-density data storage based on the atomic force microscope","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=763314","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-density data storage based on the atomic force microscope","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/763314/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"87","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1999","accessionNumber":"6268837","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-density data storage based on the atomic force microscope","sourcePdf":"00763314.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075952S","chronDate":"June  1999","isNumber":"16546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"64","articleId":"763314","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":763322,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The uniform carrier distribution observed in the MPS/SPEED/SSD rectifiers leads to a universal trade-off curve in anode injection efficiency control diodes that is inherently superior to that obtained through lifetime control techniques. The SPEED rectifier is most attractive for high voltage applications due to its low reverse leakage current, while the MPS rectifier provides an excellent alternative to the high voltage PiN diode due to the identical fabrication process and its superior switching characteristics.","pdfPath":"/iel5/6175/16497/00764085.pdf","startPage":"153","endPage":"156","publicationTitle":"11th International Symposium on Power Semiconductor Devices and ICs.

This is inconsequential in classical digital links where phase-coherent data flows continuously. However, if data arrives in asynchronous packets, as it does in modern communication systems such as PON\u2019s (Passive Optical Networks), long locking times cause significant penalties in the transmission efficiency. For burst-mode applications new clock recovery methods with greater acquisition agility are needed.

Some problems have been associated with many previous diagnostic models. A careful review indicates that the most serious problems were: * inability to handle: - multiple diseases coexistent in the patient - partially described diseases - extraneous input symptoms - quantitative signs along with symptoms * inflexible and non-extendible prototype models * lack of inclusive physician-approved data banks The use of computer techniques developed for large scale wargaming has allowed the construction of an extendable prototype model. The hierarchical searching techniques used provided the necessary partial matching solution to the above set of computational problems.

Edgebreaker improves upon the storage required by previously reported schemes, most of which can guarantee only an O(t log(t)) storage cost for the incidence graph of a mesh of t triangles. Edgebreaker requires at most 2t bits for any mesh homeomorphic to a sphere and supports fully general meshes by using additional storage per handle and hole. For large meshes, entropy coding yields less than 1.5 bits per triangle. Edgebreaker's compression and decompression processes perform identical traversals of the mesh from one triangle to an adjacent one. At each stage, compression produces an op-code describing the topological relation between the current triangle and the boundary of the remaining part of the mesh. Decompression uses these op-codes to reconstruct the entire incidence graph. Because Edgebreaker's compression and decompression are independent of the vertex locations, they may be combined with a variety of vertex-compressing techniques that exploit topological information about the mesh to better estimate vertex locations. Edgebreaker may be used to compress the connectivity of an entire mesh bounding a 3D polyhedron or the connectivity of a triangulated surface patch whose boundary need not be encoded. The paper also offers a comparative survey of the rapidly growing field of geometric compression.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/764870/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan-Mar 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan-Mar 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan.-March 1999","accessionNumber":"6253160","volume":"5","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Edgebreaker: connectivity compression for triangle meshes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Edgebreaker: connectivity compression for triangle meshes","sourcePdf":"00764870.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036878S","chronDate":"Jan-Mar 1999","isNumber":"16550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"359","articleId":"764870","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":764871,"authors":[{"name":"G.K.I.

However, fuzzy PID controller design is still a complex task due to the involvement of a large number of parameters in defining the fuzzy rule base. This paper investigates different fuzzy PID controller structures, including the Mamdani-type controller. By expressing the fuzzy rules in different forms, each PLD structure is distinctly identified. For purpose of analysis, a linear-like fuzzy controller is defined. A simple analytical procedure is developed to deduce the closed form solution for a three-input fuzzy inference. This solution is used to identify the fuzzy PID action of each structure type in the dissociated form. The solution for single-input-single-output nonlinear fuzzy inferences illustrates the effect of nonlinearity tuning. The design of a fuzzy PID controller is then treated as a two-level tuning problem. The first level tunes the nonlinear PID gains and the second level tunes the linear gains, including scale factors of fuzzy variables. By assigning a minimum number of rules to each type, the linear and nonlinear gains are deduced and explicitly presented. The tuning characteristics of different fuzzy PID structures are evaluated with respect to their functional behaviors. The rule decoupled and one-input rule structures proposed in this paper provide greater flexibility and better functional properties than the conventional fuzzy PHD structures.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/764871/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1999","accessionNumber":"6260981","pubMedId":"18252311","volume":"29","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of direct action fuzzy PID controller structures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of direct action fuzzy PID controller structures","sourcePdf":"00764871.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038884S","chronDate":"June  1999","isNumber":"16558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"204","articleId":"764871","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-02"},{"_id":764872,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The approach is based on the use of a pattern recognition scheme, the quadratic classifier, to find collision-free paths in unknown indoor corridor environments. Obstacles treated in this study include the walls of the corridor and the objects that appear in the way of ALV navigation in the corridor. Detected obstacles as well as the two sides of the ALV body are considered as patterns. A systematic method for separating these patterns into two classes is proposed. The two pattern classes are used as the input data to design a quadratic classifier. Finally, the two-dimensional decision boundary of the classifier, which goes through the middle point between the two front vehicle wheels, is taken as a local collision-free path. This approach is implemented on a real ALV and successful navigations confirm the feasibility of the approach.","doi":"10.1109/3477.764877","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00764877.png","startPage":"416","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/16558/00764877.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.764877","endPage":"426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16558","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Obstacle avoidance for autonomous land vehicle navigation in indoor environments by quadratic classifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/764877/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1999","displayDocTitle":"Obstacle avoidance for autonomous land vehicle navigation in indoor environments by quadratic classifier","volume":"29","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6260985","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1999","pubMedId":"18252315","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Obstacle avoidance for autonomous land vehicle navigation in indoor environments by quadratic classifier","sourcePdf":"00764877.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030749S","chronDate":"June  1999","isNumber":"16558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"5","articleId":"764877","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":764878,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

GA's used earlier in clustering employ either an expensive crossover operator to generate valid child chromosomes from parent chromosomes or a costly fitness function or both. To circumvent these expensive operations, we hybridize GA with a classical gradient descent algorithm used in clustering, viz. K-means algorithm. Hence, the name genetic K-means algorithm (GKA). We define K-means operator, one-step of K-means algorithm, and use it in GKA as a search operator instead of crossover. We also define a biased mutation operator specific to clustering called distance-based-mutation. Using finite Markov chain theory, we prove that the GKA converges to the global optimum. It is observed in the simulations that GKA converges to the best known optimum corresponding to the given data in concurrence with the convergence result. It is also observed that GKA searches faster than some of the other evolutionary algorithms used for clustering.","doi":"10.1109/3477.764879","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/16558/00764879.pdf","startPage":"433","endPage":"439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.764879","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00764879.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic K-means algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=764879","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1999","displayDocTitle":"Genetic K-means algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/764879/","publicationDate":"June 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6260987","pubMedId":"18252317","volume":"29","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic K-means algorithm","sourcePdf":"00764879.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066294S","chronDate":"June  1999","isNumber":"16558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"687","articleId":"764879","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":764880,"authors":[{"name":"R.

While neural networks can achieve high predictive accuracy rates, the decision boundaries they form are highly nonlinear and generally difficult to comprehend. Decision trees, on the other hand, can be readily translated into a set of rules. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for generating oblique decision trees that capitalizes on the strength of both approaches. Oblique decision trees classify the patterns by testing on linear combinations of the input attributes. As a result, an oblique decision tree is usually much smaller than the univariate tree generated for the same domain. Our algorithm consists of two components: connectionist and symbolic. A three-layer feedforward neural network is constructed and pruned, a decision tree is then built from the hidden unit activation values of the pruned network. An oblique decision tree is obtained by expressing the activation values using the original input attributes. We test our algorithm on a wide range of problems. The oblique decision trees generated by the algorithm preserve the high accuracy of the neural networks, while keeping the explicitness of decision trees. Moreover, they outperform univariate decision trees generated by the symbolic approach and oblique decision trees built by other approaches in accuracy and tree size.","doi":"10.1109/3477.764880","startPage":"440","endPage":"444","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.764880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16558","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/16558/00764880.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A connectionist approach to generating oblique decision trees","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/764880/","displayDocTitle":"A connectionist approach to generating oblique decision trees","volume":"29","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6260988","pubMedId":"18252318","publicationDate":"June 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A connectionist approach to generating oblique decision trees","sourcePdf":"00764880.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140601S","chronDate":"June  1999","isNumber":"16558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"24","articleId":"764880","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":764881,"authors":[{"name":"Shie-Jue Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shie-Jue Lee","id":"37087143929"},{"name":"Mu-Tune Jone","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Mu-Tune Jone","id":"37087968808"},{"name":"Hsien-Leing Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hsien-Leing Tsai","id":"37087218083"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"764881","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Information entropy","Simulated annealing","Multi-layer neural network","Training data","Artificial neural networks","Backpropagation algorithms","Councils","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","entropy codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","multiclass-discretization","information entropy","entropy-based method","low recognition rate","entropy measure"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=764881","abstract":"Cios and Liu (1992) proposed an entropy-based method to generate the architecture of neural networks for supervised two-class discretization.

This two-class-based method ends up with the disability of sharing hidden nodes among different classes and a low recognition rate.

As in the case of the standard union bound for turbo codes, we expect these bounds to be useful for rather large values of signal-to-noise ratios, i.e., signal-to-noise ratios for which the code rate is smaller than the corresponding cutoff rate. The bound is based on \"uniform interleaving\" just as its counterpart for standard turbo coding. The derived bound provides a tool for comparing coded modulation schemes having different component codes, interleaver lengths, mappings, etc., using maximum-likelihood decoding.

With such sequences, special coded modulation schemes can then be designed to access the diversity provided by the multiple transmitters without having to use an interleaver or expand the signal bandwidth. The code matrix notion is introduced for the coded modulation scheme, and its design criteria are also established.

The analysis is for time-division multiple access (TDMA) with frequency hopping, power control, and discontinuous transmission, and the radio channel is composed of an inverse fourth-power path loss law with log-normal fading. We commence by introducing a single microcell into a hexagonal cluster of macrocells before considering clustered microcells. Both omnidirectional and sectorized cells are examined. We find that high reuse factors are required when channel sharing is employed. When channel partitioning is used, no co-channel interference occurs between the microcells and the macrocells allowing them to be planned independently. The reuse factors in the microcells and macrocells therefore do not need to be increased beyond conventional values. The outcome is that by opting for channel partitioning, the improvement in spectral efficiency compared to channel sharing is two to three times greater.","doi":"10.1109/26.764930","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/16551/00764930.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.764930","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16551","startPage":"568","endPage":"576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Introducing microcells into macrocellular networks: a case study","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=764930","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Introducing microcells into macrocellular networks: a case study","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/764930/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6262088","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Introducing microcells into macrocellular networks: a case study","sourcePdf":"00764930.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068499S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"30","articleId":"764930","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":764931,"authors":[{"name":"V.K.N.

The channel is modeled as providing only a single fading path for each user and with no additional means to achieve diversity. The design of the detector is based on using fractionally sampled matched filter outputs to simultaneously achieve two goals: 1) the novel realization of a one shot decorrelator with lower computational complexity and 2) the forming of the maximum-likelihood decision rule on the decorrelated outputs, which results in an effective increase of the correlation in the fading process.

In this paper, the error probability of a multicell CDMA system, operating with imperfect power control over a frequency selective multipath fading channel, is derived. Asymptotic expressions (for high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios) of the error probability show that the use of diversity combining exacerbates the effect of the power control error (PCE), since the power control is identical on each diversity channel; also, the error probability increases exponentially with PCE, while (asymptotically) increasing linearly with the number of users and decreasing inverse linearly with the processing gain. In addition to the asymptotic results mentioned above, both Chernoff bounds on, and approximations to, the error probability are found. Numerical results reveal the tightness of the Chernoff bounds, and show that the approximations are actually much tighter than the bounds, at least for PCE standard deviations of 1.5 dB or less.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error probability of multicell CDMA over frequency selective fading channels with power control error","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.764934","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/16551/00764934.pdf","startPage":"608","endPage":"617","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.764934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16551","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=764934","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/764934/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","displayDocTitle":"Error probability of multicell CDMA over frequency selective fading channels with power control error","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6262092","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error probability of multicell CDMA over frequency selective fading channels with power control error","sourcePdf":"00764934.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033808S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"33","articleId":"764934","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":764936,"authors":[{"name":"W.S.

A servomechanism (MIME) moved the forearm in simple planar trajectories, directly controlling hand position and forearm orientation. Design specifications are presented, along with system performance data during an initial test of 13 stroke subjects with a wide range of impairment levels. Performance of subjects was quantified by measuring the forces and torques between the paretic limb and the servomechanism as the subjects relaxed (passive), or attempted to generate force in the direction of movement (active). During passive movements, the more severely impaired subjects resisted movement, producing higher levels of negative work than less-impaired subjects and neurologically normal controls. During active movements, the more severely impaired subjects produced forces with larger directional errors, and were less efficient in producing work. These metrics had significant test-retest repeatability. These motor performance metrics can potentially detect smaller within-subject changes than motor function scales. This method could complement currently used measurement tools for the evaluation of subjects during recovery from stroke, or during therapeutic interventions.","doi":"10.1109/10.764942","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/16556/00764942.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.764942","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16556","startPage":"652","endPage":"662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantification of force abnormalities during passive and active-assisted upper-limb reaching movements in post-stroke hemiparesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=764942","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Quantification of force abnormalities during passive and active-assisted upper-limb reaching movements in post-stroke hemiparesis","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/764942/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1999","accessionNumber":"6272346","pubMedId":"10356872","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantification of force abnormalities during passive and active-assisted upper-limb reaching movements in post-stroke hemiparesis","sourcePdf":"00764942.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074011S","chronDate":"June  1999","isNumber":"16556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"95","articleId":"764942","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":764948,"authors":[{"name":"E.A.

This paper develops optimal time-varying selection of the smoothing window length using a stochastic model of the EMG signal. Optimal selection is a function of the EMG amplitude and its derivatives. Simulation studies, in which EMG amplitude was changed randomly, found that the \"best\" adaptive filter performed as well as the \"best\" fixed-length filter. Experimental studies found the advantages of the adaptive processor to be situation dependent. Subjects used real-time EMG amplitude estimates to track a randomly-moving target. Perhaps due to task difficulty, no differences in adaptive versus fixed-length processors were observed when the target speed was fast. When the target speed was slow, the experimental results mere consistent with the simulation predictions. When the target moved between two constant levels, the adaptive processor responded rapidly to the target level transitions and had low variance while the target dwelled on a level.","doi":"10.1109/10.764948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.764948","startPage":"717","endPage":"729","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/16556/00764948.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electromyogram amplitude estimation with adaptive smoothing window length","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1999","displayDocTitle":"Electromyogram amplitude estimation with adaptive smoothing window length","publicationDate":"June 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"46","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6272352","pubMedId":"10356878","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/764948/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electromyogram amplitude estimation with adaptive smoothing window length","sourcePdf":"00764948.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034383S","chronDate":"June  1999","isNumber":"16556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"38","articleId":"764948","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":764949,"authors":[{"name":"E.A.

This assumption leads to root-mean-square (RMS) processing as the maximum likelihood estimator of the EMG amplitude (where EMG amplitude is defined as the standard deviation of the random process). Contrary to this theoretical formulation, experimental work has found the signal-to-noise-ratio [(SNR), defined as the mean of the amplitude estimate divided by its standard deviation] using mean-absolute-value (MAV) processing to be superior to RMS. This paper reviews RMS processing with the Gaussian model and then derives the expected (inferior) SNR performance of MAV processing with the Gaussian model. Next, a new model for the surface EMG signal, using a Laplacian density, is presented. It is shown that the MAV processor is the maximum likelihood estimator of the EMG amplitude for the Laplacian model. SNR performance based on a Laplacian model is predicted to be inferior to that of the Gaussian model by approximately 32%. Thus, minor variations in the probability distribution of the EMG may result in large decrements in SNR performance. Lastly, experimental data from constant-force, constant-angle, nonfatiguing contractions were examined. The experimentally observed densities fell in between the theoretic Gaussian and Laplacian densities. On average, the Gaussian density best fit the experimental data, although results varied with subject. For amplitude estimation, MAV processing had a slightly higher SNR than RMS processing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/764949/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1999","accessionNumber":"6272353","pubMedId":"10356879","volume":"46","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Probability density of the surface electromyogram and its relation to amplitude detectors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probability density of the surface electromyogram and its relation to amplitude detectors","sourcePdf":"00764949.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026865S","chronDate":"June  1999","isNumber":"16556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"108","articleId":"764949","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":764950,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The results indicate that DS-CDMA with a DFE receiver can be used to integrate dual-rate services without adversely affecting the system capacity. The overall system capacity is shown to be approximately equal to half the spreading gain and is unaffected when interferers at different data rates are present. The proposed scheme needs only average power control and is not found to be sensitive to power control errors of /spl plusmn/2 dB.","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00764958.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/16555/00764958.pdf","startPage":"683","endPage":"695","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.764958","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.764958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16555","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=764958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of a dual-rate DS-CDMA-DFE in an overlaid cellular system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Decision feedback equalizers","Bandwidth","Delay","Power control","Microcell networks","Personal communication networks","Interference","Radio frequency","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spread spectrum communication","code division multiple access","multiuser channels","decision feedback equalisers","radio receivers","telecommunication control","power control","channel capacity","interference suppression","microcellular radio","personal communication networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-rate DS-CDMA-DFE","overlaid cellular system","direct-sequence code-division multiple-access","DS-CDMA system","performance","decision feedback equalizer","DFE receiver","interfering signals","desired signal","dual-rate services","system capacity","spreading gain","data rates","average power control","power control errors","microcells","macrocells","personal communication services","PCS"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/764958/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","displayDocTitle":"Performance of a dual-rate DS-CDMA-DFE in an overlaid cellular system","volume":"48","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6267865","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of a dual-rate DS-CDMA-DFE in an overlaid cellular system","sourcePdf":"00764958.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037722S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","articleId":"764958","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":764990,"authors":[{"name":"Wern-Ho Sheen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Chen University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wern-Ho Sheen","id":"37087172633"},{"name":"Jiun-Kai Tzeng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Chen University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jiun-Kai Tzeng","id":"37088128869"},{"name":"Ching-Kae Tzou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Chen University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Kae Tzou","id":"37087951821"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"764990","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=764990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of cell correlations in a matched-filter PN code acquisition for direct-sequence spread-spectrum systems","abstract":"Rapid pseudonoise (PN) code acquisition with matched-filter correlators has been very popular in direct-sequence (DS) spread-spectrum systems. Conventionally, the analysis of this acquisition method is based on the assumption that the detections among cells are independent. However, there may be strong correlations among cell detections for the case that the cell size is less than a chip duration. In this paper, the mean acquisition time performance of the acquisition method is analyzed with the cell correlations being taken into account. Numerical results show that depending on the threshold value and other system parameters, the effect of cell correlations may be over 20% of the mean acquisition time for signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of practical interest. The analytical results are substantiated by computer simulations.","doi":"10.1109/25.764990","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"724","endPage":"732","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.764990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16555","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/16555/00764990.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlators","Spread spectrum communication","Performance analysis","Timing","Tracking loops","Signal to noise ratio","Computer simulation","Matched filters","Computer errors","Face detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spread spectrum communication","cellular radio","correlators","pseudonoise codes","synchronisation","matched filters","filtering theory","noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cell correlations","matched-filter PN code acquisition","direct-sequence spread-spectrum systems","pseudonoise code acquisition","matched-filter correlators","DS-SS","cell detection","cell size","chip duration","mean acquisition time performance","threshold value","system parameters","signal-to-noise ratios","SNR","computer simulations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Effects of cell correlations in a matched-filter PN code acquisition for direct-sequence spread-spectrum systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/764990/","volume":"48","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"6267868","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of cell correlations in a matched-filter PN code acquisition for direct-sequence spread-spectrum systems","sourcePdf":"00764990.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050064S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"14","articleId":"764990","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":764992,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

The UMTS code-division testbed (CODIT R2020) is a research project within the European RACE-II program set up by the Commission of the European Community. Our goal is to be able to simulate in the laboratory, in real time, the multipath propagation found in the mobile radio channel. As code-division multiple access (CDMA) is the access technique within the CODIT project, it was realized that the channel emulator must have simultaneously good delay resolution between propagation paths and long duration of the impulse response. These considerations led to a very flexible channel emulator specifically designed to host the new wide-band channel models developed within the CODIT project. Our emulator features three independent inputs and two outputs, up to 20 complex propagation paths, 10-MHz radio frequency (RF) bandwidth, a delay resolution of 50 ns, and a maximum duration of the channel impulse response of 80 \u03bcs. Starting with an explanation of the global structure of the new channel emulator, we derive the optimum design of the interpolation procedures and present the main implementation issues arising from our initial architecture. Finally, we report the results of the laboratory tests of the first prototype of the channel emulator.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/16555/00764992.pdf","startPage":"746","endPage":"764","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.764992","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.764992","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16555","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=764992","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and implementation of a wide-band real-time mobile channel emulator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","Testing","Laboratories","Multiaccess communication","Propagation delay","Radio frequency","3G mobile communication","Land mobile radio","Bandwidth","Interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","digital simulation","fading channels","interpolation","land mobile radio","multipath channels","multiuser channels","real-time systems","research initiatives","telecommunication computing","transient response","UHF radio propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wide-band real-time mobile channel emulator","CODIT project","UMTS code-division testbed","CODIT R2020","research project","European RACE-II program","European Community","multipath propagation","mobile radio channel","laboratory","real time simulation","code-division multiple access","CDMA","access technique","delay resolution","impulse response duration","wide-band channel models","propagation paths","radio frequency bandwidth","RF bandwidth","global structure","interpolation procedures","laboratory tests","fading","UHF","2 MHz","10 MHz","80 mus"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/764992/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","displayDocTitle":"Design and implementation of a wide-band real-time mobile channel emulator","volume":"48","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6267870","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and implementation of a wide-band real-time mobile channel emulator","sourcePdf":"00764992.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044617S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"28","articleId":"764992","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":764993,"authors":[{"name":"Shouxing Qu","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Shouxing Qu","id":"38182370200"},{"name":"Tet Yeap","affiliation":["Bell Canada Advanced Research Laboratory and the School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Tet Yeap","id":"37274191900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"764993","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":317},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=764993","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Autocorrelation","Phase shift keying","Two dimensional displays","Signal analysis","Doppler shift","Land mobile radio","Electromagnetic scattering","Receivers","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["land mobile radio","electromagnetic wave scattering","fading channels","probability","spectral analysis","radiowave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D scattering model","fading channels","land mobile environment","horizontal traveling plane waves","nonzero elevation angle","arriving wave","urban environment","elevation angle distribution","field measurement","power spectral density","PSD","received signal","functions","asymmetrical PDF","symmetrical PDF","Clarke's scattering model"]}],"abstract":"Clarke's (1968) scattering model, one of the most widely accepted channel models for the land mobile environment, is a two-dimensional (2-D) model because of the assumption of horizontal traveling plane waves. By introducing a nonzero elevation angle of the arriving wave, a three-dimensional (3-D) model is more general and accurate, especially for the urban environment. Though the concept of the 3-D model has been proposed already, there is still a lack of satisfying results regarding the distribution of the elevation angle, from both theoretical analysis and field measurement, and the power spectral density (PSD) of the received signal. In this paper, a family of functions with two parameters, {m,n}, where m and n are positive integers, for both the symmetrical and asymmetrical probability density function (PDF) of the elevation angle (EA), is proposed. Among these functions, those with odd m and n lead to analytical solutions of the PSD of the received signal in addition to satisfying other requirements for a PDF of the EA previously proposed in literature. The PSDs in closed form associated with m and n equal to one and three are derived in particular, and the autocorrelation functions are obtained numerically. Since a family of functions rather than a single function is proposed for the PDF of the EA, it provides certain flexibility in application and covers a wide range of environments. Another contribution of this paper is a new expression which directly relates the PDF of the EA in the 3-D model to the PSD of the received signal.","doi":"10.1109/25.764993","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.764993","endPage":"781","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/16555/00764993.pdf","startPage":"765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A three-dimensional scattering model for fading channels in land mobile environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/764993/","displayDocTitle":"A three-dimensional scattering model for fading channels in land mobile environment","volume":"48","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"6267871","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A three-dimensional scattering model for fading channels in land mobile environment","sourcePdf":"00764993.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028489S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"43","articleId":"764993","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":764995,"authors":[{"name":"M.D. Yacoub","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of Campinas-UNICAMP, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"M.D.","lastName":"Yacoub","id":"37272286500"},{"name":"J.E.V.

The general procedure has the ability to react to variations of the traffic demand as more and more channels are being assigned to cell requirements. Allocations of channels to cells are made with a method that borrows insight from the theory of convex maximization.

The measurements were taken in two areas of Trenton, NJ, where building heights ranged from one to three stories.

For these high antennas, the average and standard deviations of the difference between the site-specific prediction and measurement are less than 1 and 5 dB, respectively.

New regulatory environments as well as competition in the communications industry require that these systems be deployed quickly and at low cost. Computer-based radio propagation prediction tools are strong candidates for this goal. We introduce an outdoor radio propagation prediction tool using a ray tracing technique in two dimensions (2-D) and three dimensions (3-D). We have compared the predicted and measured results in various propagation environments. Comparisons indicate that 2-D is adequate for a low transmitter while 3-D is recommended for a high transmitter whose height is comparable with or higher than surrounding buildings. In most locations, the computer tool predicts the correct propagation loss with a mean error of less than 7 dB and a standard deviation of less than 8 dB.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/16555/00765022.pdf","startPage":"931","endPage":"946","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.765022","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.765022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16555","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=765022","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radio propagation measurements and prediction using three-dimensional ray tracing in urban environments at 908 MHz and 1.9 GHz","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio propagation","Radio transmitters","Explosives","Wireless communication","Urban areas","Communication industry","Costs","Ray tracing","Two dimensional displays","Propagation losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UHF radio propagation","UHF measurement","ray tracing","telecommunication computing","radio transmitters","transmitting antennas","receiving antennas","UHF antennas","loss measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio propagation measurements","radio propagation prediction","three-dimensional ray tracing","urban environments","wireless communications services","regulatory environments","communications industry competition","computer-based propagation prediction tools","outdoor radio propagation prediction tool","2D ray tracing","3D ray tracing","low transmitter","high transmitter","transmitter height","buildings","propagation loss","mean error","standard deviation","UHF","transmitting antennas","receiving antennas","1.9 GHz","908 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/765022/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","displayDocTitle":"Radio propagation measurements and prediction using three-dimensional ray tracing in urban environments at 908 MHz and 1.9 GHz","volume":"48","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6267888","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio propagation measurements and prediction using three-dimensional ray tracing in urban environments at 908 MHz and 1.9 GHz","sourcePdf":"00765022.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043733S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"76","articleId":"765022","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":765026,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Efficient payload operations require operating the on-board power amplifiers (PAs) close to their saturated power whereby distortion effects cannot be neglected. This paper analyzes the impact of solid-state amplifiers on the Globalstar forward link multiplex when a single PA per beam is used and for the more practical case of an active phased-array satellite antenna. It is shown that the conventional noise power ratio (NPR) intermodulation figure fails to accurately predict the end-to-end system performance. Multibeam active-phased array is shown to provide superior performance compared to a system employing a single amplifier per antenna beam.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Payload nonlinearity impact on the Globalstar forward link multiplex.

We present two low-complexity efficient heuristics, the Heterogeneous Earliest-Finish-Time (HEFT) algorithm and the Critical-Path-on-a-Processor (CPOP) algorithm for scheduling directed acyclic weighted task graphs (DAGs) on a bounded number of heterogeneous processors.

The problem of mapping (defined as matching and scheduling) these tasks onto the machines of an HC environment has been shown, in general, to be NP-complete, requiring the development of heuristic techniques. Selecting the best heuristic to use in a given environment, however, remains a difficult problem, because comparisons are often clouded by different underlying assumptions in the original studies of each heuristic. Therefore, a collection of eleven heuristics from the literature has been selected, implemented, and analyzed under one set of common assumptions. The eleven heuristics examined are opportunistic load balancing, user-directed assignment, fast greedy, min-min, max-min, greedy, genetic algorithm, simulated annealing, genetic simulated annealing, tabu, and A*. This study provides one even basis for comparison and insights into circumstances where one technique will outperform another. The evaluation procedure is specified, the heuristics are defined, and then selected results are compared.","doi":"10.1109/HCW.1999.765093","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HCW.1999.765093","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Two types of mapping heuristics are considered: on-line and batch mode heuristics. Three new heuristics, one for batch and two for on-line, are introduced as part of this research. Simulation studies are performed to compare these heuristics with some existing ones. In total, five on-line heuristics and three batch heuristics are examined. The on-line heuristics consider; to varying degrees and in different ways, task affinity for different machines and machine ready times. The batch heuristics consider these factors, as well as aging of tasks waiting to execute. The simulation results reveal that the choice of mapping heuristic depends on parameters such as: (a) the structure of the heterogeneity among tasks and machines, (b) the optimization requirements, and (c) the arrival rate of the tasks.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HCW.1999.765094","doi":"10.1109/HCW.1999.765094","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Comparing the path loss with the measured one at 1.8 GHz demonstrates the effectiveness of the scattering model.

Measurements were conducted at a frequency of 762 MHz in different outdoor and indoor environments using vertical and horizontal polarization. The measurement system was built on commercial equipment only. The calibration process, which is an important stage of this kind of measurements, is described. To analyze the measurements the impulsive noise has been modeled as a pulse train where the pulse amplitude, pulse duration and elapsed time between pulses are considered random variables. It has been found that the pulse duration and elapsed time between pulses is not dependent on the antenna polarization while the pulse amplitude is, especially in the case of the noise generated by a fluorescent lamp. It has also been found that the pulse duration of the noise measured in the outdoor environments presents some clustering features and is correlated with the pulse amplitudes. This correlation may be caused by a RF noise bandwidth that is larger than the bandwidth of the measurement system. The noise in busy streets presents larger pulse durations, larger amplitude, and shorter elapsed time between pulses that the noise measured in a pedestrian area. Several statistical tests have been done to find the distribution function that best fits these random variables. Power Rayleigh, lognormal, exponential, Poisson, and Gamma distributions have been tested. According to the assessment carried out, none of the distribution functions is adequate to model the pulse amplitudes or the elapsed time between pulses, while the pulse duration seems to be Gamma distributed.","doi":"10.1109/15.765101","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/16554/00765101.pdf","startPage":"124","endPage":"136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/15.765101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impulsive noise measurements and characterization in a UHF digital TV channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=765101","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/765101/","displayDocTitle":"Impulsive noise measurements and characterization in a UHF digital TV channel","volume":"41","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6262030","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impulsive noise measurements and characterization in a UHF digital TV channel","sourcePdf":"00765101.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047885S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"91","articleId":"765101","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":765103,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The investigation has been performed with and without the human head model at an angle of 30/spl deg/ with respect to the vertical. To avoid the stair-step modeling of the cellular telephone for the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) formulation, the head has instead been tilted forward by 30/spl deg/ and a transformation of coordinates in the FDTD calculation has been used to obtain the desired vertical and horizontal polarizations. We show that the FDTD method gives results that are in good agreement with measurements, both for shape and gain of the radiation patterns, for all of the considered mobile telephones that use several types of antennas. Generally, a decrease of the cellular telephone gain for the vertical component of the field has been observed as compared to the vertical configuration of the telephone and also a decrease in gain is obtained when the phone is held against the human head. Furthermore, it is shown that the FDTD method is capable of providing fairly accurate results even for radiation patterns at a slanted angle and modeling of realistic cellular telephones.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/16554/00765103.pdf","startPage":"141","endPage":"144","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/15.765103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/15.765103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16554","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=765103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental and FDTD-computed radiation patterns of cellular telephones held in slanted operational conditions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Land mobile radio cellular systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","telephone sets","antenna radiation patterns","mobile antennas","finite difference time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDTD-computed radiation patterns","cellular telephones","experimental radiation patterns","head","performance","human head model","safety","finite-difference time-domain","coordinates transformation","horizontal polarization","vertical polarization","measurements","radiation pattern shape","radiation pattern gain","vertical field component","slanted angle"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/765103/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","displayDocTitle":"Experimental and FDTD-computed radiation patterns of cellular telephones held in slanted operational conditions","volume":"41","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6262032","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental and FDTD-computed radiation patterns of cellular telephones held in slanted operational conditions","sourcePdf":"00765103.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033689S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"5","articleId":"765103","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":765109,"authors":[{"name":"Kang Lan","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Kang Lan","id":"37272102300"},{"name":"Yaowu Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Yaowu Liu","id":"37279426500"},{"name":"Weigan Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Weigan Lin","id":"37291222800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9375"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-187X"}],"articleNumber":"765109","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":354},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electromagnetic Compatibility Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/emcs/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["FDTD methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","Maxwell equations","numerical stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dispersion reduction","FDTD algorithm","higher order scheme","finite-difference time-domain","second-order accuracy","fourth-order","Maxwell's equations","time domain solution","Yee FDTD algorithm","numerical dispersion","anisotropy","stability","dispersion analysis","frequency band","accurate solution","space increment","excitation","numerical results","wide-band electromagnetic phenomena","coarse grid","higher order difference formulas"]}],"abstract":"A finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) scheme with second-order accuracy in time and fourth-order in space is discussed for the solution of Maxwell's equations in the time domain.

In particular, we implemented intercommunication between components in our Management System for Heterogeneous Networks (MSHN) using four different CORBA mechanisms: the Static Invocation Interface (SII), the Dynamic Invocation Interface (DII), Untyped Event Services, and Typed Event Services. MSHN's goals are to manage dynamically changing sets of heterogeneous adaptive applications in a heterogeneous environment. We found these mechanisms at various stages of maturity, resulting in some being less useful than others. In addition, we found that the overhead added by CORBA varied from a low of 10.6 milliseconds per service request to a high of 279.1 milliseconds per service request on workstations connected via 100 Mbits/sec Ethernet. We therefore conclude that using CORBA not only substantially decreases the amount of time required to implement distributed system software, but it need not degrade performance.","doi":"10.1109/HCW.1999.765114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HCW.1999.765114","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The framework is based on a learning automata model. The proposed model can be used for dynamic task assignment and scheduling and can adapt itself to changes in the hardware or network environment. The important feature of the scheme is that it can work on multiple cost criteria, optimizing each criterion individually. The cost criterion could be a general metric like minimizing the total execution time, or an application specific metric defined by the user. The application task is modeled as a task flow graph (TFG), and the network of machines as a processor graph (PG). The automata model is constructed by associating every task in the TFG with a variable structure learning automaton. The actions of each automaton correspond to the nodes in the PG. The reinforcement scheme of the automaton considered is a linear scheme. Different heuristic techniques that guide the automata model to the optimal solution are presented. These heuristics are evaluated with respect to different cost metrics.","doi":"10.1109/HCW.1999.765118","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

This paper considers the problem of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for multiple uncorrelated plane waves incident on \"partially augmentable\" antenna arrays, whose difference set of interelement spacings is not complete. The DOA estimation problem for the case when the number of sources exceeds the number of contiguous covariance lags gives rise to the covariance matrix completion problem. Maximum-entropy (ME) positive-definite (p.d.) completion for partially specified Toeplitz covariance matrices is developed using convex programming techniques. By this approach, the classical Burg (1975) ME extension problem for the given set of covariance lags is generalized for the situation when some lags are missing. For DOA estimation purposes, we find the p.d. Toeplitz matrix with fixed eigensubspace dimension that is the closest approximation of the ME-completed matrix. Computer simulation results are presented to demonstrate the high DOA estimation accuracy of the proposed technique compared with the corresponding Cramer-Rao bound.","doi":"10.1109/78.765119","startPage":"1502","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/16552/00765119.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.765119","endPage":"1521","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16552","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Positive-definite Toeplitz completion in DOA estimation for nonuniform linear antenna arrays.

We develop a unified framework for resource scheduling in metacomputing systems where tasks with various requirements are submitted from participant sites. Our goal is to minimize the overall execution time of a collection of application tasks. In our model, each application task is represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). A task consists of several subtasks and the resource requirements are specified at subtask level. Our framework is general and it accommodates emerging notions of quality of service (QoS) and advance resource reservations. We present several scheduling algorithms which consider compute resources and data repositories that have advance reservations. As shown by our simulation results, it is advantageous to schedule the system resource separately. Our algorithms have at least 30% improvement over the separated approach with respect to completion time.","doi":"10.1109/HCW.1999.765123","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Most blind equalization methods, however, assume time-invariant channels and may not be applicable to fading channels with severe Doppler spread. We address the problem of simultaneously estimating the Doppler shift and channel parameters in a blind setup. Both deterministic and stochastic maximum likelihood methods are developed and iterative solutions proposed. The stochastic maximum likelihood solution is based on the modified version of the Baum-Welch (1970) algorithm, which originated in the study of hidden Markov models. The proposed methods are well suited for short data records appearing in TDMA systems. Identifiability and performance analysis issues are discussed, and Cramer-Rao bounds are derived.

This paper addresses the same question, but in the multiwavelet context, where the situation is different. This paper presents the construction of compactly supported orthogonal multiscaling functions that are continuously differentiable and cardinal. The scaling functions thereby support a Shannon-like sampling theorem.

MSHN's main goal is to determine the best way to support the execution of many different applications, each with its own quality of service (QoS) requirements, in a distributed, heterogeneous environment. MSHN's architecture consists of seven distributed, potentially replicated components that communicate with one another using CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture). MSHN's experimental investigations include: the accurate, transparent determination of the end-to-end status of resources; the identification of optimization criteria and how non-determinism and the granularity of models affect the performance of various scheduling heuristics that optimize those criteria; the determination of how security should be incorporated between components as well as how to account for security as a QoS attribute; and the identification of problems inherent in application and system characterization.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HCW.1999.765132","doi":"10.1109/HCW.1999.765132","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

It also formulates temporal and spectral psychoacoustic models of masking adapted to wavelet packet analysis. The algorithm of the proposed FFT-like overlapped block orthogonal wavelet packet transform permits us to efficiently approximate the auditory critical band decomposition in the time and frequency domains. This allows us to make use of the temporal and spectral masking properties of the human auditory system to decrease the average bit rate of the encoder while perceptually hiding the quantization error. The same wavelet packet representation is used to merge speech enhancement and coding in the context of auditory modeling. The advantage of the method presented in this paper over previous approaches is that perceptual enhancement and coding, which is usually implemented as a cascade of two separate systems, are combined. This leads to a decreased computational load. Experiments show that the proposed wideband coding procedure by itself can achieve transparent coding of speech signals sampled at 16 kHz at an average bit rate of 39.4 kbit/s. The combined speech coding-enhancement procedure achieves higher bit rate values that depend on the residual noise characteristics at the output of the enhancement process.","doi":"10.1109/78.765133","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/16552/00765133.pdf","startPage":"1622","endPage":"1635","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.765133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16552","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Perceptual speech coding and enhancement using frame-synchronized fast wavelet packet transform algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=765133","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/765133/","displayDocTitle":"Perceptual speech coding and enhancement using frame-synchronized fast wavelet packet transform algorithms","volume":"47","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1999","accessionNumber":"6268745","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Perceptual speech coding and enhancement using frame-synchronized fast wavelet packet transform algorithms","sourcePdf":"00765133.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087015S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"70","articleId":"765133","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":765134,"authors":[{"name":"A.P.

When the order of the channel is known, the algorithms are able to identify the channel, under the so-called length and zero conditions. Furthermore, in the noiseless case, the channel can be perfectly equalized. Less is known about the performance of these algorithms in the practically inevitable cases in which the channel possesses long tails of \"small\" impulse response terms. We study the performance of the mth-order least-squares and subspace methods using a perturbation analysis approach. We partition the true impulse response into the mth-order significant part and the tails. We show that the mth-order least-squares or subspace methods estimate an impulse response that is \"close\" to the mth-order significant part. The closeness depends on the diversity of the mth-order significant part and the size of the tails. Furthermore, we show that if we try to model not only the \"large\" terms but also some \"small\" ones, then the quality of our estimate may degrade dramatically; thus, we should avoid modeling \"small\" terms. Finally, we present simulations using measured microwave radio channels, highlighting potential advantages and shortcomings of the least-squares and subspace methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robustness of least-squares and subspace methods for blind channel identification/equalization with respect to effective channel undermodeling/overmodeling","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.765134","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/16552/00765134.pdf","startPage":"1636","endPage":"1645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.765134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16552","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=765134","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/765134/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","displayDocTitle":"Robustness of least-squares and subspace methods for blind channel identification/equalization with respect to effective channel undermodeling/overmodeling","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1999","accessionNumber":"6268746","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robustness of least-squares and subspace methods for blind channel identification/equalization with respect to effective channel undermodeling/overmodeling","sourcePdf":"00765134.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063088S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"47","articleId":"765134","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":765141,"authors":[{"name":"J.K.

A new procedure for estimation of weight increments for including in the LMS-type adaptive algorithms is proposed. This procedure applies a simple smoothing on the increment of the estimated weights to estimate the speed of weights. The estimated speeds are then used to predict the weights for the next iteration. The efficiency of the algorithm is confirmed by simulation results. The algorithm has a very low order of arithmetic complexity. Moreover, this procedure could be combined with a wide class of adaptive filters (e.g., RLS, gradient lattice algorithm, etc.) to improve their behaviors. The proposed algorithm is obtained by simplifying a Kalman filter. To this end, a Markov model of second order is considered for the weight vector. This model shows that the estimation of parameter increments inferred from the predicted parameters improves the tracking performance.","doi":"10.1109/78.765152","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"1735","endPage":"1739","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.765152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16552","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/16552/00765152.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive algorithm","Least squares approximation","Signal processing algorithms","Predictive models","Smoothing methods","Adaptive filters","Resonance light scattering","Time varying systems","Working environment noise","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tracking","parameter estimation","least mean squares methods","prediction theory","smoothing methods","adaptive filters","adaptive Kalman filters","Markov processes","time-varying filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["prediction","LMS-type adaptive algorithms","smoothly time varying environments","least mean square adaptive algorithms","normalized-LMS adaptive algorithms","tracking","weight increments estimation","speed of weights","iteration","efficiency","simulation","arithmetic complexity","adaptive filters","Kalman filter","Markov model","weight vector","parameter increments estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Prediction in LMS-type adaptive algorithms for smoothly time varying environments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/765152/","volume":"47","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"6268754","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction in LMS-type adaptive algorithms for smoothly time varying environments","sourcePdf":"00765152.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029212S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"41","articleId":"765152","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":765155,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The computation is straightforward, and the constraint for intersymbol interference is shown to be easy to include in the problem. A numerical example is given, and performance of the optimal signal shapes is compared with that resulting from the use of previously obtained signal shapes in the literature.

Recently, Inouye and Habe introduced a multistage criterion for attaining blind deconvolution of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. In this correspondence, based on their criterion, we present iterative algorithms for solving the blind deconvolution problem of MIMO LTI systems. However, their criterion should be subjected to several constraints of equations. Therefore, they proposed a new constraint-free multistage criterion for accomplishing the blind deconvolution of MIMO LTI systems.

This is done by solving a set of forward-backward linear prediction equations that relate the known (real) sensor outputs to the unknown (virtual) sensor outputs.

In such cases, IIR filters can be exploited but at the sacrifice of linearity of the phase response. However, FIR structures are preferred to the IIR ones due to well-known advantages of the former. We may also essentially require the FIR filter with its magnitude response having maximal flatness at an arbitrary frequency /spl omega//sub 0/ in the spectrum (0,/spl pi/). This article suggests mathematical formulas through which the frequency response H/spl tilde/(/spl omega/) may be approximated by design of a linear-phase, FIR configuration. The approximation may be made maximally flat (in the Butterworth sense) at an arbitrary frequency /spl omega//sub 0/,0</spl omega//sub 0/</spl pi/. A technique to compute the exact weights needed in the design has been given. No fractional delays are used in the proposed design. The application of such designs have also been indicated.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear approximation","Frequency response","Finite impulse response filter","Signal design","Delay","IIR filters","Signal processing","Jamming","Decorrelation","Digital signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FIR filters","linear phase filters","approximation theory","frequency response","signal processing","digital filters","linear network analysis","Butterworth filters","integrating circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FIR linear-phase approximations","frequency response","maximal flatness","signal processing","rational function","digital integrator","IIR filters","phase response","magnitude response","mathematical formulas","Butterworth approximation","exact weights"]}],"doi":"10.1109/78.765167","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/16552/00765167.pdf","startPage":"1772","endPage":"1775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.765167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FIR linear-phase approximations of frequency response 1/(j/spl omega/) for maximal flatness at an arbitrary frequency /spl omega//sub 0/,0</spl omega//sub 0/</spl pi/","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=765167","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FIR linear-phase approximations of frequency response 1/(j/spl omega/) for maximal flatness at an arbitrary frequency /spl omega//sub 0/,0</spl omega//sub 0/</spl pi/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/765167/","volume":"47","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6268763","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FIR linear-phase approximations of frequency response 1/(j/spl omega/) for maximal flatness at an arbitrary frequency /spl omega//sub 0/,0</spl omega//sub 0/</spl pi/","sourcePdf":"00765167.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05834S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"21","articleId":"765167","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":765170,"authors":[{"name":"K.

We also discuss whether microfabrication technology will allow a further increase in the number of electrode sites, or if an alternative way of interfacing, namely employing cell cultures on electrode substrates, will lead to higher efficiencies.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrodes","Muscles","Optical fiber devices","Force control","Microelectrodes","Optimal control","Rats","Probes","Neuromuscular","Extremities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neuromuscular stimulation","biomedical electrodes","microelectrodes","biocontrol","patient rehabilitation","LIGA","biomedical electronics","micromachining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neuro-electronic interfacing","multielectrode arrays","selectivity","2D array","rat peroneal nerve","extensor digitorum longum muscle","3D multiple needle array","LIGA technology","silicon and glass technology","efficiency","single motor fiber","microfabrication technology","cultured probe","motor-fiber stimulation","rehabilitative neuromuscular control","node density estimation","electrode spacing","motor-unit twitch","CMOS chip","containment of cells","dielectrophoretic forces"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Animals","Chromium Alloys","Electric Stimulation Therapy","Electrodes, Implanted","Equipment Design","Glass","Isometric Contraction","Microelectrodes","Motor Neurons","Muscle, Skeletal","Muscle, Skeletal","Nerve Fibers","Peroneal Nerve","Polymethyl Methacrylate","Rats","Rats, Wistar","Recruitment, Neurophysiological","Sensory Thresholds","Silicones","Stress, Mechanical","Transducers"]}],"doi":"10.1109/51.765188","publicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/51/16560/00765188.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16560","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/51.765188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neuro-electronic interfacing with multielectrode arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=765188","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Neuro-electronic interfacing with multielectrode arrays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/765188/","volume":"18","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May-June 1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6253590","pubMedId":"10337563","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May-June  1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neuro-electronic interfacing with multielectrode arrays","sourcePdf":"00765188.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052946S","chronDate":"May-June  1999","isNumber":"16560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"51","citationCount":"33","articleId":"765188","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":765194,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

[1975]. The cuffs were used to obtain higher signal amplitudes than previously possible, at least in chronic recordings, and to decrease the pick-up of noise, especially from muscles. Cuff electrodes are relatively stable in long-term recordings, but the stability has never been quantified in terms of input-output relationships; i.e., in terms of responses to repeatable stimuli over time. Moreover. The relationship between nerve damage and electrophysiological parameters has never been assessed. In this article, after reviewing the development of cuff electrodes and their applications, we present a long-term study of tactile peripheral nerve signals, electrically activated nerve signals, and impedance measurements. We show how the recordings vary over a 16-month period after implantation of nerve cuff electrodes in rabbits, and how nerve damage is reflected in the recorded signals.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/765194/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May-June  1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May-June 1999","accessionNumber":"6253595","pubMedId":"10337568","volume":"18","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cuff electrodes for long-term recording of natural sensory information","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cuff electrodes for long-term recording of natural sensory information","sourcePdf":"00765194.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095846S","chronDate":"May-June  1999","isNumber":"16560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"51","citationCount":"72","articleId":"765194","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":765203,"authors":[{"name":"R.R.

Proposals for solving this limitation using several transducers or speckle tracking can be found in the literature, but no method with a satisfactory performance has been found that can be used in a commercial implementation. A method for estimation of the velocity vector is presented. Here an oscillation transverse to the ultrasound beam is generated, so that a transverse motion yields a change in the received signals. The method uses two ultrasound beams for sampling the in-phase and quadrature component of the lateral field, and a set of samples (in-phase and quadrature in both time and space) are taken for each pulse-echo line. These four samples are then used in an autocorrelation approach that yields both the axial and the lateral velocity, and thus the velocity vector. The method has the advantage that a standard array transducer and a modified digital beamformer, like those used in modern ultrasound scanners, is sufficient to obtain the information needed. The signal processing preceding the beamforming can be implemented using standard signal processors, and it is robust since the autocorrelation method is used.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/765226/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"6429752","publicationDate":"1998","conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance of a vector velocity estimator [in ultrasound blood flow measurement]","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of a vector velocity estimator [in ultrasound blood flow measurement]","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"00765226.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040703S","chronDate":"1998","isNumber":"16511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6171","citationCount":"3","articleId":"765226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":765260,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The algorithm derived is nondecision-aided (NDA) and maximizes the low SNR limit of the likelihood function averaged over the MPSK signal constellation. It is also shown that for sufficient small SNR the ML phase estimator obtained reduces to the familiar Mth order power synchronizer which belongs to the class of NDA feedforward carrier synchronizers introduced earlier in the literature. Its mean-squared performance is obtained analytically and compared with simulation results. We observe that the resulting algorithm generates very accurate estimation even when the phase offset is high, that the self noise is absent and the performance of the NDA algorithm is basically the same as the Cramer-Rao bound for moderate to high SNR. Finally we note that the error variance derived for the mean-squared performance of this NDA ML synchronizer is an extension of the approximate variance formula of Moeneclaey and de Jonghe (1994) for M-PSK constellations.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Communications (Cat.

The key idea is to employ non-standard signal sets with small dimension matched to the OFDM framework; these signal sets are chosen to maximize the diversity of an uncoded system under a constraint to control the system PMEPR. These signal sets allow coded modulation schemes to achieve diversity equal to the product of the Hamming distance of the scheme and the frequency diversity of the channel, while still allowing optimal combined equalization/decoding of reasonable complexity in symbol-interleaved (as opposed to bit-interleaved) coded modulation schemes. Numerical results are presented both for systems employing uncoded modulation and for systems employing bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM). We conclude that the proposed BICM system can be viewed as a hybrid of a coded OFDM system and a coded single-carrier system employing a soft-output equalizer, thus providing the system designer a possible implementation for the correct combination of the two systems for a given application.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Communications (Cat.

Both maximal-ratio (MRC) and equal-gain (EGC) predetection diversity combining techniques have been considered. The exact closed-form formula for a MRC diversity system removes the limitations of previous studies in the literature which have been limited to Rayleigh fading. Moreover, an exact analysis of EGC for MQAM has not been reported previously despite its practical interest. The exact SER is expressed as a finite-range integral. Our unified expressions are sufficiently general to handle arbitrary fading parameters as well as dissimilar mean signal strengths across the diversity branches. The generality and computational efficiency of these new formulas render themselves as a powerful tool for SER analysis in different fading conditions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of maximal-ratio and equal-gain diversity systems for M-ary QAM on generalized fading channels","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Communications (Cat.

When the parameters of these detectors are chosen properly, they can provide an error performance that is close to ideal coherent detection. In this paper, we apply these two detection methods to a multiuser receiver for direct sequence CDMA. The multi-user receiver is implemented in the form of a multi-channel linear equalizer (LE), followed by either a bank of MSDD or a bank of PSAD. With this receiver structure, the front end equalizer is not required to perform any channel estimation. Fading gain estimation and compensation are done by the MSDD or the PSAD. It was found that both MSDD and PSAD perform substantially better than conventional differential detection when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is large (greater than 20 dB) and/or when the fade rate is high (greater than 1 percent the symbol rate).","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Communications (Cat.

(1998) to combat co-channel interference and increase the capacity for cellular CDMA. The structure uses a L-sensor (element) linear array. Each element is followed by a chip matched filter (CMF) and a fractionally spaced adaptive equalizer. The proposed structure outperforms the conventional receiver and the structures proposed in Abdulrahman et al. (1994) and Miller (1995) in-terms of capacity and near far resistance. In this paper we propose a new centralized decision feedback space-time receiver, which feeds back the detected symbols for all users through a FIR filter without respreading the detected symbols. The focus in this paper is the co-channel interference rejection capability of this structure. Analysis of the optimum tap weights and the minimum mean square error in multipath (no fading) channels are provided, and comparison between this structure and other structures are also provided.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Communications (Cat.

On wireline networks, bursty traffic is statistically multiplexed to fully utilize the link capacity. In light of recent proposals for wideband CDMA (WCDMA) to service multimedia data, there is a similar need to develop wireless network architectures with flexible bandwidth allocation to facilitate statistical multiplexing. To address this issue, we compared the throughput performance of two promising WCDMA configurations, high speed CDMA (HS-CDMA) and multi-code CDMA (MC-CDMA). HS-CDMA assigns each user a single code with small spreading gain to enable a high transmission rate when it is needed. In contrast, MC-CDMA employs codes with a large spreading gain but permits a user to acquire more than one code. As expected, the throughput of a configuration depends on the receiver structure as well as the operation scenarios like power and SNR constraints. When matched filter receivers are applied, HS-CDMA fares better in most occasions. When multi-user receivers are used, both configurations deliver the same throughput except the situation when the total power is bounded.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Communications (Cat.

Resource requirements are considered separately for the uplink and downlink. The high-level objective is to design a simple admission scheme for the uplink that ensures adequate signal-to-interference ratios for both the incoming call (if accepted), as well as previously admitted calls. Our approach is based on two key ideas: (a) a measure of resource utilization that is independent of how resources are allocated among the ongoing calls, and (b) an estimate of the additional resources required because of the new call seeking admission. The current work considers measurement of the received interference power distribution and estimation of its displacement as a result of admitting a new call. The interference distribution is obtained from the power control module. The interference displacement is estimated based on the characteristics of the incoming call and the current resource utilization. Dynamic call capacities are compared with static capacities to indicate the effectiveness of the algorithm in achieving high network utilization with low probability of overload.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Call admission on the uplink of a CDMA system based on total received power","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Communications (Cat.

Traditional ways to obtain the forward Erlang capacity can be too time-consuming by large scale simulations or not sufficiently accurate by table-lookup with weighted averaged number of users per cell. This paper presents a semi-analytical methodology to evaluate the Erlang capacity by iterative assessment of conditional probability distribution of traffic loading through all possible scenarios. Necessary statistics such as soft handoff and power consumption based on geometry are obtained via deployment-based simulation. A numerical evaluation is performed on the newly proposed cdma2000 system to demonstrate the methodology.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1999.765442","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Communications (Cat.

In this paper, we propose two new frequency selection strategies to select the FDD-CDMA channel (forward link f/sub F/ or reverse link f/sub R/) for TDD-CDMA picocell operation in a FDD-CDMA macrocellular network. One is random selection strategy (RSS) which chooses f/sub F/ or f/sub R/ in a random fashion, and the other one is distance based selection strategy (DBSS) which applies a cell partitioning structure to divide each macrocell into an inner tier and an outer tier. With two separated carrier frequencies (f/sub F/ and f/sub R/), the inner tier of each macrocell can use one of these two frequencies, while the outer tier can use the other one. The outage performance of the hybrid TDD/FDD-CDMA network employing the above strategies is studied through computer simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency selection strategies for hybrid TDD/FDD-CDMA cellular networks","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Communications (Cat.

The MA technique in this paper treats time, frequency and user signature sequences as a common resource to all users in the system. The only separation between users is accomplished by the use of a TCM (trellis coded modulation) scheme which is unique for each individual user. This access method is called trellis coded multiple access (TCMA). Assuming an additive, white and Gaussian (AWGN) channel, optimal (in the maximum likelihood sequence detection, MLSD, sense) multi-user detection is considered. The detection performance for each user is investigated using the union bound evaluated through a generalization of the transfer function (TF) approach and also by means of simulations. This paper outlines the analysis method and also gives some numerical results for TCMA systems having two or four users. The modulation is chosen to be M-ary phase shift keying (MPSK) for all users and it is possible that all users share the same modulation as well as having the same envelope magnitude. Thus, the only feature specific for each user is the choice of the convolutional encoder component in this case.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1999.765488","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1999.765488","startPage":"1177","endPage":"1181 vol.2","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Communications (Cat.

We describe two schemes for \"turbo\"-TCM which have been shown to achieve decoding results close to the Shannon limit in AWGN channels. These turbo-TCM schemes are concatenated to space-time block codes. The MAP decoding algorithm is described. We also discuss a feedback to the space-time block decoder.

Soft-output information extracted from modified EEPR4ML is used. To achieve as high a total coding rate as possible, a 16/17MTR(3;11) code and a rate 544/561 cyclic redundancy check code (CRCC) are combined. CRCC-false-correction deteriorates erasure error correction performance. To solve this problem, a method for detecting CRCC-false-correction has been proposed.

A simplified serial concatenation system is presented that uses as its outer code a single convolutional code and as its inner code the partial response channel. An extension of this serial concatenation system is also presented that combines a second code with the channel, forming a more powerful inner code. Both proposed systems require only two APP detectors, offering significant savings in complexity and computation time. These serial concatenation systems are shown to perform as well as the more complicated parallel concatenation systems, offering substantial gains over uncoded systems.

Nevertheless, plain computation of the MTIE standard estimator proves cumbersome in most cases of practical interest, due to its heavy computational weight. In this paper, MTIE is first introduced according to its standard definition. Then, a fast algorithm based on binary decomposition to compute the MTIE standard estimator is described. The computational weight of the binary decomposition algorithm is compared to that of the estimator plain calculation, showing that the number of operations needed is reduced to a term proportional to Nlog/sub 2/N instead of N/sup 2/. A heavy computational saving is therefore achieved, thus making feasible MTIE evaluation based on even long sequences of time error (TE) samples. The algorithm proposed is finally applied to TE sequences generated by simulation of all the types of power-law noise, in order to check its effectiveness and correctness.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1999.765539","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Communications (Cat.

Constellation shaping reduces average signal energy by a non-uniform distribution of constellation point utilization. Optimal transmit efficiency is achieved by a Gaussian distribution but many blind equalization algorithms require a non-Gaussian source. We demonstrate, using complex constellations, MMA convergence failure as a Gaussian source kurtosis is approached. Our generalized cost function analysis of the related constant modulus algorithm (CMA) for complex constellations identifies the mechanism of the MMA convergence failure. We introduce a new design procedure for determining the kurtosis-specific MMA moduli and present simulation results that illustrate MMA convergence properties for varying source kurtosis.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1999.765547","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Communications (Cat.

Then the capacity region for the number of simultaneous calls in every cell is defined for specified system parameters. This region is used to evaluate the new call blocking and handoff call blocking probabilities. The network throughput is found by considering the revenue generated by accepting a new call and the cost of a forced termination due to handoff failure. Implied costs are calculated for both high and low mobility of calls between cells, and the effect of mobility on pricing is discussed. Implied costs are used to maximize the throughput with respect to the call arrival rates by applying a gradient descent algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Communications (Cat.

The method uses a recurrent neural network tailored to the used convolutional code. No supervision is required. As an example, decoders for 1/2 and 1/3 rate convolutional codes with constraint length 9 are studied. Such codes have been proposed, e.g., for the third generation WCDMA cellular system. The new decoders have been tested in a Gaussian channel and it is shown that the performance of the Viterbi algorithm can be approached very closely. The decoder lends itself to pleasing implementations in hardware. Its complexity increases only polynomially with increasing constraint length, which is slower than the exponential increase of the Viterbi algorithm. However, the speed of the current circuits may set limits to the codes used. With increasing speeds of the circuits in the future, the proposed technique may become a tempting choice for decoding convolutional coding with long constraint lengths.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Convolutional codes","Viterbi algorithm","Circuits","Recurrent neural networks","Multiaccess communication","Testing","Gaussian channels","Hardware","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","computational complexity","decoding","Gaussian channels","recurrent neural nets","code division multiple access","broadband networks","cellular radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural decoder","convolutional codes","third generation WCDMA cellular system","Gaussian channel","Viterbi algorithm","implementation","complexity","constraint length","CDMA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=765550","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1999.765550","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Communications (Cat.

One major technical challenge of CDMA cellular-based location systems has been recognized as the near-far (hearability) problem. In this paper, we propose a novel cellular-based location system, the enhanced measurement on pilots channels, to overcome this problem without affecting the capacity of the existing cellular communication systems. The basic idea is to enhance the hearability of pilots by increasing the integration time at the correlator. The limitation on the integration time is analyzed and the feasibility of the enhanced measurement system is demonstrated by a numerical example. It is shown that the location system performance is a tradeoff between the estimation accuracy, processing time, and the coverage area.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Communications (Cat.

In this case, since neighboring BS use different spreading sequences, the mobile must first determine the spreading sequence being used by the base station(s) from which the mobile receives sufficiently strong signals. To facilitate acquisition, the total set of spreading sequences is divided into groups, and the group identification is transmitted over a synchronization channel. This paper describes a novel mechanism for transmitting the group ID using cyclically permutable (CP) codes; this scheme results in significant reduction in the search space, allowing for rapid acquisition. The technique described is currently a component of the ARIB and ETSI proposals to the ITU, for third generation wireless systems (IMT-2000).","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1999.765597","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Communications (Cat.

Statistical models characterizing traffic generated by variable-bit-rate (VBR) video coders are needed to address packet video per formance issues such as predicting cell loss rates in ATM networks. For video teleconference traffic, it has been shown that traffic is sufficiently accurately characterized by a multi-state Markov chain model that can be derived from three traffic parameters (mean, correlation, and variance). In this talk, we describe modeling results for sequences with frequent scene changes (the previously studied video teleconferences have very little scene variation) such as entertainment television, news, and sports. We analyze 11 long sequences. Our conclusion is that different sequences require different details regarding distributions of cells per frame and that a single model based on a few physically meaningful parameters and applicable to all sequences does not seem to be available.","doi":"10.1109/CAMAD.1994.765640","publicationTitle":"Fifth IEEE International Workshop on Computer-Aided Modeling, Analysis, and Design of Communication Links and Networks","startPage":"0_33","endPage":"0_33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMAD.1994.765640","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16525","pdfPath":"/iel5/6193/16525/00765640.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth IEEE International Workshop on Computer-Aided Modeling, Analysis, and Design of Communication Links and Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Statistical analysis","Analytical models","Broadcasting","Traffic control","Telecommunication traffic","Asynchronous transfer mode","Multimedia communication","Teleconferencing","Layout","Predictive models"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Statistical analysis and simulation study of VBR broadcast-video traffic","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/765640/","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"24-27 April 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 April 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical analysis and simulation study of VBR broadcast-video traffic","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00765640.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.015225S","chronDate":"24-27 April 1994","isNumber":"16525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6193","citationCount":"2","articleId":"765640","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":765652,"authors":[{"name":"D.L.

We describe a hierarchical database structure for image retrieval. The self-organizing hierarchical optimal subspace learning and inference framework (SHOSLIF) system uses the theories of optimal linear projection for optimal feature derivation and a hierarchical structure to achieve logarithmic retrieval complexity. A space-tessellation tree is generated using the most expressive features (MEF) and most discriminating features (MDF) at each level of the tree. The major characteristics of the analysis include: (1) avoiding the limitation of global linear features by deriving a recursively better-fitted set of features for each of the recursively subdivided sets of training samples; (2) generating a smaller tree whose cell boundaries separate the samples along the class boundaries better than the principal component analysis, thereby giving a better generalization capability (i.e., better recognition rate in a disjoint test); (3) accelerating the retrieval using a tree structure for data pruning, utilizing a different set of discriminant features at each level of the tree. We allow for perturbations in the size and position of objects in the images through learning. We demonstrate the technique on a large image database of widely varying real-world objects taken in natural settings, and show the applicability of the approach for variability in position, size, and 3D orientation. This paper concentrates on the hierarchical partitioning of the feature spaces.","doi":"10.1109/34.765652","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/16576/00765652.pdf","startPage":"386","endPage":"401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.765652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical discriminant analysis for image retrieval","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/765652/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical discriminant analysis for image retrieval","volume":"21","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6267927","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical discriminant analysis for image retrieval","sourcePdf":"00765652.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048303S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"64","articleId":"765652","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-16"},{"_id":765653,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The adaptation of the masks produces a numerical vector representing each fingerprint as a multidimensional point, which can be conceived as a continuous classification. Different search strategies are discussed to efficiently retrieve fingerprints both with continuous and exclusive classification.

For instance, this set may represent many visual appearances of an object, a face, or a hand. We address the problem of approximating this set by a manifold in order to have a compact representation of the object appearance. When the scattering of this set is approximately an ellipsoid, then the problem has a well-known solution given by principal components analysis (PCA). However, in some situations like object displacement learning or face learning, this linear technique may be ill-adapted and nonlinear approximation has to be introduced. The method we propose can be seen as a nonlinear PCA (NLPCA), the main difficulty being that the data are not ordered. We propose an index which favors the choice of axes preserving the closest point neighborhoods. These axes determine an order for visiting all the points when smoothing. Finally, a new criterion, called \"generalization error\", is introduced to determine the smoothing rate, that is, the knot number for the spline fitting. Experimental results conclude this paper: The method is tested on artificial data and on two databases used in visual learning.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scattering","Shape","Principal component analysis","Smoothing methods","Ellipsoids","Fitting","Information analysis","Pattern analysis","Clouds","Spline"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern recognition","principal component analysis","learning (artificial intelligence)","smoothing methods","generalisation (artificial intelligence)","splines (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear modeling","scattered multivariate data","shape change","high-dimensional space","object appearance","ellipsoid","principal components analysis","object displacement learning","face learning","nonlinear approximation","nonlinear PCA","NLPCA","closest point neighborhood preservation","smoothing","generalization error","knot number","spline fitting","databases","visual learning"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16576","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.765654","startPage":"422","endPage":"432","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/16576/00765654.pdf","doi":"10.1109/34.765654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear modeling of scattered multivariate data and its application to shape change","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear modeling of scattered multivariate data and its application to shape change","accessionNumber":"6267929","publicationDate":"May 1999","volume":"21","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/765654/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear modeling of scattered multivariate data and its application to shape change","sourcePdf":"00765654.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06344S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"32","articleId":"765654","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":765655,"authors":[{"name":"A.E.

Furthermore, we demonstrate the robust performance of recognition in the presence of clutter and occlusion through analysis of recognition trials on 100 scenes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/765655/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","volume":"21","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"6267930","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Using spin images for efficient object recognition in cluttered 3D scenes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using spin images for efficient object recognition in cluttered 3D scenes","sourcePdf":"00765655.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033664S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"1652","articleId":"765655","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":765656,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The proposed robust competitive agglomeration (RCA) algorithm starts with a large number of clusters to reduce the sensitivity to initialization, and determines the actual number of clusters by a process of competitive agglomeration. Noise immunity is achieved by incorporating concepts from robust statistics into the algorithm. RCA assigns two different sets of weights for each data point: the first set of constrained weights represents degrees of sharing, and is used to create a competitive environment and to generate a fuzzy partition of the data set. The second set corresponds to robust weights, and is used to obtain robust estimates of the cluster prototypes. By choosing an appropriate distance measure in the objective function, RCA can be used to find an unknown number of clusters of various shapes in noisy data sets, as well as to fit an unknown number of parametric models simultaneously. Several examples, such as clustering/mixture decomposition, line/plane fitting, segmentation of range images, and estimation of motion parameters of multiple objects, are shown.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/765656/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"21","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6267931","displayDocTitle":"A robust competitive clustering algorithm with applications in computer vision","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust competitive clustering algorithm with applications in computer vision","sourcePdf":"00765656.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051483S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"343","articleId":"765656","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":765658,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Theself-routing switch enables high-speed, high quality switching by hardware processing. Various self-routing switches have been studied. One of the typical self-routing switches is the Batcher-Banyan network. The primary objective of our study was to develop a switch for ATM switching. In this paper we propose a new switch which is designed to improve the throughput of the Batcher-Banyan network, and present the results obtained using a prototype of the proposed switch. The switch proposed in this paper is the NEMAWASHI switch. It features cell arbitration using sorters with input buffers. This enables us to achieve non-blocking high switching performance. By stacking the basic switch unit, a larger switch can be constructed. We constructed a prototype switching system which uses a NEMAWASHI switch with LSIs, and performed actual switching of voice and video data to verify the effectiveness of the system.","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00765800.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISS.1990.765800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16564","publicationTitle":"International Symposium on Switching","displayPublicationTitle":"International Symposium on Switching","pdfPath":"/iel5/6164/16564/00765800.pdf","endPage":"14","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Atm switch for multi-media switching system","doi":"10.1109/ISS.1990.765800","startPage":"9","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=765800","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1990","displayDocTitle":"Atm switch for multi-media switching system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/765800/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","conferenceDate":"27 May-1 June 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Atm switch for multi-media switching system","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00765800.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038076S","chronDate":"1990","isNumber":"16564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6164","citationCount":"10","articleId":"765800","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":765915,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Furthermore, it should be emphasized that it is not required to have a very close initial guess of the parameters for solution convergence, unlike other algorithms used at present. In order to check the validity of the proposed algorithm in finding the elementary components of a mixed Weibull function, many PD experimental tests have been performed on some lumped capacitance specimens in order to compare the experimental cumulative probability of pulse amplitude distributions (PAD) with the ones obtained from the Weibull analysis. In this aim, the results of the Cramer Von Mises (CVM) test performed on the experimental results are reported.

Traditional processors for sequential programs maintain the abstraction of a unified memory by using a single centralized memory system. This implementation leads to the infamous \"Von Neumann bottleneck,\" with machine performance limited by the large memory latency and limited memory bandwidth. A Raw architecture addresses this problem by taking advantage of the rapidly increasing transistor budget to move much of its memory on chip. To remove the bottleneck and complexity associated with centralized memory, Raw distributes the memory with its processing elements. Unified memory semantics are implemented jointly by the hardware and the compiler. The hardware provides a clean compiler interface to its two inter-tile interconnects: a fast, statically schedulable network and a traditional dynamic network. Maps then uses these communication mechanisms to orchestrate the memory accesses for low latency and parallelism while enforcing proper dependence. It optimizes for speed in two ways: by finding accesses that can be scheduled on the static interconnect through static promotion, and by minimizing dependence sequentialization for the remaining accesses. Static promotion is performed using equivalence class unification and module unrolling: memory dependences are enforced through explicit synchronization and software serial ordering. We have implemented Maps based on the SUIF infrastructure. This paper demonstrates that the exclusive use of static promotion yields roughly 20-fold speedup on 32 tiles for our regular applications and about 5-fold speedup on 16 or more tiles for our irregular applications. The paper also shows that selective use of dynamic accesses can be a useful complement to the mostly static memory system.","doi":"10.1109/ISCA.1999.765935","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 26th International Symposium on Computer Architecture (Cat.

In an out-of-order engine, the instruction scheduler is responsible for dispatching instructions to execution units based on dependencies, latencies, and resource availability. Most existing instruction schedulers are doing a less than optimal job of scheduling memory accesses and instructions dependent on them, for the following reasons: Memory dependencies cannot be resolved prior to execution, so loads are not advanced ahead of preceding stores. The dynamic latencies of load instructions are unknown, so scheduling dependent instructions is based on either optimistic load-use delay (may cause re-scheduling and re-execution) or pessimistic delay (creating unnecessary delays). Memory pipelines are more expensive than other execution units, and as such, are a scarce resource. Currently, an increase in the memory execution bandwidth is usually achieved through multi-banked caches where bank conflicts limit efficiency. In this paper we present three techniques to address these scheduler limitations. One is to improve the scheduling of load instructions by using a simple memory disambiguation mechanism. The second is to improve the scheduling of load dependent instructions by employing a Data Cache Hit-Miss Predictor to predict the dynamic load latencies. And the third is to improve the efficiency of load scheduling in a multi-banked cache through cache-bank prediction.","doi":"10.1109/ISCA.1999.765938","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 26th International Symposium on Computer Architecture (Cat.

Bigger and faster caches significantly reduce the absolute load-to-use time delay. However, increase in processor operational frequencies impairs the relative load-to-use latency, measured in processor cycles (e.g. from two cycles on the Pentium processor to three cycles of more in current designs). Load-address prediction techniques were introduced to partially cut the load-to-use latency. This paper focuses on advanced address-prediction schemes to further shorten program execution time. Existing address prediction schemes are capable of predicting simple address patterns, consisting mainly of constant addresses or stride-based addresses. This paper explores the characteristics of the remaining loads and suggests new enhanced techniques to improve prediction effectiveness: Context-based prediction to tackle part of the remaining, difficult-to-predict, load instructions. New prediction algorithms to take advantage of global correlation among different static loads. New confidence mechanisms to increase the correct prediction rate and to eliminate costly mispredictions. Mechanisms to prevent long or random address sequences from polluting the predictor data structures while providing some hysteresis behavior to the predictions. Such an enhanced address predictor accurately predicts 67% of all loads, while keeping the misprediction rate close to 1% We further prove that the proposed predictor works reasonably well in a deep pipelined architecture where the predict-to-update delay may significantly impair both prediction rate and accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/765939/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","publicationDate":"1999","conferenceDate":"4-4 May 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6346051","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Correlated load-address predictors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correlated load-address predictors","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00765939.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04161S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"16584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6210","citationCount":"49","articleId":"765939","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":765940,"authors":[{"name":"B.

We examine prediction and confidence mechanisms in light of these constraints, and we minimize capacity conflicts through instruction filtering. The latter technique filters which instructions put values into the value prediction table. We examine filtering techniques based on instruction type, as well as giving priority to instructions belonging to the longest data dependence path in the processor's active instruction window. We apply filtering both to the producers of predicted values and the consumers. In addition, we examine the benefit of using different confidence levels for instructions using predicted values on the longest dependence path.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective value prediction","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 26th International Symposium on Computer Architecture (Cat.

This paper describes a framework for jump-pointer prefetching (JPP) that supports four prefetching idioms: queue, full, chain, and root jumping and three implementations: software-only, hardware-only, and a cooperative software/hardware technique. On a suite of pointer intensive programs, jump-pointer prefetching reduces memory stall time by 72% for software, 83% for cooperative and 55% for hardware, producing speedups of 15%, 20% and 22% respectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective jump-pointer prefetching for linked data structures","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 26th International Symposium on Computer Architecture (Cat.

We use detailed simulation of 12 benchmarks to study the effectiveness of current architectural features and identify future challenges for these workloads. Our results show that conventional techniques in current processors to enhance instruction-level parallelism (ILP) provide a factor of 2.3 X to 4.2 X performance improvement. The Sun VIS media ISA extensions provide an additional 1.1 X to 4.2 X performance improvement. The ILP features and media ISA extensions significantly reduce the CPU component of execution time, making 5 of the image processing benchmarks memory-bound. The memory behavior of our benchmarks is characterized by large working sets and streaming data accesses. Increasing the cache size has no impact on 8 of the benchmarks. The remaining benchmarks require relatively large cache sizes (dependent on the display sizes) to exploit data reuse, but derive less than 1.2 X performance benefits with the larger caches. Software prefetching provides 1.4 X to 2.5 X performance improvement in the image processing benchmarks where memory is a significant problem. With the addition of software prefetching, all our benchmarks revert to being compute-bound.","pdfPath":"/iel5/6210/16584/00765945.pdf","startPage":"124","endPage":"135","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 26th International Symposium on Computer Architecture (Cat.

We propose Simultaneous Subordinate Microthreading (SSMT) to correct this by spawning subordinate threads that perform optimizations on behalf of the single primary thread. These threads, written in microcode, are issued and executed concurrently with the primary thread. They directly manipulate the microarchitecture to improve the primary thread's branch prediction accuracy, cache hit rate, and prefetch effectiveness. All contribute to the performance of the primary thread. This paper introduces SSMT and discusses its potential to increase performance. We illustrate its usefulness with an SSMT machine that executes subordinate microthreads to improve the branch prediction of the primary thread. We show simulation results for the SPECint95 benchmarks.","doi":"10.1109/ISCA.1999.765950","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 26th International Symposium on Computer Architecture (Cat.

The study covers Fast Page Mode, Extended Data Out, Synchronous, Enhanced Synchronous, Synchronous Link, Rambus, and Direct Rambus designs. Our simulations reveal several things: (a) current advanced DRAM technologies are attacking the memory bandwidth problem but not the latency problem; (b) bus transmission speed will soon become a primary factor limiting memory-system performance; (c) the post-12 address stream still contains significant locality, though it varies from application to application; and (d) as we move to wider buses, row access time becomes more prominent, making it important to investigate techniques to exploit the available locality to decrease access time.","doi":"10.1109/ISCA.1999.765953","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCA.1999.765953","startPage":"222","endPage":"233","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 26th International Symposium on Computer Architecture (Cat.

Conventional architectures for enhancing cache reliability using check codes make it difficult to trade between the level of data integrity and the chip area requirement. We focus on transient fault tolerance in primary cache memories and develop new architectural solutions to maximize fault coverage when the budgeted silicon area is not sufficient for the conventional configuration of an error checking code. The underlying idea is to exploit the corollary of reference locality in the organization and management of the code. A higher protection priority is dynamically assigned to the portions of the cache that are more error-prone and have a higher probability of access. The error-prone likelihood prediction is based on the access frequency. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes using a trace-driven simulation combined with software error injection using four different fault manifestation models. From the simulation results, we show that for most benchmarks the proposed architectures are effective and area efficient for increasing the cache integrity under all four models.","doi":"10.1109/ISCA.1999.765955","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 26th International Symposium on Computer Architecture (Cat.

Two different training algorithms, viz., backpropagation (BP) and Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), were employed. The accuracy of the networks studied ranged from 96.68 to 98.8%. The networks trained with LM algorithm were faster. It is concluded that neural networks can be used as a paradigm in soil classification as well as in predicting the quantity of soil moisture and temperature accurately, using remotely sensed microwave data, and thus helps achieve a proper crop management.","doi":"10.1109/SECON.1999.766079","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00766079.png","startPage":"10","endPage":"13","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE Southeastcon'99.

We propose reverse computation as an alternative approach, and compare its execution performance against that of state-saving. Using compiler techniques, we describe an approach to automatically generate reversible computations, and to optimize them to transparently reap the performance benefits of reverse computation. For certain fine-grain models, such as queuing network models, we show that reverse computation can yield significant improvement in execution speed coupled with significant reduction in memory utilization, as compared to traditional state-saving. On sample models using reverse computation, we observe as much as three-fold improvement in execution speed over traditional state-saving.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/766169/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-4 May 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6314491","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Efficient optimistic parallel simulations using reverse computation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient optimistic parallel simulations using reverse computation","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00766169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02456S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"16596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6213","citationCount":"18","articleId":"766169","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":766206,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Consequently, understanding, modelling and detection of plasma charging induced gate oxide damage in real ICs is often inadequate. This paper discusses a new plasma charging monitoring technique that assesses the extent of this problem. This technique employs a multiplexed antenna monitoring (MAM) test structure with more than 400 antenna configurations in order to determine the dependency between IC layout and the extent of gate oxide damage. The paper reports the results of application of this technique to a 0.35 /spl mu/m, 75 /spl Aring/ gate oxide CMOS technology. The obtained results lead to a new definition of \"antenna ratio\" which is proposed to capture plasma charging conditions in real VLSI devices.","doi":"10.1109/ICMTS.1999.766206","publicationTitle":"ICMTS 1999.

We propose the Globus Architecture for Reservation and Allocation (GARA) to address these four issues. GARA treats both reservations and computational elements such as processes, network flows, and memory blocks as first-class entities, allowing them to be created, monitored, and managed independently and uniformly. It simplifies management of heterogeneous resource types by defining uniform mechanisms for computers, networks, disk, memory, and other resources. Layering on these standard mechanisms, GARA enables the construction of application-level co-reservation and co-allocation libraries that applications can use to dynamically assemble collections of resources, guided by both application QoS requirements and the local administration policy of individual resources. We describe a prototype GARA implementation that supports three different resource type-parallel computers, individual CPU under control of the dynamic soft real-time scheduler, and integrated services networks, and provide performance results that quantify the costs of our techniques.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16606","publicationTitle":"1999 Seventh International Workshop on Quality of Service.

The World-Wide Web provides a uniform and widely-accepted application interface used by these services to reach multitudes of clients. These changes place the Web server at the center of a gradually emerging E-service infrastructure with increasing requirements for service quality, reliability, and security guarantees in an unpredictable and highly dynamic environment. Towards that end, we introduce a Web server QoS provisioning architecture for performance differentiation among classes of clients, performance isolation among independent services, and capacity planning to provide QoS guarantees on request rate and delivered bandwidth. We present a new approach to Web server resource management based on Web content adaptation. This approach subsumes traditional admission control-based techniques and enhances server performance by selectively adapting content in accordance with both load conditions and QoS requirements. Our QoS management solutions can be implemented either in middleware transparent to the server or by direct modification of the server software. We present experimental data to illustrate the practicality of our approach.","doi":"10.1109/IWQOS.1999.766497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16606","startPage":"216","endPage":"225","pdfPath":"/iel5/6221/16606/00766497.pdf","publicationTitle":"1999 Seventh International Workshop on Quality of Service.

The proposed technique embeds a precomputed deterministic test set for the circuit under test (CUT) in a short test sequence produced by a TRC. The TRC is designed using existing circuit flip-flops and does not add to hardware overhead beyond what is required for basic scan design. The test control logic is simple, uniform for all circuits, and can be shared among multiple CUTs. Furthermore, the proposed method requires no mapping logic between the TGC and the CUT; it imposes no additional performance penalty. Experimental results for the ISCAS benchmark circuits show that it is indeed possible to embed the entire precomputed test set in a TRC sequence using only a small number of seeds, especially if the test set contains many don't-cares.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 17th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (Cat.

The effects of various noise sources are becoming of great concern. In particularly, it is predicted that single event upsets induced by alpha particles and cosmic radiation will become a cause of unacceptable error rates in future very deep submicron and nanometer technologies. This problem, concerning in the past more often parts used in space, will affect future ICs at sea level. This challenging problem has to be solved otherwise technological progress will be blocked soon. Thus, fault tolerant design is becoming necessary, even for commodity applications. But economic constraints of commodity applications exclude the use of traditional, high-cost fault tolerant techniques.

The test vectors provided by the core vendor are stored in compressed form in the tester memory and transferred to the chip where they are decompressed and applied to the core. Given the set of test vectors for a core, a statistical code is carefully selected so that it satisfies certain properties. These properties guarantee that it can be decoded by a simple pipelined decoder (placed at the serial input of the core's scan chain) which requires very small area. Results indicate that the proposed scheme can use a simple decoder to provide test data compression near that of an optimal Huffman code.

Many applications need protection against up to t unidirectional errors, while some others against burst unidirectional errors. Bose-Lin codes are systematic t-unidirectional error detecting codes while Bose codes are burst unidirectional error detecting codes. In this paper we propose a modular method for designing double output checkers for Bose-Lin and Bose codes. The proposed checkers are Totally Self Checking (TSC) with respect to a realistic fault model including stuck-at, transistor stuck-open, transistor stuck-on, resistive bridging faults and breaks. The method is applicable to every code information length and the checkers are very compact and fast.","doi":"10.1109/VTEST.1999.766689","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 17th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (Cat.

A Berger code is a special member of this proposed class of codes where each output bit is assigned a weight of one. This paper describes the application of these codes for the efficient on-line error detection of arbitrary multilevel circuits. The overall probability of detecting any number of erroneous bits at the output caused by a single internal fault is shown to be higher for weight-based codes than standard error detecting codes. Further, a very efficient design exists for the checker. The checker is area and speed efficient, has low power consumption, and can be tested by a small set of incoming code words. There is always a tradeoff between the fault detection capability and area overhead requirement of an error detecting code. Weight-based codes present a controlled way of increasing the number of check bits to achieve a desired fault detection capability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/766691/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"6450984","conferenceDate":"25-29 April 1999","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Weight-based codes and their application to concurrent error detection of multilevel circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weight-based codes and their application to concurrent error detection of multilevel circuits","confLoc":"Dana Point, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00766691.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0447S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"16582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6209","citationCount":"33","articleId":"766691","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":766693,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In the first part of this paper, we propose a test vector inhibiting technique which tackles the increased activity during test operation. Next, a mixed solution based on a reseeding scheme and the vector inhibiting technique is proposed to deal with hard-to-test circuits that contain pseudo-random resistant faults. From a general point of view, the goal of these techniques is to minimize the total energy consumption during test and to allow the test at system speed in order to achieve high fault coverage.

Consequently, estimation of leakage current and identification of minimum and maximum leakage conditions are becoming important, especially in low power applications. In this paper we outline methods for estimating leakage at the circuit level and then propose heuristic and exact algorithms to accomplish the same task for random combinational logic. In most cases the heuristic is found to obtain bounds on leakage that are close and often identical to bounds determined by a complete branch and bound search. Methods are also demonstrated to show how estimation accuracy can be traded off against execution time. The proposed algorithms have potential application in power management applications or quiescent current (I/sub D/DQ) testing if one wished to control leakage by application of appropriate input vectors. For a variety of benchmark circuits, leakage was found to vary by as much as a factor of six over the space of possible input vectors.","doi":"10.1109/43.766723","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/16613/00766723.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.766723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16613","startPage":"714","endPage":"725","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Models and algorithms for bounds on leakage in CMOS circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=766723","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Models and algorithms for bounds on leakage in CMOS circuits","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/766723/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1999","accessionNumber":"6270837","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Models and algorithms for bounds on leakage in CMOS circuits","sourcePdf":"00766723.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033365S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"143","articleId":"766723","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":766724,"authors":[{"name":"C.H.

We show that the problem can be formulated as a convex quadratic program, which is known to be solvable in polynomial time. Nevertheless, we explore some special properties of our problem and derive an optimal and very efficient algorithm, modified active set method (MASM), to solve the resulting program. Given m buffers and a set of m discrete choices of wire width, the running time of our algorithm is O(mn/sup 2/) and is independent of the wire length in practice. For example, an instance of 100 buffers and 100 choices of wire width can be solved in 0.92 s. In addition, we extend MASM to consider simultaneous buffer insertion, buffer sizing, and wire sizing. The resulting algorithm MASM-BS is again optimal and very efficient. For example, with six choices of buffer size and 10 choices of wire width, the optimal solution for a 15000 /spl mu/m long wire can be found in 0.05 s. Besides, our formulation is so versatile that it is easy to consider other objectives like wire area or power dissipation, or to add constraints to the solution. Also, wire capacitance lookup tables, or very general wire capacitance models which can capture area capacitance, fringing capacitance, coupling capacitance, etc. can be used.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/766728/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","volume":"18","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1999","accessionNumber":"6270842","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"A quadratic programming approach to simultaneous buffer insertion/sizing and wire sizing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A quadratic programming approach to simultaneous buffer insertion/sizing and wire sizing","sourcePdf":"00766728.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038251S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"31","articleId":"766728","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":766730,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In a power-managed system it is possible to set components into different states, each characterized by performance and power consumption levels. The main function of a power management policy is to decide when to perform component state transitions and which transition should be performed, depending on system history, workload, and performance constraints. In the past, power management policies have been formulated heuristically. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a finite-state, abstract system model for power-managed systems based on Markov decision processes. Under this model, the problem of finding policies that optimally tradeoff performance for power can be cast as a stochastic optimization problem and solved exactly and efficiently. The applicability and generality of the approach are assessed by formulating the Markov model and optimizing power management policies for several systems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.766730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16613","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/16613/00766730.pdf","endPage":"833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Policy optimization for dynamic power management","doi":"10.1109/43.766730","startPage":"813","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=766730","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","displayDocTitle":"Policy optimization for dynamic power management","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/766730/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6270844","publicationDate":"June 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"18","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Policy optimization for dynamic power management","sourcePdf":"00766730.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039042S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"281","articleId":"766730","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":766733,"authors":[{"name":"Peixin Zhong","affiliation":["Microelectronics Group, Lucent Technologies, Inc., Allentown, PA, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Peixin Zhong","id":"37274513700"},{"name":"M.

As field-programmable gate array (FPGA) speeds and densities increase, the opportunity for effective hardware accelerators built from FPGA technology has opened up. This paper describes and evaluates a formula-specific method for implementing Boolean satisfiability solver circuits in configurable hardware. That is, using a template generator, we create circuits specific to the problem instance to be solved. This approach yields impressive runtime speedups of up to several hundred times compared to the software approaches. The high performance comes from realizing fine-grained parallelism inherent in the clause evaluation and implication and from direct mapping of Boolean relations into logic gates. Our implementation uses a commercially available hardware system for proof of concept. This system yields more than 100 times run-time speedup on many problems, even though the clock rate of the hardware is 100 times slower than that of the workstation running the software solver. While the time to compile the solver circuit to configurable hardware can he quite long on current platforms (20-40 min per chip), this paper discusses new approaches to overcome this compilation overhead. More broadly, we view this work as a case study in the burgeoning domain of high performance configurable computing. Our approach realizes large amount of fine-grained parallelism, and has broad applications in the very large scale integration CAD area.","doi":"10.1109/43.766733","startPage":"861","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/16613/00766733.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.766733","endPage":"868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using configurable computing to accelerate Boolean satisfiability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/766733/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","displayDocTitle":"Using configurable computing to accelerate Boolean satisfiability","volume":"18","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6270847","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using configurable computing to accelerate Boolean satisfiability","sourcePdf":"00766733.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05126S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"25","articleId":"766733","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":766734,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Compared with conventional digital technology, cellular neural/nonlinear network (CNN)-based computing is capable of realizing these TeraOPS-range image processing tasks in a cost-effective implementation. To exploit the computing power of the CNN Universal Machine (CNN-UM), the CNN chipset architecture has been developed-a mixed-signal hardware platform for CNN-based image processing. One of the nonstandard components of the chipset is the cache memory of the analog array processor, the analog random access memory (ARAM). This paper reports on an ARAM chip that has been designed and fabricated in a 0.5-/spl mu/m CMOS technology. This chip consists of a fully addressable array of 32/spl times/256 analog memory registers and has a packing density of 637 analog-memory-cells/mm/sup 2/. Random and nondestructive access of the memory contents is available. Bottom-plate sampling techniques have been employed to eliminate harmonic distortion introduced by signal-dependent feedthrough. Signal coupling and interaction have been minimized by proper layout measures, including the use of protection rings and separate power supplies for the analog and the digital circuitry. This prototype features an equivalent resolution of up to 7 bits-measured by comparing the reconstructed waveform with the original input signal. Measured access times for writing/reading to/from the memory registers are of 200 ns. I/O rates via the l6-line-wide I/O bus exceed 10 Msamples/s. Storage time at room temperature is in the 80 to 100 ms range, without accuracy loss.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An 0.5-/spl mu/m CMOS analog random access memory chip for TeraOPS speed multimedia video processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","doi":"10.1109/6046.766734","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/16619/00766734.pdf","startPage":"121","endPage":"135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/6046.766734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16619","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=766734","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/766734/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","displayDocTitle":"An 0.5-/spl mu/m CMOS analog random access memory chip for TeraOPS speed multimedia video processing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1999","accessionNumber":"6272220","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An 0.5-/spl mu/m CMOS analog random access memory chip for TeraOPS speed multimedia video processing","sourcePdf":"00766734.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063399S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"14","articleId":"766734","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":766738,"authors":[{"name":"Wai-Tian Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Wai-Tian Tan","id":"37272060700"},{"name":"A.

Most scheduling algorithms proposed for either wired or wireless networks were analyzed with homogeneous traffic or multimedia services with simplified traffic models. We analyze our scheduling algorithm with more realistic multimedia traffic models based on H.263 video traces and self-similar data traffic. One of the key goals of the scheduling algorithms is simplicity and fast implementation. Unlike the time-stamped based algorithms, our algorithm does not need to sort the virtual time, and thus, the complexity of the algorithm is reduced significantly.","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/16619/00766739.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"201","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16619","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/6046.766739","doi":"10.1109/6046.766739","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=766739","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Scheduling algorithm","Traffic control","Media Access Protocol","Algorithm design and analysis","Access protocols","Telecommunication traffic","Wireless application protocol","Computer science","Asynchronous transfer mode"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","computational complexity","asynchronous transfer mode","radio access networks","multimedia communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimedia services scheduling","low-power MAC","mobile ATM networks","wireless ATM networks","energy conserving medium access control","protocol","burst errors","location-dependent errors","H.263 video traces","self-similar data traffic","time-stamped based algorithms","complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/766739/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling multimedia services in a low-power MAC for wireless and mobile ATM networks","accessionNumber":"6272225","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1999","volume":"1","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling multimedia services in a low-power MAC for wireless and mobile ATM networks","sourcePdf":"00766739.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053906S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"50","articleId":"766739","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":766741,"authors":[{"name":"Yong He","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Yong He","id":"37362830000"},{"name":"I.

One of the most critical components of an MPEG-4 environment is the system encoder. An MPEG-4 scene may contain several audio and video objects, images, and text, each of which must be encoded individually and then multiplexed to form the system bitstream. Due to its flexible features, object-based nature, and provision for user interaction, MPEG-4 encoder is highly suitable for a software-based implementation. A full-scale software-based MPEG-J system encoder with real-time encoding speed is a nontrivial task and requires massive computation. We have built such an encoder using a cluster of workstations collectively working as a virtual parallel machine. Parallel processing of MPEG-4 encoder needs to be carried out carefully as objects may appear or disappear dynamically in a scene. In addition, objects may be synchronized with each other. User interactions may also prohibit a straightforward parallelization. We propose a modeling methodology that captures the spatio-temporal relationship between various objects and user interaction. We then propose a number of scheduling algorithms that periodically allocate MPEG-4 objects to multiple workstations ensuring load balancing and synchronization requirements among multiple objects. Each scheduling algorithm has its own performance and complexity characteristics. The experimental results, while showing real-time encoding rates, exhibit tradeoffs between load balancing, scheduling overhead cost, and global performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/766741/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"1","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6272227","displayDocTitle":"Real-time interactive MPEG-4 system encoder using a cluster of workstations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time interactive MPEG-4 system encoder using a cluster of workstations","sourcePdf":"00766741.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035483S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"13","articleId":"766741","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":766742,"authors":[{"name":"U.

In this paper, we prove that these universal test sets are much more powerful than implied by the above results. They also constitute complete delay fault test sets for arbitrary UGN implementations of a given function. This is even true for UGN networks which are not completely testable with respect to the gate or path delay fault model. Our ability to prove the temporal correctness of such circuit realizations comes from the fact that we do not argue the correctness of individual paths, but rather complete path systems.","doi":"10.1109/92.766742","startPage":"156","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/16614/00766742.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.766742","endPage":"166","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Universal delay test sets for logic networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/766742/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1999","displayDocTitle":"Universal delay test sets for logic networks","volume":"7","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6287516","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Universal delay test sets for logic networks","sourcePdf":"00766742.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057176S","chronDate":"June  1999","isNumber":"16614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"13","articleId":"766742","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":766746,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Although the literature and data books contain detailed descriptions of these architectures, there is very little information on how the high-level architecture was chosen, and no information on the circuit-level or physical design of the devices. This paper describes the high-level architectural design of a static-random-access memory programmable FPGA. A forthcoming Part II will address the circuit design issues through to the physical layout. The logic block and routing architecture of the FPGA was determined through experimentation with benchmark circuits and custom-built computer-aided design tools. The resulting logic block is an asymmetric tree of four-input lookup tables that are hard-wired together and a segmented routing architecture with a carefully chosen segment length distribution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/766746/","volume":"7","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"6287520","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The design of an SRAM-based field-programmable gate array.

We begin by discussing two types of parallelism available in 2-D data processing, which we call inter-iteration parallelism and inter-operation parallelism. We then present two novel techniques for 2-D retiming that can be used to extract inter-operation parallelism. These two techniques are designed to minimize the amount of memory required to implement a 2-D data-flow graph while maintaining a desired clock rate for the circuit. The first technique is based on an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation of the problem, and is called ILP 2-D retiming. This technique considers the entire 2-D retiming problem as a whole, but long central processing unit times are required if the circuit is large. The second technique, called orthogonal 2-D retiming, is a linear programming formulation which is derived by partitioning ILP 2-D retiming into two parts called s- and a-retiming. This technique finds a solution in polynomial time and is much faster than the ILP 2-D retiming technique, but the two sub problems (s- and a-retiming) can give results which are not compatible with one another. To solve this incompatibility problem, a variation of orthogonal 2-D retiming called integer orthogonal 2-D retiming is developed. This technique runs in polynomial time and the s-retiming and a-retiming steps are guaranteed to give compatible results. We show that the techniques presented in this paper can result in memory hardware savings of 50% compared to previously published 2-D retiming techniques.","doi":"10.1109/92.766747","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/16614/00766747.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.766747","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16614","startPage":"198","endPage":"211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-dimensional retiming [VLSI design]","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=766747","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Two-dimensional retiming [VLSI design]","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/766747/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1999","accessionNumber":"6287521","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-dimensional retiming [VLSI design]","sourcePdf":"00766747.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057422S","chronDate":"June  1999","isNumber":"16614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"6","articleId":"766747","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":766748,"authors":[{"name":"S.

These schemes are suited for high-capacitance buses where the extra power dissipation due to the encoder and decoder circuitry is offset by the power savings at the bus. In this framework, a data source (characterized in a probabilistic manner) is first passed through a decorrelating function f/sub 1/. Next, a variant of entropy coding function f/sub 2/ is employed, which reduces the transition activity. The framework is then employed to derive novel encoding schemes whereby practical forms for f/sub 1/ and f/sub 2/ are proposed. Simulation results with an encoding scheme for data buses indicate an average reduction in transition activity of 36%. This translates into a reduction in total power dissipation for bus capacitances greater than 14 pF/b in 1.2 /spl mu/m CMOS technology. For a typical value for bus capacitance of 50 pF/b, there is a 36% reduction in power dissipation and eight times more power savings compared to existing schemes. Simulation results with an encoding scheme for instruction address buses indicate an average reduction in transition activity by a factor of 1.5 times over known coding schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/766748/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1999","publicationDate":"June 1999","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6287522","volume":"7","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A coding framework for low-power address and data busses","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A coding framework for low-power address and data busses","sourcePdf":"00766748.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065063S","chronDate":"June  1999","isNumber":"16614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"146","articleId":"766748","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":766756,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Yuang Su","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chih-Yuang Su","id":"37337273900"},{"name":"Shih-Am Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shih-Am Hwang","id":"37350506000"},{"name":"Po-Song Chen","affiliation":["Winbond Electronics Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan","Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Po-Song Chen","id":"37351315700"},{"name":"Cheng-Wen Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Cheng-Wen Wu","id":"37276423200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"766756","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":528},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=766756","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Public key cryptography","Transmitters","Very large scale integration","Clocks","Data security","Arithmetic","Logic","Public key","Digital signatures","Councils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed integrated circuits","public key cryptography","cellular arrays","digital arithmetic","VLSI","digital signal processing chips","multiplying circuits","algorithm theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Montgomery algorithm improvement","high-speed cryptosystem","RSA public-key cryptosystem","modular multiplication","cellular array","modular exponentiation","Rivest-Shamir-Adleman cryptosystem","full-adder","100 MHz","100 kbit/s"]}],"abstract":"We revise Montgomery's algorithm such that modular multiplication can be executed two times faster.

It uses fully differential switched-capacitor circuits with a clock frequency of 35.2 MHz, and has a power consumption of 55 mW. Such a low oversampling ratio has been achieved through the combined usage of fourth-order filtering and multibit quantization. To guarantee stable operation for any input signal and/or initial condition, the fourth order shaping function has been realized using a cascade architecture with three stages; the first stage is a second-order modulator, while the others are first-order modulators-referred to as a 2-1-1/sub mb/ architecture. The quantizer of the last stage is 3 bits, while the other quantizers are single bit. The modulator architecture and coefficients have been optimized for reduced sensitivity to the errors in the 3-bit quantization process. Specifically, the 3-bit digital-to-analog converter tolerates 2.8% FS nonlinearity without significant degradation of the modulator performance. This makes the use of digital calibration unnecessary, which is a key point for reduced power consumption. We show that, for a given oversampling ratio and in the presence of 0.5% mismatch, the proposed modulator obtains a larger signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio than previous multibit cascade architectures. On the other hand, as compared to a 2.1.1/sub single-bit/ modulator previously designed for a mixed-signal asymmetrical digital subscriber line modem in the same technology, the modulator in this paper obtains one more bit resolution, enhances the operating frequency by a factor of two, and reduces the power consumption by a factor of four.","doi":"10.1109/4.766809","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/16618/00766809.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.766809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16618","startPage":"748","endPage":"760","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 13-bit, 2.2-MS/s, 55-mW multibit cascade /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulator in CMOS 0.7-/spl mu/m single-poly technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=766809","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 13-bit, 2.2-MS/s, 55-mW multibit cascade /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulator in CMOS 0.7-/spl mu/m single-poly technology","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/766809/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1999","accessionNumber":"6278961","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 13-bit, 2.2-MS/s, 55-mW multibit cascade /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulator in CMOS 0.7-/spl mu/m single-poly technology","sourcePdf":"00766809.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039211S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"47","articleId":"766809","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":766810,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Margarit","affiliation":["Rockwell Semiconductor Systems, Inc., Newport Beach, CA, USA","School of Engineering Science, Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Margarit","id":"37373591200"},{"name":"Joo Leong Tham","affiliation":["Maxim Integrated Products, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Joo Leong Tham","id":"37355158700"},{"name":"R.G.

Its memory cells are made up of high-threshold-voltage (high-V/sub th/) MOSFETs in order to suppress the power dissipation due to large subthreshold leakage currents. For designing peripheral circuitry, we use SRAM's special feature that input signals of each logic gate during the standby time can be predicted. Low-V/sub th/ MOSFETs are assigned for the critical paths of memory-cell access. The leakage current in each logic gate is reduced by high-V/sub th/ MOSFETs, which are cut off during standby. The high-V/sub th/, MOSFET in one logic gate can be shared with another logic gate in order to enlarge effective channel width. To shorten the readout time, a step-down boosted-wordline scheme suitable for current-sense readout and a new half-swing bidirectional double-rail bus are used. The data-writing time is halved by means of a pulse-reset wordline architecture. To reduce the power dissipation, a 32-divided memory array structure is employed with a new redundant address-decoding scheme. Also, data transition detectors and a charge-recycling technique are employed for reducing the power dissipation of data-I/O buffers. A 64-K-words/spl times/16-bits SRAM test chip, which was fabricated with a 0.5-/spl mu/m multithreshold voltage CMOS (MTCMOS) process, has demonstrated a 75-ns address access time at a 1-V power supply. The power dissipation during standby is 1.2 /spl mu/W, and that at a 10-MHz read operation with the modified checkerboard test pattern is 3.9 mW for 30-pF loads.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/766821/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","volume":"34","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"6285304","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A 1-V, 10-MHz, 3.5-mW, 1-Mb MTCMOS SRAM: with charge-recycling input/output buffers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1-V, 10-MHz, 3.5-mW, 1-Mb MTCMOS SRAM: with charge-recycling input/output buffers","sourcePdf":"00766821.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030993S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"14","articleId":"766821","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":766823,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

The influence of higher order effects such as stimulated Raman scattering and third-order fiber dispersion on the pedestal removal from ultrashort pulses are considered, and the effectiveness of using dispersion-flattened fiber within the loop is shown.

We investigate the performance of a 15-MBaud quantenary phase-shift-keying (QPSK) system combined with decision-feedback equalization. The study attempts to identify, and quantify, trends in the system outage performance as a function of the equalizer span, the ensemble averaged RMS-delay-spread (/spl tau/~/sub RMS/) of the environment, and the ensemble averaged input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We introduce a novel figure of merit 99%-SNR-loss, which when plotted as a function of the normalized-equalizer-span shows a trend in the system's outage performance as a function of the desired parameters. These suggest a pattern that can help predict, to the first order, the performance of such a system without the need to resort time-consuming simulations. The results suggest a 0.79-dB improvement in the 99%-SNR-loss per normalized equalizer and a 2-dB improvement with a doubling of /spl tau/~/sub RMS/ with the same normalized equalizer span.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/16617/00766844.pdf","startPage":"125","endPage":"127","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/4234.766844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4234.766844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16617","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=766844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predicting the outage performance of an equalized-QPSK system over indoor wireless channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision feedback equalizers","System performance","Filters","Quadrature phase shift keying","Predictive models","Bit error rate","Field-flow fractionation","Frequency synchronization","Wideband","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadrature phase shift keying","decision feedback equalisers","probability","delays","indoor radio","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalized-QPSK system","indoor wireless channels","outage performance prediction","wide-band wireless indoor systems","low outage probabilities","system performance","performance","quantenary phase-shift-keying","decision-feedback equalization","ensemble averaged RMS-delay-spread","input signal-to-noise ratio","figure of merit","normalized-equalizer-span","SNR-loss"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/766844/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","displayDocTitle":"Predicting the outage performance of an equalized-QPSK system over indoor wireless channels","volume":"3","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6278351","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting the outage performance of an equalized-QPSK system over indoor wireless channels","sourcePdf":"00766844.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040548S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"1","articleId":"766844","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":766845,"authors":[{"name":"M.P.

Buffering of frames allows for the temporal correlation to be made use of, and the larger the buffer the more effective the decomposition. One problem inherent in such a set up in interactive applications such as video conferencing, is that buffering translates into a corresponding time delay. We show that 3-D coding of such image sequences can be achieved in the true sense of temporal direction decomposition but with much less buffering requirements. For a practical coder, this can be achieved by introducing an approximation to the way the transform coefficients are encoded. Applying wavelet decomposition using some types of filters may introduce edge errors, which become more prominent in short signal segments. We also present a solution to this problem for the Daubechies (1988) family of filters.","doi":"10.1109/83.766855","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/16615/00766855.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.766855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16615","startPage":"762","endPage":"773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-dimensional video compression using subband/wavelet transform with lower buffering requirements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=766855","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Three-dimensional video compression using subband/wavelet transform with lower buffering requirements","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/766855/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1999","accessionNumber":"6268814","pubMedId":"18267491","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-dimensional video compression using subband/wavelet transform with lower buffering requirements","sourcePdf":"00766855.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050688S","chronDate":"June  1999","isNumber":"16615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"7","articleId":"766855","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":766860,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Hung Lin","affiliation":["Communication and Multimedia Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chun-Hung Lin","id":"37087169095"},{"name":"Ja-Ling Wu","affiliation":["Communication and Multimedia Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ja-Ling Wu","id":"37087155843"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0042"}],"articleNumber":"766860","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":750},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Facial features","Genetic algorithms","Face detection","Feature extraction","Humans","Data mining","Video coding","Image edge detection","Computational complexity","Face recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","computational complexity","genetic algorithms","image matching","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","automatic facial feature extraction","temple matching","face region estimation","second-chance region growing method","genetic search algorithms","face region","simulation results","computational complexity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=766860","abstract":"An automatic facial feature extraction algorithm is presented.

Deconvolution from multiple blurs is, in general, better conditioned than from a single blur, and can be performed without regularization for moderate noise levels. We characterize the problem of missing data at the image boundaries, and show that perfect reconstruction is impossible (even in the no-noise case) almost surely unless there are at least three channels. Conversely, when there are at least three channels, we show that perfect reconstruction is not only possible almost surely in the absence of noise, but also that it can be accomplished by finite impulse response (FIR) filtering. Such FIR reconstruction is vastly more efficient computationally than the least-squares solution, and is suitable for low noise levels. Even in the high-noise case, the estimates obtained by FIR filtering provide useful starting points for iterative least-squares algorithms. We present results on the minimum possible sizes of such deconvolver filters. We derive expressions for the mean-square errors in the FIR reconstructions, and show that performance comparable to that of the least-squares reconstruction may be obtained with relatively small deconvolver filters. Finally, we demonstrate the FIR reconstruction on synthetic and real data.","doi":"10.1109/83.766861","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/16615/00766861.pdf","startPage":"846","endPage":"862","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.766861","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exact image deconvolution from multiple FIR blurs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=766861","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/766861/","displayDocTitle":"Exact image deconvolution from multiple FIR blurs","volume":"8","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1999","accessionNumber":"6268820","pubMedId":"18267497","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exact image deconvolution from multiple FIR blurs","sourcePdf":"00766861.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040857S","chronDate":"June  1999","isNumber":"16615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"38","articleId":"766861","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":766862,"authors":[{"name":"MoonSeo Park","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, US"],"lastName":"MoonSeo Park","id":"37087219862"},{"name":"D.J.

The transimpedance gain-bandwidth product (Z/sub T//spl middot/BW) is 17 GHz/spl middot/k/spl Omega/, which is much higher than in previous published reports.","doi":"10.1109/16.766869","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.766869","startPage":"1094","endPage":"1098","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/16611/00766869.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16611","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved voltage gain of transimpedance amplifier by AlGaAs/InGaAs doped-channel FET's","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","displayDocTitle":"Improved voltage gain of transimpedance amplifier by AlGaAs/InGaAs doped-channel FET's","publicationDate":"June 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"46","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6267832","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/766869/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved voltage gain of transimpedance amplifier by AlGaAs/InGaAs doped-channel FET's","sourcePdf":"00766869.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048304S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"9","articleId":"766869","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":766878,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The deep traps are formulated as a g/r center based on the Shockley-Read-Hall model. Simulation results clarify the mechanism of the current anomaly: when deep traps are included in the depletion layer, they act as a carrier generation center and the junction current steeply increases. The magnitude of the current after saturation is discussed, focusing on capture rate and trap density. Further, experimental features for the anomaly, e.g., the fluctuation in the critical voltage at which the current begins to increase and the structure dependence of the anomalous current, are also discussed using the present deep trap model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/766878/","volume":"46","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"6272318","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Numerical analysis of an anomalous current assisted by locally generated deep traps in pn junctions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Numerical analysis of an anomalous current assisted by locally generated deep traps in pn junctions","sourcePdf":"00766878.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03491S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"14","articleId":"766878","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":766885,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Furthermore three transistors are merged into approximately one transistor area minimizing the cell size to almost one transistor area.

When plotted versus capacitance, the input equivalent noise current reaches its minimum value, for a given drain bias current, in a curve widely known and characterized as a shallow one. For high bit rate photocurrent amplifiers, which employ short-channel MOSFET's as the input device, the observed sensitivity degradation is due to the increased input referred noise attributed to the MOSFET's short-channel operation. It is shown here that for short-channel MOSFET's the electron warming in the channel, the voltage fluctuations due to the gate polysilicon resistance, and the induced thermal noise at the gate, lead to a considerably lower value for the optimum input capacitance. In this case, the noise power versus the capacitance curve becomes steeper and the minimum is more prominent.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/16611/00766894.pdf","startPage":"1253","endPage":"1257","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/16.766894","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.766894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16611","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=766894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Input capacitance scaling related to short-channel noise phenomena in MOSFET's","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MOSFETs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MOSFET","capacitance","semiconductor device noise","fluctuations","thermal noise","equivalent circuits","semiconductor device models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["input capacitance scaling","short-channel noise phenomena","input equivalent noise current","drain bias current","high bit rate photocurrent amplifiers","short-channel MOSFETs","sensitivity degradation","input referred noise","channel electron warming","voltage fluctuations","gate polysilicon resistance","induced thermal noise","noise power/capacitance curve"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/766894/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","displayDocTitle":"Input capacitance scaling related to short-channel noise phenomena in MOSFET's","volume":"46","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1999","accessionNumber":"6272334","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Input capacitance scaling related to short-channel noise phenomena in MOSFET's","sourcePdf":"00766894.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039005S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"8","articleId":"766894","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":766902,"authors":[{"name":"T.

We define a minimalistic, security dedicated program model that only contains procedure call and run time security checks and propose an automatic method for verifying that an implementation using local security checks satisfies a global security property.

Since many current IDSs are constructed by manual encoding of expert knowledge, changes to IDSs are expensive and slow. We describe a data mining framework for adaptively building Intrusion Detection (ID) models. The central idea is to utilize auditing programs to extract an extensive set of features that describe each network connection or host session, and apply data mining programs to learn rules that accurately capture the behavior of intrusions and normal activities. These rules can then be used for misuse detection and anomaly detection. New detection models are incorporated into an existing IDS through a meta-learning (or co-operative learning) process, which produces a meta detection model that combines evidence from multiple models. We discuss the strengths of our data mining programs, namely, classification, meta-learning, association rules, and frequent episodes. We report on the results of applying these programs to the extensively gathered network audit data for the 1998 DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation Program.","doi":"10.1109/SECPRI.1999.766909","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1999 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (Cat.

We study one such observable-sequences of system calls into the kernel of an operating system. Using system-call data sets generated by several different programs, we compare the ability of different data modeling methods to represent normal behavior accurately and to recognize intrusions. We compare the following methods: simple enumeration of observed sequences; comparison of relative frequencies of different sequences; a rule induction technique; and hidden Markov models (HMMs). We discuss the factors affecting the performance of each method and conclude that for this particular problem, weaker methods than HMMs are likely sufficient.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1999 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (Cat.

For more than a decade, earlier versions of P-BEST have been used in intrusion detection research and in the development of some of the most well known intrusion detection systems, but this is the first time the principles and language of P-BEST are described to a wide audience. We present rule sets for detecting subversion methods against which there are few defenses-specifically, SYN flooding and buffer overruns-and provide performance measurements. Together, these examples and performance measurements indicate that P-BEST based expert systems are well suited for real time misuse detection in contemporary computing environments. In addition, the simplicity of the P-BEST language and its close integration with the C programming language makes it easy to use while still being very powerful and flexible.","doi":"10.1109/SECPRI.1999.766911","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1999 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (Cat.

We show how the likelihood ratio may be recast into an estimator-correlator form that shows that an essential feature of the optimal detector is to compute an optimum estimate of the reciprocal of the unknown random local power level. We then proceed to show that the optimal detector may be recast into yet another form, namely a matched filter compared with a data-dependent threshold. With these reformulations of the optimal detector, the problem of obtaining suboptimal detectors may be systematically studied by either approximating the likelihood ratio directly, utilizing a suboptimal estimate in the estimator-correlator structure or utilizing a suboptimal function to model the data-dependent threshold in the matched filter interpretation. Each of these approaches is studied to obtain suboptimal detectors. The results indicate that for processing small numbers of pulses, a suboptimal detector that utilizes information about the nature of the non-Gaussian clutter can be implemented to obtain quasi-optimal performance. As the number of pulses to be processed increases, a suboptimal detector that does not require information about the specific nature of the non-Gaussian clutter may be implemented to obtain quasi-optimal performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/16623/00766928.pdf","startPage":"445","endPage":"458","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/7.766928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.766928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16623","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=766928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structures for radar detection in compound Gaussian clutter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar detection","Detectors","Statistics","Radar clutter","Object detection","Matched filters","Mathematical model","Gaussian distribution","Sensor systems and applications","Electromagnetic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar clutter","radar detection","Gaussian distribution","Gaussian noise","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood detection","adaptive signal detection","radar signal processing","covariance matrices","matched filters","correlation theory","maximum likelihood estimation","radar theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coherent radar target detection","compound Gaussian clutter","non-Gaussian clutter background","compound Gaussian distribution","likelihood ratio","estimator-correlator form","optimal detector","unknown random local power level reciprocal","matched filter","data-dependent threshold","suboptimal detectors","quasi-optimal performance","clutter model","covariance matrix","minimum mean square error","Gaussian noise","MAXLE"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/766928/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","displayDocTitle":"Structures for radar detection in compound Gaussian clutter","volume":"35","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6272371","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structures for radar detection in compound Gaussian clutter","sourcePdf":"00766928.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037986S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"112","articleId":"766928","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":766938,"authors":[{"name":"Faa-Jeng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Faa-Jeng Lin","id":"37086996997"},{"name":"Rong-Jong Wai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Rong-Jong Wai","id":"37085919478"},{"name":"Pao-Chuan Lin","affiliation":["Chung Yuan Christian University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Pao-Chuan Lin","id":"37087312247"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9251"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9603"},{"format":"CD","value":"2371-9877"}],"articleNumber":"766938","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":567},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Aerospace &amp;

To design signal processing algorithms that exploit the knowledge of clutter characteristics, a preliminary statistical analysis of ground-clutter data is necessary. We report the results of a statistical analysis of X-band ground-clutter data from the MIT Lincoln Laboratory Phase One program. Data non-Gaussianity of the in-phase and quadrature components was revealed, first by means of histogram and moments analysis, and then by means of a Gaussianity test based on cumulants of order higher than the second; to this purpose parametric autoregressive (AR) modeling of the clutter process was developed. The test is computationally attractive and has constant false alarm rate (CFAR). Incoherent analysis has also been carried out by checking the fitting to Rayleigh, Weibull, log-normal, and K-distribution models. Finally, a new modified Kolmogorov-Smirnoff (KS) goodness-of-fit test is proposed; this modified test guarantees good fitting in the distribution tails, which is of fundamental importance for a correct design of CFAR processors.","doi":"10.1109/7.766939","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/16623/00766939.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.766939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16623","startPage":"579","endPage":"593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical analyses of measured radar ground clutter data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=766939","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Statistical analyses of measured radar ground clutter data","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/766939/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6272382","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical analyses of measured radar ground clutter data","sourcePdf":"00766939.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063182S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"156","articleId":"766939","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":766943,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

The current loop is, indeed, particularly sensitive to any model mismatch and to the possibly incorrect identification of the model parameters. A detailed analysis of the stability limitations of the commonly adopted dead-beat algorithm, based on a discrete-time state-space model of the controlled system, is presented. A modified line voltage estimation technique is proposed, which increases the control's robustness to parameter mismatches. The results of the theoretical analysis and the validity of the proposed modification to the control strategy are finally verified both by simulations and by experimental tests.","doi":"10.1109/28.767012","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/16612/00767012.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.767012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16612","startPage":"613","endPage":"620","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust dead-beat current control for PWM rectifiers and active filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=767012","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust dead-beat current control for PWM rectifiers and active filters","chronOrPublicationDate":"May/Jun 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/767012/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May/Jun 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May-June 1999","accessionNumber":"6272467","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust dead-beat current control for PWM rectifiers and active filters","sourcePdf":"00767012.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034477S","chronDate":"May/Jun 1999","isNumber":"16612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"230","articleId":"767012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":767014,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The active filter acts as a low resistor to the external circuit for harmonic frequencies, and it is installed on the end bus of the power distribution line, just like a 50 /spl Omega/ terminator installed on the end terminal of a signal transmission line. Therefore, the function of the active filter is referred to as \"harmonic termination\" in this paper.

With the graft scheme, the active switches which are with a common node and operating in unison can be integrated to form a single stage converter (SSC). The small-signal models of the SSC can, therefore, be derived by combining those of its originally separate converters. Using the proposed approach can help yield highly related dynamic models of the converters in a family and, in addition, physical insights between the converters can be readily identified. Moreover, the expressions of the small-signal models for the SSCs operated in DCM can be extended to those in continuous-conduction-mode operation. These have made the proposed modeling method valuable and viable. Experimental measurements have demonstrated that the small-signal model of an SSC derived with the proposed approach is relatively accurate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/767066/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1999","accessionNumber":"6277332","volume":"46","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of single-stage converters with high power factor and fast regulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of single-stage converters with high power factor and fast regulation","sourcePdf":"00767066.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04323S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"16","articleId":"767066","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":767067,"authors":[{"name":"J.F.

The method is demonstrated by considering the performance of a boost-type active power-factor corrector (APFC) that does not need to sense the input voltage.

This method improves upon prior work in several ways: automatic adaptation from frame to frame without manual initialization/adjustment, with few tunable parameters; robust operation on image sequences exhibiting natural variability, poor and varying imaging conditions, including over/under-exposure, low contrast, and artifacts such as glare; does not require the vasculature to be connected, so it can handle partial views; and operation is efficient enough for use on unspecialized hardware, and amenable to deadline-driven computing, being able to produce a rapidly and monotonically improving sequence of usable partial results. Increased computation can be traded for superior tracing performance. Its efficiency comes from direct processing on gray-level data without any preprocessing, and from processing only a minimally necessary fraction of pixels in an exploratory manner, avoiding low-level image-wide operations such as thresholding, edge detection, and morphological processing. These properties make the algorithm suited to real-time, on-line (live) processing and is being applied to computer-assisted laser retinal surgery.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/16626/00767088.pdf","startPage":"125","endPage":"138","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","doi":"10.1109/4233.767088","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4233.767088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16626","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=767088","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rapid automated tracing and feature extraction from retinal fundus images using direct exploratory algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Retina","Robustness","Algorithm design and analysis","Manuals","Tunable circuits and devices","Image sequences","Hardware","Pixel","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical image processing","feature extraction","image sequences","eye","real-time systems","surgery","blood vessels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rapid automated tracing","feature extraction","retinal fundus images","retinal vasculature","image sequences","low contrast","glare","deadline-driven computing","performance","gray-level data","pixels","real-time online processing","computer-assisted laser retinal surgery","medical image processing"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Angiography","Automation","Retinal Vessels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/767088/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1999","displayDocTitle":"Rapid automated tracing and feature extraction from retinal fundus images using direct exploratory algorithms","volume":"3","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1999","accessionNumber":"6278547","pubMedId":"10719494","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rapid automated tracing and feature extraction from retinal fundus images using direct exploratory algorithms","sourcePdf":"00767088.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070301S","chronDate":"June  1999","isNumber":"16626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"315","articleId":"767088","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":767093,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The method involves a fast, reliable, and effective algorithm that exploits the spatial distribution characteristics of human skin color. A universal skin-color map is derived and used on the chrominance component of the input image to detect pixels with skin-color appearance. Then, based on the spatial distribution of the detected skin-color pixels and their corresponding luminance values, the algorithm employs a set of novel regularization processes to reinforce regions of skin-color pixels that are more likely to belong to the facial regions and eliminate those that are not. The performance of the face-segmentation algorithm is illustrated by some simulation results carried out on various head-and-shoulders test images. The use of face segmentation for video coding in applications such as videotelephony is then presented. We explain how the face-segmentation results can be used to improve the perceptual quality of a videophone sequence encoded by the H.261-compliant coder.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/767122/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6280597","volume":"9","issue":"4","publicationDate":"June 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Face segmentation using skin-color map in videophone applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face segmentation using skin-color map in videophone applications","sourcePdf":"00767122.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037387S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"468","articleId":"767122","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":767126,"authors":[{"name":"I-Ming Pao","affiliation":["Information Processing Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"lastName":"I-Ming Pao","id":"37369782600"},{"name":"Ming-Ting Sun","affiliation":["Information Processing Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Ming-Ting Sun","id":"37278328800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"767126","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":133,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":633},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Encoding","Quantization","Motion estimation","Sun","Degradation","PSNR","Video coding","Adaptive algorithm","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding","transform coding","discrete cosine transforms","inverse problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DCT coefficients","fast video encoding","multimedia applications","discrete cosine transform","inverse DCT","IDCT","adaptive algorithm","inverse quantization","quantization step size","video-quality"]}],"abstract":"Digital video coding standards such as H.263 and MPEG are becoming more and more important for multimedia applications. Due to the huge amount of computations required, there are significant efforts to speed up the processing of video encoders. Previously, the efforts were mainly focused on the fast motion-estimation algorithm. However, as the motion-estimation algorithm becomes optimized, to speed up the video encoders further we also need to optimize other functions such as the discrete cosine transform (DCT) and inverse DCT (IDCT). In this paper, we propose a theoretical model for DCT coefficients. Based on the model, we develop an adaptive algorithm to reduce the computations of DCT, IDCT, quantization, and inverse quantization. We also present a fast DCT algorithm to speed up the calculations of DCT further when the quantization step size is large. We show, by simulations, that significant improvement in the processing speed can be achieved with negligible video-quality degradation, We also implement the algorithm in a real-time PC-based platform to show that it is effective and practical.","doi":"10.1109/76.767126","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/16628/00767126.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.767126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16628","startPage":"608","endPage":"616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling DCT coefficients for fast video encoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=767126","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling DCT coefficients for fast video encoding","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/767126/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"4","publicationDate":"June 1999","accessionNumber":"6280601","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling DCT coefficients for fast video encoding","sourcePdf":"00767126.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04034S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"133","articleId":"767126","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":767144,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The INBCs are boundary conditions of the third kind which couple the electric and magnetic field tangential components on the shield surfaces. The application of the INBCs in time domain leads to the solution of convolution integrals.

Special techniques to consider the geometrical structure of skewed rotor bars are described. With the proposed method, a change in the topology of the meshes at different rotor positions needs minor modifications only. The 3-D mesh for the rotor can thus be rotated with minimal extra computing time. Here the 2-D multi-slice mesh is used as the base-planes for extruding the 3-D mesh and the results of the 2-D multi-slice model can thus be used in the 3-D model. The techniques reported in this paper greatly simplifies the 3-D mesh generation, resulting in a considerable reduction in the computing time of the associated 3-D time stepping model. The generated meshes have been used successfully in constructing the 3-D time stepping finite element model for studying the electromagnetic field of induction motors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/767181/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","volume":"35","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6279053","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Generation and rotation of 3-D finite element mesh for skewed rotor induction motors using extrusion technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generation and rotation of 3-D finite element mesh for skewed rotor induction motors using extrusion technique","sourcePdf":"00767181.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029749S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"9","articleId":"767181","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":767184,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Moreover, an expanded curvilinear mesh algorithm for the interior of the PML is introduced in order to achieve the required reflection with a reduced number of cells.

In many cases, an adequate mapping transforms the problem into an easier one or allows advantage to be taken of the symmetries. This paper demonstrates that any mapping can be handled automatically provided the classical vector analysis approach is given up for the benefit of a differential geometry approach. As a first example, it is shown that axisymmetrical problems need no more a particular treatment provided the mapping of the cylindrical coordinates on the cartesian ones is considered as it is. Furthermore, a novel axisymmetrical formulation is proposed which relies on one further transformation and improves considerably the quality of the interpolated field. Transformation methods are also of great help to model the infinite space by means of finite elements. Many authors have presented such transformations which are often instances of the same general shell transformation that is presented here.","doi":"10.1109/20.767235","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","startPage":"1434","endPage":"1437","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/16624/00767235.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.767235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16624","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite element modelling with transformation techniques","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Object oriented modeling","Geometry","Interpolation","Object oriented programming","Shape","Gaussian processes","Failure analysis","Jacobian matrices","Bridges"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","differential geometry","transforms","electromagnetic fields"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TEAM Workshop problem 11","object oriented programming","software design/development","Interpolation","finite element modelling","transformation techniques","mapping","classical vector analysis approach","differential geometry approach","axisymmetrical problems","cylindrical coordinates","cartesian coordinates","axisymmetrical formulation","infinite space modelling","shell transformation","electromagnetism","induction field"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","displayDocTitle":"Finite element modelling with transformation techniques","volume":"35","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6279096","publicationDate":"May 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/767235/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite element modelling with transformation techniques","sourcePdf":"00767235.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030644S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"29","articleId":"767235","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":767236,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Fast backprojection retains the advantages of standard backprojection: perfect motion compensation for any flight path, low artifact levels, unlimited scene size, perfect focus for arbitrarily wide bandwidths and integration angles, and strictly local processing (i.e., pulses can be processed as they are collected without along-track buffering or corner turns). The new algorithm also makes it possible to store the image in progress on disk (rather than in memory) with only a mild penalty in processing speed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast backprojection algorithm for synthetic aperture radar","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1999 IEEE Radar Conference.

Numerical results show that the IISTs based on the HGLMA and the GA can all reconstruct the permittivity of the high-contrast and large object, in contrast the IIST based on the LMA can't reconstruct the desired permittivity due to trapping in local minima of the cost function. Numerical results also show that the quality of the permittivity reconstructed by the HGLMA is better than that of the permittivity by GA and the convergence of HGLMA is faster than that of GA. When the noise is present, the characteristics of the cost function show that multiple incident waves are needed for the stable inversion.","doi":"10.1109/20.767278","startPage":"1582","endPage":"1585","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.767278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16624","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/16624/00767278.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction of a high contrast and large object by using the hybrid algorithm combining a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and a genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/767278/","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction of a high contrast and large object by using the hybrid algorithm combining a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and a genetic algorithm","volume":"35","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6279133","publicationDate":"May 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction of a high contrast and large object by using the hybrid algorithm combining a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and a genetic algorithm","sourcePdf":"00767278.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032161S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"16","articleId":"767278","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":767285,"authors":[{"name":"W.

We present an exact expression for the normalized SINR as a function of random variables with known distributions and then, using a Taylor series expansion, we present approximate expressions for the mean and variance of the normalized SINR. We note that under the assumption of uncorrelated inputs and known correlation matrices that the dual channel matched filter system is equivalent to a single channel matched filter designed to process both input signals. Further, we show that when estimated correlation matrices are used in place of the true correlation matrices the dual channel matched filter system achieves nearly the same normalized SINR performance as the single channel matched filter system with half the secondary data. These results suggest that, with the proper preprocessing to decorrelate the input signal, a single channel matched filter system can be replaced by a dual channel matched filter system of smaller size, leading to a reduction in computational cost and secondary data requirements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/767349/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","conferenceDate":"22-22 April 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6439293","displayDocTitle":"Dual channel matched filter system-a performance analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual channel matched filter system-a performance analysis","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00767349.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031202S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"16591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6212","citationCount":"1","articleId":"767349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":767355,"authors":[{"name":"C.A.

The gate turn-off thyristor (GTO) is suited for this task. This requires series connection of several devices and their support systems (electronic and thermal). Reliable operation depends on devising a control algorithm that will cause the individual GTO's to conduct and recover simultaneously. Computer simulation shows that a window of 100 ns is required, during which time all devices must alter from on to off state, and vice versa, to prevent overvoltages on any device of the chain. A first milestone is the construction and testing of a 5 kV series GTO based switch at modest current densities. Operation of the 5 kV series stack will be compared to the computer simulation, showing excellent agreement.

The design cycle is speeded up using VHDL based synthesis and parametrizable models. To achieve a short implementation time, the filters are prototyped using Field Programmable Cate Arrays (FPGAs) from Xilinx Inc. The main emphasis is on finding out the efficient ways of describing nonlinear filter structures on VHDL, and mapping to the dedicated FPGA architecture. The performance and logic capacity studies are used to find out reasonable algorithms and applications to be implemented with FPGAs.","doi":"10.1109/NDSP.1993.767728","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00767728.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Winter Workshop on Nonlinear Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Winter Workshop on Nonlinear Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6208/16581/00767728.pdf","startPage":"5.2_4.1","endPage":"5.2_4.6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16581","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NDSP.1993.767728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast implementation of stack filters with vhdl-based synthesis and fpgas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/767728/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","displayDocTitle":"Fast implementation of stack filters with vhdl-based synthesis and fpgas","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"17-20 Jan. 1993","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast implementation of stack filters with vhdl-based synthesis and fpgas","confLoc":"Tampere, Finland","sourcePdf":"00767728.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050323S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"16581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6208","citationCount":"8","articleId":"767728","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":767748,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The second method is an iterative technique using the non-lincar system, we get faster convergence than a simple successive approximation. These methods and analyses are extendable to n-dimensional signals. The feasibility of this procedure is demonstrated through examples of random signals, speech and color image restoration when some of the pixels are lost.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal analysis","Color","Phase modulation","Low pass filters","Filtering","Image reconstruction","Image sampling","Radio astronomy","Fading","Two dimensional displays"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NDSP.1993.767748","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00767748.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Winter Workshop on Nonlinear Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Winter Workshop on Nonlinear Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6208/16581/00767748.pdf","startPage":"6.3_3.1","endPage":"6.3_3.6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16581","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NDSP.1993.767748","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative nonlinear technique for recovery of signals from irregular samples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=767748","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Iterative nonlinear technique for recovery of signals from irregular samples","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/767748/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"17-20 Jan. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative nonlinear technique for recovery of signals from irregular samples","confLoc":"Tampere, Finland","sourcePdf":"00767748.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029663S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"16581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6208","articleId":"767748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":767756,"authors":[{"name":"Xudong Song","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"lastName":"Xudong Song","id":"37383095800"},{"name":"T.

The mean square error and mean absolute error are compared for each method using a number of real-world test images. It is shown that in the image compression task using 8 x 8 image blocks, the 5-layer MLP can do better than the 3-layer MLP and PCA when the data is the same as used for training the networks, but its generalization ability is poor when the data is new.

It has been reported that, in the reverse link, such systems, in comparison to conventional single-antenna systems, have the potential to achieve a capacity increase which is equal to the number of antenna elements used. In order to achieve this gain, the interference picked up by different antenna elements must be uncorrelated. We present a spatial correlated interference analysis for the simplest non-trivial system which has 2 antenna elements and 2 users. The effects of system parameters and user and antenna element locations on the correlated interference are investigated. This work lays down a foundational framework that may yield a comprehensive understanding of the performance of CDMA multi-antenna systems.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1999.767869","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Communications (Cat.

Two ways to approximate the averaging over the interfering data symbol combinations are considered and compared. One is a semi-analytic method, where only part of the interfering data symbol combinations are taken into consideration in the averaging. The other is the Gaussian approximation.

In the absence of error propagation, a two-stage structure achieves the single-user bound for all users, and is shown to be equivalent to an MMSE DFD with parallel feedback.

Unlike the conventional MIC, which tries to subtract the lump sum of the multiple access interference (MAI) and the self-interference (SI), the MIC-RAKE attempts to cancel the MAI and the partial SI, and to treat the residual SI as useful signal for symbol decision. The RAKE combining is employed to collect signal replicas over multiple fading paths. The upper and lower bounds on the bit error probability are derived by using a Gaussian approximation.

However, to date, only limited attention has been given to the performance of turbo codes on fading channels, and the influence of multipath fading has been fairly accurately investigated as far as the Rayleigh fading distribution is concerned only. Therefore, it is the purpose of this work to conduct a study of turbo codes performance considering the more general Rice fading case: the study is performed in conjunction with both the fully-interleaved channel and the correlated Rice slow-fading channel.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1999.767899","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Communications (Cat.

While ATM provides increased flexibility in supporting various types of traffic the traffic control problems become more difficult to solve when trying to achieve efficient use of network resources. One of such problem is the bandwidth allocation. This paper presents a new approach to the bandwidth allocation problem for video traffic using radial basis functions neural networks (RBFNN). Estimation of an accurate amount of bandwidth to support this traffic has been a challenging task using conventional algorithmic approaches. In this paper, we show that a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is capable of learning the non-linear multi-dimentional mapping between different multimedia traffic patterns quality of service (QoS) requirements and the required bandwidth to support each call. Our method employs \"on-line\" measurements of the traffic count process over a monitoring period which is determined such that the error in estimating the bandwidth is minimized to less than 3% of the actual value. In order to simplify the design of the RBFNN, the input traffic is preprocessed through a low pass filter in order to smooth all high frequency fluctuations. A large set of training data, representing different traffic patterns with different QoS requirements, was used to ensure that RBFNN can generalize and produce accurate results when confronted with new data. The reported results prove that the neurocomputing approach is effective in achieving more accurate results than other traditional methods, based upon mathematical or simulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/767912/","accessionNumber":"6459720","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"6-10 June 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Bandwidth allocation of variable bit rate video in ATM networks using radial basis function neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bandwidth allocation of variable bit rate video in ATM networks using radial basis function neural networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00767912.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041622S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"16572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6202","articleId":"767912","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":767913,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Using OFDM in a 60 GHz transmission system is an extremely crucial issue, since frequency deviations of only one ppm of the oscillators are within the range of the subcarrier spacing. In order to achieve a fast and robust frequency correction the insertion of a fractionally spaced training sequence in the frequency domain, with RLS-adaption to that sequence at the receiver, and final FIR-equalization is proposed. Proper work of the FIR equalization is ensured by using root-raised-cosine shaping at the transmitter in the time domain, thereby limiting inter channel interference. The proposed modulation and frequency correction scheme has been implemented on a digital signal processor array using 512-DQPSK-OFDM. Bit error rate measurements have been carried out with a 60 GHz indoor transmission system. Within that system the OFDM signal was supplied to the transmitter via a fibre optic link at the first IF stage. Measurements confirm the simulations to a high extent showing only about 2 dB loss compared to simulation results in the AWGN channel. Burst data rates of /spl ap/45 Mbit/s have been achieved using a 35 MHz bandwidth, an omnidirectional antenna at the transmitter, and a directed antenna at the receiver.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast frequency correction for DQPSK-OFDM in the 60 GHz indoor environment","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Communications (Cat.

We consider an OFDM system that achieves one hundred percent efficiency of bandwidth usage and uses sufficient statistic. A one-tap decision feedback equalizer (DFE) is proposed.

COFDM has been chosen over more traditional single carrier adaptive equalization modulation techniques due to its better bandwidth efficiency and to its increased robustness to multipath fading and to interference. The radio is designed to operate in a burst mode, asynchronously exchanging radio frequency (RF) packets with other nodes in a wireless network. The data rate in each burst is optimized to provide the maximum data rate supported by the channel conditions. Four data rates are presently supported within a 600 kHz channelization; 1536 kbps, 768 kbps, 384 kbps, and 64 kbps. In addition, the radio may be operated in a synchronous continuous mode for broadcast or point-to-point applications.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1999.767920","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Communications (Cat.

With this method all VDSL-modems on different wires in the same bindergroup have to be time-synchronized to avoid near-end cross-talk (NEXT). We describe a method which enables Zipper to run in a time-asynchronous mode. By introducing pulse-shaping in the transmitter and windowing in the receiver the NEXT is almost completely suppressed even though the synchronization between modems on neighboring lines is skipped. The remaining NEXT and efficiency loss due to pulse-shaping and windowing results in only a small bit-rate performance loss, typically less than 10% compared to the time-synchronized Zipper. However, with the new freedom of optimizing the lengths of the cyclic suffices with asynchronous Zipper, there may even be a small improvement in bit-rate performance for short wires.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1999.767928","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Communications (Cat.

Wireless losses make TCP unnecessarily initiate its congestion control mechanism which results in poor performance in the form of low throughput and high interactive delay. We investigate, through computer simulations, the end-to-end effects of link-layer retransmissions on TCP Reno over a low-data-rate wireless link. Our results show that, by using the more effective selective-reject ARQ at the link layer, the problem of competitive retransmissions between TCP and link layer is much less serious than previously reported. We show that a non-sequencing link layer in combination with fragmentations of datagrams at the base stations and mobile hosts can be employed without significantly degrading TCP performance.

Space-time codes are channel codes designed to exploit this high capacity for multiple-antenna systems without requiring instantaneous channel knowledge at the transmitter. A practical concern for high data rate space-time codes is their decoding complexity. The decoding complexity with ML criterion can be prohibitively large. In this paper, we focus on layered space-time (LST) codes. Two types of LST codes, the horizontally-layered space-time (HLST) codes and the diagonally-layered space-time (DLST) codes, are presented. We analyze the performance of both types of LST codes under slow and fast fading conditions. We conclude that, in a slow fading environment, DLST codes have superior performance over HLST codes. The design criteria for DLST codes are proposed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Layered space-time codes for wireless communications using multiple transmit antennas","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Communications (Cat.

The paper introduces a method to analyze network throughput with variable packet durations due to variable user data rate. The large improvement from the adaptive system compared to the conventional fixed rate counterpart is demonstrated by various mobile user population profiles and radio propagation path loss models.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Communications (Cat.

An adaptive power control algorithm is exploited to achieve the desired signal to noise and interference ratio (SINR) at each subchannel and increase the power efficiency of the mobile transmitter. Therefore, we can achieve a better overall error probability with a fixed total power. A distributed iterative algorithm is used to jointly update the transmission power and the beamformer weights at each subchannel so that it can converge to the optimal solution for both power and beamforming vectors at each subchannel. Another algorithm has been proposed to decrease the complexity resulting from the number of beamformers and FFT blocks. The algorithms use only the interference measured locally by the transmitter. Unlike most of the loading algorithms which optimize the bit distribution and subchannel power allocation for a single transmitter, this approach tries to optimize the power allocation and decrease the interference for the whole network.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1999.767994","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Communications (Cat.

In this paper, we compare the performance of delay, permutation and space-time coding transmitter diversity for OFDM systems, and its impact on high-rate packet data wireless networks, where relatively high block error rates, such as, 10%, on the wireless links are acceptable using ARQ. As an alternative, we also consider using the same number of transmitter antennas for down-link beamforming in the direction of the desired mobiles. Our investigation indicates that the delay transmitter diversity with QPSK modulation and adaptive antenna arrays can provide good quality of service (QoS) with a low retransmission probability while space-time coding transmitter diversity can provide high peak-rate. However, down-link beamforming together with adaptive antenna arrays, if it is applicable, appears to be a better alternative to transmitter diversity.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Communications (Cat.

Standard minimum mean squared error (MMSE) receivers have various problems in tracking the rapidly changing channel characteristics in fading environments. In addition, they require a training sequence for their adaptation. This paper presents a constrained MMSE receiver with a modified MMSE criterion. The constrained MMSE receiver is adaptively implemented using the orthogonal decomposition-based least mean square (LMS) algorithm. In order to improve the accuracy of the reference signal and channel estimates, a pilot symbol-aided scheme is employed. It also makes the proposed MMSE receiver not require any separate training sequence. The simulation results show that the proposed MMSE receiver provides significant performance improvements in bit error rate (BER) over the conventional matched filter (MF) receiver and the currently available MMSE receivers, and is insensitive to the speed of Rayleigh fading.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1999.768000","pdfPath":"/iel5/6202/16572/00768000.pdf","startPage":"555","endPage":"558 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Communications (Cat.

In general, wireless channels are time-frequency dispersive. The performance of wireless OFDM therefore depends critically on the time-frequency localization of the pulse shaping filter used. It has been pointed out in Haas (1996) that OFDM systems based on offset QAM (OFDM/OQAM) bypass a major disadvantage of OFDM schemes based on ordinary QAM, namely the fact that well-localized pulse shaping filters are prohibited in the case of a critical time-frequency grid where spectral efficiency is maximal. In this paper, we derive general orthogonality conditions for OFDM/OQAM systems and we propose efficient (FFT-based) design procedures for time-frequency well-localized OFDM/OQAM pulse shaping filters with arbitrary length and arbitrary overlapping factors.

It generalizes and extends the concept of a virtual coupling network, an artificial link between the haptic display and a virtual world, to include both the impedance and admittance models of haptic interaction. A benchmark example exposes an important duality between these two cases. Linear circuit theory is used to develop necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of a haptic simulation, assuming the human operator and virtual environment are passive. These equations lead to an explicit design procedure for virtual coupling networks which give maximum performance while guaranteeing stability.

Specifically, the paper addresses deadlock avoidance for single capacity systems (each machine has a single unit of buffer capacity), and mixed capacity systems (some machines have multiple units of buffer capacity). For each of these, we characterize deadlock and prove the correctness of several methods of suboptimal deadlock avoidance. We also address two interesting special cases. The first assumes that every stage of every part type can be performed on at least one multiple capacity machine, whereas the second provides a finite central buffer that can be revisited after every processing stage. For the first case, we present two suboptimal deadlock avoidance approaches, while for the second case, we show optimal deadlock avoidance to be computationally tractable.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/70/16638/00768182.pdf","startPage":"497","endPage":"509","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/70.768182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.768182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16638","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=768182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deadlock avoidance for production systems with flexible routing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System recovery","Production systems","Routing","Resource management","Manufacturing systems","Control systems","Discrete event systems","Supervisory control","Flexible manufacturing systems","Industrial engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible manufacturing systems","production control","discrete event systems","suboptimal control","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["production systems","flexible routing","deadlock avoidance","single capacity systems","mixed capacity systems","suboptimal control","buffer","production control","discrete event systems","flexible manufacturing systems","resource allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/768182/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","displayDocTitle":"Deadlock avoidance for production systems with flexible routing","volume":"15","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1999","accessionNumber":"6280225","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deadlock avoidance for production systems with flexible routing","sourcePdf":"00768182.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043192S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"94","articleId":"768182","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":768184,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Ma","affiliation":["Electronics Research Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Yi Ma","id":"37274225400"},{"name":"J.

Furthermore, the problem of estimation from the vision measurements has been considered separately from the design of the control strategies. Instead of addressing the pose estimation and control problems separately, we attempt to characterize the types of control tasks which can be achieved using only quantities directly measurable in the image, bypassing the pose estimation phase. We consider the task of navigation for a nonholonomic ground mobile base tracking an arbitrarily shaped continuous ground curve. This tracking problem is formulated as one of controlling the shape of the curve in the image plane. We study the controllability of the system characterizing the dynamics of the image curve, and show that the shape of the image curve is controllable only up to its \"linear\" curvature parameters. We present stabilizing control laws for tracking piecewise analytic curves, and propose to track arbitrary curves by approximating them by piecewise \"linear\" curvature curves. Simulation results are given for these control schemes. Observability of the curve dynamics by using direct measurements from vision sensors as the outputs is studied and an extended Kalman filter is proposed to dynamically estimate the image quantities needed for feedback control from the actual noisy images.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/768184/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","volume":"15","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1999","accessionNumber":"6280227","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Vision guided navigation for a nonholonomic mobile robot","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vision guided navigation for a nonholonomic mobile robot","sourcePdf":"00768184.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066702S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"141","articleId":"768184","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":768190,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Min Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong-Min Yang","id":"37350849700"},{"name":"Jong-Hwan Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong-Hwan Kim","id":"37337245700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1042-296X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-958X"}],"articleNumber":"768190","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":428,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5011},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=768190","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sliding mode control","Trajectory","Mobile robots","Robust control","Automatic control","Control systems","Robustness","Robot control","Uncertainty","Navigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","tracking","variable structure systems","robust control","feedback","linearisation techniques","asymptotic stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sliding mode control","trajectory tracking","nonholonomic wheeled mobile robots","time derivatives","position control","robust tracking control","polar coordinates","dynamic equation","feedback-linearization","computed-torque method","asymptotic stability","bounded external disturbances"]}],"abstract":"Nonholonomic mobile robots have constraints imposed on the motion that are not integrable, i.e., the constraints cannot be written as time derivatives of some function of the generalized coordinates.

The posture of a mobile robot is represented by polar coordinates and the dynamic equation of the robot is feedback-linearized by the computed-torque method. A novel sliding mode control law is proposed for asymptotically stabilizing the mobile robot to a desired trajectory. It is shown that the proposed scheme is robust to bounded external disturbances.

In particular we consider a scenario consisting of packet based transmission with automatic repeat request (ARQ) error control and a back channel. We start by showing how the delay constraints in real time video transmission can be translated into rate constraints at the encoder, where the applicable rate constraints at a given time depend on future channel rates. With the acknowledgments received through the back channel we have an estimate of the current channel state. This information, combined with an a priori model of the channel, allows us to statistically model the future channel rates. Thus the rate constraints at the encoder can be expressed in terms of the expected channel behavior. We can then formalize a rate distortion optimization problem, namely, that of assigning quantizers to each of the video blocks stored in the encoder buffer such that the quality of the received video is maximized. This requires that the rate constraints be included in the optimization, since violating a rate constraint is equivalent to violating a delay constraint and thus results in losing a video block. We formalize two possible approaches. The first one seeks to minimize the distortion for the expected rate constraints given the channel model and current observation. The second approach seeks to allocate bits so as to minimize the expected distortion for the given model. We use both dynamic programming and Lagrangian optimization approaches to solve these problems. Our simulation results demonstrate that both the video distortion at the decoder and packet loss rate can be significantly reduced when incorporating the channel information provided by the feedback channel and the a priori model into the rate control algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate control for robust video transmission over burst-error wireless channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.768193","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/16637/00768193.pdf","startPage":"756","endPage":"773","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.768193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16637","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=768193","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/768193/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","displayDocTitle":"Rate control for robust video transmission over burst-error wireless channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6277914","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate control for robust video transmission over burst-error wireless channels","sourcePdf":"00768193.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0971S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"132","articleId":"768193","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":768194,"authors":[{"name":"M.B.

Some of the intended recipients may be more capable than others in the sense that their communication links from the transmitter have less interference, fading, or attenuation. Because it is desirable that a multicast or broadcast transmission be received successfully by all radios for which it is intended, the usual approach is to limit the transmission rate to that which can be demodulated by the least capable among these radios. Nonuniform nonbinary phase-shift-key (PSK) signal constellations can be designed to increase the throughput of multicast transmissions by delivering additional information to more-capable receivers along with the multicast message. This additional throughput can be employed to transmit multimedia messages (e.g., voice and data) to the more-capable receivers. In this paper, we determine the error probabilities for coherent demodulation of nonuniform PSK signals and noncoherent demodulation of nonuniform differential PSK signals. Because the PSK constellations have a constant envelope, they are better for use in mobile wireless communication networks than the constellations based on quadrature-amplitude modulation that have been proposed in previous publications.","doi":"10.1109/49.768194","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/16637/00768194.pdf","startPage":"774","endPage":"783","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.768194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonuniform phase-shift-key modulation for multimedia multicast transmission in mobile wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=768194","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/768194/","displayDocTitle":"Nonuniform phase-shift-key modulation for multimedia multicast transmission in mobile wireless networks","volume":"17","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6277915","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonuniform phase-shift-key modulation for multimedia multicast transmission in mobile wireless networks","sourcePdf":"00768194.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066288S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"80","articleId":"768194","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":768196,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Current radios are limited in their ability to adapt to these channel variations because they are designed with fixed values for most system parameters such as frame length, error control, and processing gain. The values for these parameters are usually a compromise between the requirements for worst-case channel conditions and the need for low implementation cost. Therefore, in benign channel conditions these commercial radios can consume more battery energy than needed to maintain a desired link quality, while in a severely degraded channel they can consume energy without providing any quality-of-service (QoS). While techniques for adapting radio parameters to channel variations have been studied to improve link performance, in this paper they are applied to minimize battery energy. Specifically, an adaptive radio is being designed that adapts the frame length, error control, processing gain, and equalization to different channel conditions, while minimizing battery energy consumption. Experimental measurements and simulation results are presented to illustrate the adaptive radio's energy savings.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"793","endPage":"813","doi":"10.1109/49.768196","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.768196","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/16637/00768196.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive radio for multimedia wireless links","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/768196/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive radio for multimedia wireless links","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6277917","volume":"17","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive radio for multimedia wireless links","sourcePdf":"00768196.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054835S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"70","articleId":"768196","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":768197,"authors":[{"name":"I.P.

While radio resource management algorithms (such as power control and call admission control) can provide certain levels of variability in QoS, an alternate approach is to use reconfigurable radio architectures to provide diverse QoS guarantees. We outline a novel reconfigurable architecture for linear multiuser detection, thereby providing a wide range of bit error rate (BER) requirements amongst the constituent receivers of the reconfigurable architecture. Specifically, we focus on achieving this dynamic reconfiguration via a software radio implementation of linear multiuser receivers. Using a unified framework for achieving this reconfiguration, we partition functionality into two core technologies [field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) and digital signal processor (DSP) devices] based on processing speed requirements. We present experimental results on the performance and reconfigurability of the software radio architecture as well as the impact of fixed point arithmetic (due to hardware constraints).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A software radio architecture for linear multiuser detection","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.768197","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/16637/00768197.pdf","startPage":"814","endPage":"823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.768197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16637","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=768197","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/768197/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","displayDocTitle":"A software radio architecture for linear multiuser detection","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6277918","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A software radio architecture for linear multiuser detection","sourcePdf":"00768197.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040488S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"23","articleId":"768197","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-11"},{"_id":768198,"authors":[{"name":"M.Z.

To achieve this ambitious goal, two of the major challenges in the system design are: (i) to provide a high-speed wireless subsystem with large capacity and acceptable quality-of-service (QoS) and (ii) to design a network architecture capable of supporting multimedia traffic and various kinds of user mobility. A time-hopping spread-spectrum wireless communication system called ultra-wide bandwidth (UWB) radio is used to provide communications that are low power, high data rate, fade resistant, and relatively shadow free in a dense multipath environment. Receiver-signal processing of UWB radio is described, and performance of such communications systems, in terms of multiple-access capability, is estimated under ideal multiple-access channel conditions. A UWB-signal propagation experiment is performed using the bandwidth in excess of 1 GHz in a typical modern office building in order to characterize the UWB-signal propagation channel. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the UWB radio and its robustness in a dense multipath environment. A ATM network is used as the backbone network due to its high bandwidth, fast switching capability, flexibility, and well-developed infrastructure. To minimize the impact caused by user mobility on the system performance, a hierarchical network-control architecture is postulated. A wireless virtual circuit (WVC) concept is proposed to improve the transmission efficiency and simplify the network control in the wireless subsystem. The key advantage of this network architecture and WVC concept is that the handoff can be done locally most of the time, due to the localized behavior of PCS users.","doi":"10.1109/49.768198","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/16637/00768198.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.768198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16637","startPage":"824","endPage":"836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ATM-based TH-SSMA network for multimedia PCS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=768198","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ATM-based TH-SSMA network for multimedia PCS","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/768198/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6277919","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ATM-based TH-SSMA network for multimedia PCS","sourcePdf":"00768198.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086196S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"41","articleId":"768198","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":768199,"authors":[{"name":"M.-S.

The proposed scheme takes advantage of the time-varying nature of fading to dynamically allocate the transmitted power between the inphase (I) and quadrature (Q) channels. It uses fixed-rate binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation on the Q channel for voice, and variable-rate M-ary amplitude modulation (M-AM) on the I channel for data. For favorable channel conditions, most of the power is allocated to high rate data transmission on the I channel. The remaining power is used to support the variable-power voice transmission on the Q channel. As the channel degrades, the modulation gradually reduces its data throughput and reallocates most of its available power to ensure a continuous and satisfactory voice transmission. The scheme is intended to provide a high average spectral efficiency for data communications while meeting the stringent delay requirements imposed by voice. We present closed-form expressions as well as numerical and simulation results for the outage probability, average allocated power, achievable spectral efficiency, and average bit error rate (BER) for both voice and data transmission over Nakagami-m fading channels. We also discuss the features and advantages of the proposed scheme. For example, in Rayleigh fading with an average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 20 dB, our scheme is able to transmit about 2 bits/s/Hz of data at an average BER of 10/sup -5/ while sending about 1 bit/s/Hz of voice at an average BER of 10/sup -2/.","doi":"10.1109/49.768199","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/16637/00768199.pdf","startPage":"837","endPage":"850","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.768199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive modulation scheme for simultaneous voice and data transmission over fading channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive modulation scheme for simultaneous voice and data transmission over fading channels","volume":"17","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6290210","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/768199/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive modulation scheme for simultaneous voice and data transmission over fading channels","sourcePdf":"00768199.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027401S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"81","articleId":"768199","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":768200,"authors":[{"name":"G.G.

Whereas the conventional view is that multipath-signal propagation is an impediment to reliable communication, this paper shows that multipath can actually multiply the achievable data rate for wireless channels provided that the appropriate communication structure is employed. Multivariate discrete multitone (MDMT) combined with multivariate trellis-coded modulation (MTCM) is proposed and analyzed as a practical means of realizing a multiplicative-rate advantage in the case where channel-state information is not available at the transmitter. In Rayleigh fading, these new techniques are shown to simultaneously achieve a multiplicative data-rate advantage and lower error rate as compared to conventional coded orthogonal-frequency division multiplexing. Optimal minimum mean square error (MMSE), adaptive MDMT channel-estimation techniques are derived. The effects of channel-estimation error on MTCM are analyzed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/16637/00768200.pdf","startPage":"851","endPage":"866","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.768200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.768200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16637","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=768200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multivariate modulation and coding for wireless communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation coding","Wireless communication","Adaptive arrays","Antennas and propagation","Communication channels","Impedance","Information analysis","Transmitters","Rayleigh channels","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","channel capacity","multipath channels","Rayleigh channels","trellis coded modulation","adaptive estimation","least mean squares methods","modulation","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multivariate modulation","multivariate coding","wireless communication","information capacity","data rate","adaptive antenna technology","multipath communication channels","multipath-signal propagation","multivariate discrete multitone","multivariate trellis-coded modulation","MTCM","multiplicative-rate","channel-state information","Rayleigh fading","error rate","coded orthogonal-frequency division multiplexing","minimum mean square error","MMSE","adaptive MDMT channel-estimation","channel-estimation error","wireless networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/768200/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","displayDocTitle":"Multivariate modulation and coding for wireless communication","volume":"17","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6277920","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multivariate modulation and coding for wireless communication","sourcePdf":"00768200.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036831S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"75","articleId":"768200","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":768201,"authors":[{"name":"Qinqing Zhang","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, Inc., Holmdel, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Qinqing Zhang","id":"37289945100"},{"name":"S.A.

The main idea is to allow each user to use parallel orthogonal spreading sequences, depending upon its needs. More specifically, each service level is associated with certain combinations of the sequences. We use a code, which we refer to as a \"mapping code\", to form a multidimensional signal constellation. Thus, the data rate can be changed by changing the mapping code. Further, techniques of sequence sharing (reuse) and sequence arrangement (allocation), suitable for packet switching, are proposed; this allows support of multimedia services, while resulting in a reduction of sequence consumption. We evaluate error rates in the presence of multiple access interference (MAI) and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN).

The network offers two classes of service: class-1 (real-time) and class-2 (reliable). We are interested in studying the effect of dynamic spreading gain control (SGC) on the dynamics of multiple access interference (MAI), spectral efficiency, and the quality of service (QoS) experienced by each service class. We first consider a time-slotted system in which class-2 terminals operate in a random access fashion. We show that under optimal (throughput maximizing) dynamic SGC: (1) the optimal retransmission probability is equal to one, and (2) the optimal spreading gain increases linearly, or equivalently, the transmission rate decreases inverse linearly, as the MAI level increases. We then model the system as a continuous-time finite-source queueing system with processor sharing, and obtain an explicit (closed-form) expression for the stationary distribution of the number of active class-1 and class-2 terminals, that is, the MAI level. This distribution is used to derive expressions for various QoS measures and define a capacity or admissible region. The results obtained by simulation and analysis are in extremely close agreement. This work contributes to a better understanding of the relationships between QoS, multiple access interference, and allocation of radio resources in DS-CDMA networks.","doi":"10.1109/49.768205","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/16637/00768205.pdf","startPage":"918","endPage":"927","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.768205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic spreading gain control in multiservice CDMA networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=768205","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/768205/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic spreading gain control in multiservice CDMA networks","volume":"17","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6277925","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic spreading gain control in multiservice CDMA networks","sourcePdf":"00768205.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032573S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"77","articleId":"768205","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":768206,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The capacity estimate (on the uplink) is the number of voice users and data users, at different data rates, that the system can support with quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees (frame error rates (FER), outage probability). This estimate is based on an interference analysis that considers both perfect and imperfect power control, different user distributions in the cell, and the coverage trade-off resulting from hand-set power limitations. Localized interference from high speed data (HSD) users, combined with the effects of power control, adversely impacts voice capacity. The analysis investigates the effect of two important factors on capacity: (1) received power levels for the different classes of users and (2) data user activity. The results obtained are useful in designing power allocation and burst-level admission control strategies to optimize the capacity.","doi":"10.1109/49.768206","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/16637/00768206.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.768206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16637","startPage":"928","endPage":"938","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cellular multicode CDMA capacity for integrated (voice and data) services","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=768206","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cellular multicode CDMA capacity for integrated (voice and data) services","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/768206/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6277926","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cellular multicode CDMA capacity for integrated (voice and data) services","sourcePdf":"00768206.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034589S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"73","articleId":"768206","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":768207,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Geun Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dong Geun Jeong","id":"37274431000"},{"name":"Wha Sook Jeon","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Hansung University, Seoul, South Korea","Department of Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Wha Sook Jeon","id":"37280516300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0733-8716"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0008"}],"articleNumber":"768207","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":94,"citationCountPatent":22,"totalDownloads":289},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Multimedia systems","Downlink","Bandwidth","Mobile communication","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Multimedia databases","Computer simulation","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","multimedia communication","telecommunication traffic","radio links","Markov processes","cellular radio","personal communication networks","digital radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless multimedia services","traffic unbalance","downlink","DS-CDMA","CDMA/TDD system","code division multiple access","time division duplex system","uplink time slots","TDD frame","network operator","traffic pattern","system performance","Markov analysis","computer simulation","frequency utilization","blocking rate reduction","multimedia calls","equal bandwidth","digital cellular services","personal communications services"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a code division multiple access (CDMA) time division duplex (TDD) system for wireless multimedia services with traffic unbalance between uplink and downlink.

However, with a few exceptions, most researchers have emphasized centralized resource allocation algorithms for cellular systems where the base station keeps track of the requirements of the various users and is thus responsible for the management of network resources. Ad hoc wireless local area networks (WLANs), on the other hand, are generally configured as peer-to-peer networks with no centralized hub or controller. Thus resource allocation has to be conducted in a distributed fashion. We address the issue of distributed resource management for multirate DS-CDMA based multimedia WLANs by (1) presenting a distributed resource allocation protocol, known as distributed resource negotiation protocol (DRNP) that builds on the RTS/CTS bandwidth reservation mechanism provided by IEEE 802.111, and provides quality of service (QoS) guarantees through distributed control of resources in DS-CDMA based multimedia WLANs and (2) investigating the performance of various resource allocation schemes within the context of DRNP, in terms of network wide metrics such as overall throughput and blocking rates.","doi":"10.1109/49.768208","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/16637/00768208.pdf","startPage":"947","endPage":"967","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.768208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed resource allocation for DS-CDMA-based multimedia ad hoc wireless LANs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=768208","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/768208/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed resource allocation for DS-CDMA-based multimedia ad hoc wireless LANs","volume":"17","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6277928","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed resource allocation for DS-CDMA-based multimedia ad hoc wireless LANs","sourcePdf":"00768208.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033779S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"40","articleId":"768208","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":768209,"authors":[{"name":"Dongwoo Kim","affiliation":["R&D Center, Shinsegi Telecomm, Inc., Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dongwoo Kim","id":"37068059500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0733-8716"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0008"}],"articleNumber":"768209","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":52,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":109},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Intelligent networks","Multiaccess communication","Interference","Fluctuations","Radio transmitters","Mobile communication","Communication system control","Mobile computing","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","land mobile radio","radio networks","telecommunication control","power control","radiofrequency interference","radio transmitters","telecommunication traffic","data communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDMA mobile networks","rate-regulated power control","code division multiple access","transmitted power","flexible transmission","RFI","minimum carrier-to-interference ratio","transmission rate","power control algorithms","time-varying transmission rates","signal quality","traffic-carrying performance","simulation","burst data transmission"]}],"abstract":"In code division multiple access (CDMA) mobile networks, transmitted power is controlled to provide each user an acceptable connection by limiting the interference seen by other users.

The new method is based on the staggered resource allocation (SRA) algorithm with consideration of reception quality at terminals. Terminals are categorized into multiple classes, depending on their ability to tolerate concurrent packet transmissions. The purpose of the ESRA method is to maximize concurrent transmissions up to an extent tolerable by the receiving terminals for throughput improvement, while avoiding major cochannel interference in the networks where frequency is reused very aggressively. For practical radio parameters, the ESRA method provides 98.69% coverage and yields a maximum downlink throughput of 36.10% per sector while meeting a 15 dB signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). As for the uplink, using full power control, the throughput reaches 16.7% per sector with a packet loss probability of less than 5/spl times/10/sup -4/. The high ESRA throughput translates into a very large network capacity, and the high quality of service reveals that the new method can support real-time traffic such as voice and video, as expected in future broadband multimedia services in fixed wireless networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/768211/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","volume":"17","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"6277931","publicationDate":"May 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic allocation of downlink and uplink resource for broadband services in fixed wireless networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic allocation of downlink and uplink resource for broadband services in fixed wireless networks","sourcePdf":"00768211.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038005S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"38","articleId":"768211","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":768251,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The Internet lacks support for quality of service (QoS) assurance, which makes the transmission of real-time traffic challenging. In addition, the heterogeneity of the Internet's transmission resources and end-systems makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to agree on acceptable traffic characteristics among multiple receivers of the same video stream. We survey techniques that have been proposed for transmitting video in this environment. These generally involve adaptation of video traffic carried over the network to match receiver requirements and network conditions. In addition to their applicability to the near-term capabilities of the Internet, they also are of relevance to a future, QoS-aware Internet environment. We first consider source-based techniques in which the source adjusts the video stream traffic to match some consensus among the receivers about its desired characteristics. These techniques can result in an unfair treatment for receivers, especially those whose capability is significantly above or below the group consensus. We then consider techniques that aim to improve the fairness among the receivers by sending the video in multiple (layered or replicated) streams. We also discuss several error control mechanisms, using timely retransmission of missing data to further improve the quality of the received video. Finally, we discuss some of the issues in the development of Internet video multicast protocols.","doi":"10.1109/65.768488","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","pdfPath":"/iel5/65/16652/00768488.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/65.768488","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","startPage":"46","endPage":"60","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video multicast over the Internet","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=768488","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 1999","displayDocTitle":"Video multicast over the Internet","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/768488/","volume":"13","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March-April 1999","accessionNumber":"6268357","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video multicast over the Internet","sourcePdf":"00768488.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053398S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 1999","isNumber":"16652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"74","articleId":"768488","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":768496,"authors":[{"name":"M.

However, the interaction of multiple microarchitecture features is often counterintuitive, raising questions concerning potential performance benefits and other effects on various workloads. Complex design trade-offs require accurate and timely performance modeling, which in turn requires flexible, efficient environments for exploring microarchitecture processor performance. Workload-driven simulation models are essential for microprocessor design space exploration. A processor model must ideally: capture in sufficient detail those features that are already well defined; make evolving assumptions and approximations in interpreting the desired execution semantics for those features that are not yet well defined; and be validated against the existing specification. These requirements suggest the need for an evolving but reasonably precise specification, so that validating against such a specification provides confidence in the results. Processor model validation normally relies on behavioral timing specifications based on test cases that exercise the microarchitecture. This approach, commonly used in simulation-based functional validation methods, is also useful for performance validation. In this article, we describe a workload driven simulation environment for PowerPC processor microarchitecture performance exploration. We summarize the environment's properties and give examples of its usage.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/40.768496","doi":"10.1109/40.768496","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Micro","pdfPath":"/iel5/40/16651/00768496.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"25","publicationTitle":"IEEE Micro","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16651","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Environment for PowerPC microarchitecture exploration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Environment for PowerPC microarchitecture exploration","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/768496/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May/Jun 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May-June 1999","accessionNumber":"6266621","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May/Jun 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Environment for PowerPC microarchitecture exploration","sourcePdf":"00768496.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029689S","chronDate":"May/Jun 1999","isNumber":"16651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"40","citationCount":"69","articleId":"768496","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":768506,"authors":[{"name":"T.

It needs n clock pairs to control the pumping process, MPVD is a minimum capacitance realization of the switched-capacitor based voltage doubler. An n-stage MPVD needs n+1 capacitors and 2/sup n/ switches. To avoid the short circuit during switching, a dock pairs generator is used to achieve multi-phase non-overlapping clock pairs. A frequency regulator is designed to lower the charging frequency when the load becomes lighter, thus reducing the power loss during switching. A 2-stage MPVD is implemented in the Orbit 2.0 /spl mu/m analog CMOS technology. The simulation results show that the output voltage is 3.995 times the power supply. By using the frequency regulator, the power efficiency is dramatically improved when the load becomes lighter.","doi":"10.1109/SSMSD.1999.768582","publicationTitle":"1999 Southwest Symposium on Mixed-Signal Design (Cat.

This paper introduces a design approach to CMOS op amps which uses a prefabricated integrated circuit and yet maintains the flexibility of building almost 90% of the existing op amps. Building blocks that are repeated used in op amp design are identified that allow different architectures to be implemented. The performance is designed through the combination of building blocks and the current selected. The W/L values are not a variable in this approach. Examples are given with simulation results of using the building blocks to design various types of CMOS op amps.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Operational amplifiers","Voltage","Analog integrated circuits","Differential amplifiers","CMOS integrated circuits","Computational geometry","MOSFET circuits","Analog computers","Design engineering","CMOS technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","integrated circuit design","educational courses","electronic engineering education","operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["prefabricated design experience","CMOS op amps","analog integrated circuit design","analog IC design course","prefabricated integrated circuit","op amp design","building blocks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SSMSD.1999.768592","publicationTitle":"1999 Southwest Symposium on Mixed-Signal Design (Cat.

In this paper we analyze the improvement of parallel cancellation when using partial cancellation, and provide additional insight into the gains. Specifically, we show that the decision statistic is biased when linear (soft) estimates of the symbol or channel are used for cancellation. Partial cancellation improves the performance in this case by reducing the decision statistic bias.","doi":"10.1109/26.768754","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/16661/00768754.pdf","startPage":"658","endPage":"661","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.768754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comments on \"Partial parallel interference cancellation for CDMA\"","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=768754","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/768754/","displayDocTitle":"Comments on \"Partial parallel interference cancellation for CDMA\"","volume":"47","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6285428","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comments on \"Partial parallel interference cancellation for CDMA\"","sourcePdf":"00768754.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045559S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"32","articleId":"768754","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":768758,"authors":[{"name":"A.

New expressions for the exact symbol error rates (SER) in fading with diversity combining are derived for any two-dimensional signaling format having polygonal decision boundaries. Maximal ratio combining, equal gain combining, and selection combining are considered. The SER formulas obtained make it possible for the first time to optimize parameters of various constellations precisely and to determine,which constellation has the lowest probability of error. For example, a star constellation such as that specified in the CCITT V.29 standard can be improved by adjusting the amplitude ratios of the points in the constellation to save about 0.63 dB power in AWGN without sacrificing the phase error tolerance, while maintaining the same error rate. The sensitivity of each constellation to phase error is presented and comparisons are made.

Many demodulation schemes have been proposed which take account of inherent multiple-access interference. In this paper, linear interference suppression as proposed by for example Madhow and Honig (194), is compared with conventional demodulation based on power-bandwidth plane. This approach is much more general than the comparison of error rates for specific scenarios as used previously. In case of interference suppression, the spectral efficiency is calculated by a combination of analysis and simulation. The coding and modulation scheme used is characterized within the power-bandwidth plane for a single-cell scenario as well as for a cellular system. In the latter case, some statements which are valid for the single-cell scenario have to be revised.","doi":"10.1109/26.768766","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.768766","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/16661/00768766.pdf","startPage":"722","endPage":"731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral efficiency of CDMA systems with linear MMSE interference suppression","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/768766/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","displayDocTitle":"Spectral efficiency of CDMA systems with linear MMSE interference suppression","volume":"47","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6285439","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral efficiency of CDMA systems with linear MMSE interference suppression","sourcePdf":"00768766.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048204S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"27","articleId":"768766","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":768768,"authors":[{"name":"V.

As in the article by Rusch and Poor (1994), the received sampled signal is modeled as the sum of the spread-spectrum signal (modeled as a finite state independently identically distributed (i.i.d.) process-here we generalize to a finite state Markov chain), narrow-band interference (modeled as a Gaussian autoregressive process), and observation noise (modeled as a zero-mean white Gaussian process). The proposed algorithm combines a recursive hidden Markov model (HMM) estimator, Kalman filter (KF), and the recursive expectation maximization algorithm. The nonlinear filtering techniques for narrow-band interference suppression presented in Rusch and Poor and our proposed HMM-KF algorithm have the same computational cost. Detailed simulation studies show that the HMM-KF algorithm outperforms the filtering techniques in Rusch and Poor. In particular, significant improvements in the bit error rate and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) enhancement are obtained in low to medium SNR. Furthermore, in simulation studies we investigate the effect on the performance of the HMM-KF and the approximate conditional mean (ACM) filter in the paper by Rusch and Poor, when the observation noise variance is increased. As expected, the performance of the HMM-KF and ACM algorithms worsen with increasing observation noise and number of users. However, HMM-KF significantly outperforms ACM in medium to high observation noise.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive nonlinear filters for narrow-band interference suppression in spread-spectrum CDMA systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.768768","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/16661/00768768.pdf","startPage":"742","endPage":"753","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.768768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16661","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=768768","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/768768/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive nonlinear filters for narrow-band interference suppression in spread-spectrum CDMA systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6285441","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive nonlinear filters for narrow-band interference suppression in spread-spectrum CDMA systems","sourcePdf":"00768768.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066742S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"26","articleId":"768768","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":768769,"authors":[{"name":"Byoung-Hoon Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Byoung-Hoon Kim","id":"37334268000"},{"name":"Byeong Gi Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Byeong Gi Lee","id":"37281113300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"768769","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Matched filters","Hardware","Decision support systems","Correlators","Asynchronous transfer mode","Performance analysis","Complexity theory","Signal processing","Signal generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spread spectrum communication","asynchronous transfer mode","code division multiple access","synchronisation","pseudonoise codes","radio receivers","transforms","signal sampling","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DSA","fast DS/CDMA acquisition","distributed sample acquisition","direct-sequence code-division multiple-access","long-period pseudonoise sequence","auxiliary PN sequence","distributed sample scrambling","asynchronous transfer mode","ATM cell transmission","long-period PN sequence generator","transmitter","synchronized igniter sequence","DSS receiver","acquisition time performance","transform domain approach","mean acquisition time","serial-search","DSA scheme","circuit complexity"]}],"abstract":"We propose a new acquisition scheme called distributed sample acquisition (DSA) which is applicable to the direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS/CDMA) system with a long-period pseudonoise (PN) sequence. The proposed scheme lays its foundations on an auxiliary PN sequence called the igniter sequence, which has relatively short period, and the distributed sample scrambling (DSS) technique previously developed for the asynchronous transfer mode cell transmission. In the DSA scheme, acquisition is done in three steps. First, the igniter sequence is synchronized, which normally takes a very short time due to its short period. Second, the state samples of the long-period PN sequence generator in the transmitter, which are conveyed to the receiver over the igniter sequence stream, are determined out of the synchronized igniter sequence. Third, the long-period PN sequence is synchronized by applying the state samples to the DSS receiver. Since the operation of each step takes a very short time, the overall acquisition is done very quickly. We analyze the acquisition time performance of the proposed scheme by taking the transform domain approach, confirming that the resulting mean acquisition time is dramatically reduced. If compared with the existing serial-search scheme, the DSA scheme can perform acquisition about 100 times faster when the period of the PN sequence is 2/sup 15/-1. None the less, the additional circuit complexity for its implementation is very small.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DSA: a distributed sample-based fast DS/CDMA acquisition technique","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.768769","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/16661/00768769.pdf","startPage":"754","endPage":"765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.768769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16661","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=768769","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/768769/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","displayDocTitle":"DSA: a distributed sample-based fast DS/CDMA acquisition technique","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6285442","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DSA: a distributed sample-based fast DS/CDMA acquisition technique","sourcePdf":"00768769.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040664S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"14","articleId":"768769","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":768770,"authors":[{"name":"K.C.

The ferroelectric lens concept uniquely incorporates bulk phase shifting-the array does not contain individual phase shifters-using ferroelectric material. This will reduce the number of phase shifters from (n/spl times/m) to (n+m), where n is the number of columns and m is the number of rows in a phased array. The number of phase shifter drivers and phase shifter controls is also significantly reduced by using row-column beam steering. Thus, the ferroelectric lens concept can potentially lead to low-cost phased arrays. This paper presents the ferroelectric lens concept, theoretical analysis and design, and experimental results. The results indicate that the ferroelectric lens concept is viable and sound. Various phased-array configurations using ferroelectric lens are included.

This method utilizes near-field data to determine an equivalent electric current source over a fictitious surface which encompasses the antenna. This electric current, once determined, can be used to ascertain the near and the far field. This method demonstrates the concept of analytic continuity, i.e., once the value of the electric field is known for one region in space, from a theoretical perspective, its value for any other region can be extrapolated. It is shown that the equivalent electric current produces the correct fields in the regions in front of the antenna regardless of the geometry over which the near-field measurements are made. In this approach, the measured data need not satisfy the Nyquist sampling criteria. An electric field integral equation is developed to relate the near field to the equivalent electric current. A moment method procedure is employed to solve the integral equation by transforming it into a matrix equation. A least-squares solution via singular value decomposition is used to solve the matrix equation. Computations with both synthetic and experimental data, where the near field of several antenna configurations are measured over various geometrical surfaces, illustrate the accuracy of this method.","doi":"10.1109/8.768793","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/16660/00768793.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.768793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16660","startPage":"566","endPage":"573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-field to near/far-field transformation for arbitrary near-field geometry utilizing an equivalent electric current and MoM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=768793","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Near-field to near/far-field transformation for arbitrary near-field geometry utilizing an equivalent electric current and MoM","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/768793/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6278992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-field to near/far-field transformation for arbitrary near-field geometry utilizing an equivalent electric current and MoM","sourcePdf":"00768793.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027502S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"162","articleId":"768793","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":768794,"authors":[{"name":"R.G.

Earlier works attributed the cause of instabilities to the intrinsic construction or makeup of the ABCs, and consequently to the pole-zero distribution of the transfer function that characterizes the boundary condition. We investigate the cause of instability, We focus on axial boundary conditions such as Higdon (1986, 1990), Bayliss-Turkel (1980), and Liao, and show through an empirical study that these ABCs are not intrinsically unstable in their original unmodified forms. Furthermore, we show that the instability typically observed in FDTD open-region simulations is caused by an artifact of the rectangular computational domain, contrary to previously conjectured hypotheses or theories. These findings will have strong implications that can aid in the construction of stable FDTD schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability of absorbing boundary conditions","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.768796","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/16659/00768796.pdf","startPage":"593","endPage":"599","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.768796","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16659","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=768796","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/768796/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","displayDocTitle":"Stability of absorbing boundary conditions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6285305","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability of absorbing boundary conditions","sourcePdf":"00768796.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055534S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"14","articleId":"768796","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":768798,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Yu Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Yung Ta College of Technology and Commerce, Ping Tung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chih-Yu Huang","id":"37351603900"},{"name":"Jian-Yi Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jian-Yi Wu","id":"37366550500"},{"name":"Kin-Lu Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kin-Lu Wong","id":"37278682300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"768798","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":165,"citationCountPatent":19,"totalDownloads":3645},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"Circular polarization (CP) design of microstrip antennas and dielectric resonator (DR) antennas through a cross slot of unequal slot lengths in the ground plane of a microstrip line is demonstrated.

It not only includes all positive characteristics of previous SC converters, including small size, light weight, high power density, and the amenability to IC hybridization, but also has the prominent features of continuous input current waveform and better regulation capability than the traditional SC converters. The problem of conducted electromagnetic interference with the supply network, which generally exists in previous SC converters, is highly suppressed. The concept of energy transfer is achieved by using dual SC step-up converter cells operating in antiphase. Each cell is switching between two topologies for the same duration. The dc voltage conversion ratio is controlled by the current control scheme in order to adjust the charging profile of the capacitors. A generalized n-stage converter is presented and is analyzed by a simplified third-order state-space equation set. The static and dynamic behaviors and the design constraints of the converter are derived. A prototype of the 30 W 5 V/12 V two-stage converter has been built, giving an overall efficiency of 78% with power density of 15 W/in/sup 3/.

The dc voltage conversion ratio is controlled by the gate-source voltage of a quasi-switch in each cell, in order to adjust the charging trajectory of the capacitors. By renouncing inductive elements, the converter can be implemented in small size, light weight, high power density, and it is possible to fabricate it in an IC form. A prototype of a 20 W, 6 V/9 V dc/dc boost converter with overall efficiency of 74% and power density of 10 W/in/sup 3/ has been built.

A new algorithm for three-dimensional (3-D) nonlinear structural registration (warping) of MR scans is presented. The method performs a hierarchically scaled search for a displacement field, maximizing one of several voxel similarity measures derived from the two-dimensional (2-D) histogram of matched image intensities, subject to a regularizer that ensures smoothness of the displacement field. The effect of the nonlinear structural registration is studied when it is computed on anatomical MR scans and applied to coregistered [/sup 15/O] water PET scans from the same subjects: in this experiment, a study of visually guided saccadic eye movements. The performance of the nonlinear warp is evaluated using multivariate functional signal and noise measures. These measures prove to be useful for comparing different intersubject registration approaches, e.g., affine versus nonlinear. A comparison of 12-parameter affine registration versus nonlinear registration demonstrates that the proposed nonlinear method increases the number of voxels retained in the cross-subject mask. The authors demonstrate that improved structural registration may result in an improved multivariate functional signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, registration of PET scans using the 12-parameter affine transformations that align the coregistered MR images does not improve registration, compared to 12-parameter affine alignment of the PET images directly.","doi":"10.1109/42.768840","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","startPage":"306","endPage":"319","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/16657/00768840.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.768840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16657","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing the multivariate signal of [/sup 15/O] water PET studies with a new nonlinear neuroanatomical registration algorithm [MRI application]","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Positron emission tomography","Biomedical imaging","Nervous system","Anatomy","Performance evaluation","Displacement measurement","Two dimensional displays","Histograms","Noise measurement","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image registration","medical image processing","positron emission tomography","image enhancement","biomedical MRI","brain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nuclear medicine","[/sup 15/O] water PET studies","multivariate signal enhancement","three-dimensional nonlinear structural registration","MR scans warping","medical diagnostic imaging","visually guided saccadic eye movements","nonlinear warp","multivariate functional signal","intersubject registration approaches","12-parameter affine registration","nonlinear registration","cross-subject mask","magnetic resonance imaging","functional signal-to-noise ratio","coregistered MR images","H/sub 2/O"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Analysis of Variance","Brain","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Models, Theoretical","Tomography, Emission-Computed"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1999","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing the multivariate signal of [/sup 15/O] water PET studies with a new nonlinear neuroanatomical registration algorithm [MRI application]","volume":"18","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6283952","pubMedId":"10385288","publicationDate":"April 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/768840/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing the multivariate signal of [/sup 15/O] water PET studies with a new nonlinear neuroanatomical registration algorithm [MRI application]","sourcePdf":"00768840.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078556S","chronDate":"April  1999","isNumber":"16657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"38","articleId":"768840","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":768842,"authors":[{"name":"T.S.

Contour identification, however, is time consuming and requires a considerable amount of user intervention. In this paper, a new method for identifying tag lines, which the authors call the ML/MAP method, is presented that does not require user defined myocardial contours. The ML/MAP method is composed of three stages. First, a set of candidate tag line centers is estimated across the entire region-of-interest (ROI) with a snake algorithm based on a maximum-likelihood (ML) estimate of the tag center. Next, a maximum a posteriori (MAP) hypothesis test is used to detect the candidate tag centers that are actually part of a tag line. Finally, a pruning algorithm is used to remove any detected tag line centers that do not meet a spatio-temporal continuity criterion. The ML/MAP method is demonstrated on data from ten in vivo human hearts.","doi":"10.1109/42.768842","startPage":"330","endPage":"344","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.768842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16657","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/16657/00768842.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation and detection of myocardial tags in MR image without user-defined myocardial contours","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/768842/","displayDocTitle":"Estimation and detection of myocardial tags in MR image without user-defined myocardial contours","volume":"18","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6283954","pubMedId":"10385290","publicationDate":"April 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation and detection of myocardial tags in MR image without user-defined myocardial contours","sourcePdf":"00768842.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041696S","chronDate":"April  1999","isNumber":"16657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"38","articleId":"768842","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":768843,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Here, a new methodology based on least squares estimation is proposed to correct the nonlinear distortion in the endoscopic images. A mathematical model based on polynomial mapping is used to map the images from distorted image space onto the corrected image space. The model parameters include the polynomial coefficients, distortion center, and corrected center. The proposed method utilizes a line search approach of global convergence for the iterative procedure to obtain the optimum expansion coefficients. A new technique to find the distortion center of the image based on curvature criterion is presented. A dual-step approach comprising token matching and integrated neighborhood search is also proposed for accurate extraction of the centers of the dots contained in a rectangular grid, used for the model parameter estimation. The model parameters were verified with different grid patterns. The distortion correction model is applied to several gastrointestinal images and the results are presented. The proposed technique provides high-speed response and forms a key step toward online camera calibration, which is required for accurate quantitative analysis of the images.","doi":"10.1109/42.768843","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/16657/00768843.pdf","startPage":"345","endPage":"354","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.768843","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16657","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach for nonlinear distortion correction in endoscopic images based on least squares estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=768843","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/768843/","displayDocTitle":"A new approach for nonlinear distortion correction in endoscopic images based on least squares estimation","volume":"18","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6283955","pubMedId":"10385291","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach for nonlinear distortion correction in endoscopic images based on least squares estimation","sourcePdf":"00768843.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039724S","chronDate":"April  1999","isNumber":"16657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"93","articleId":"768843","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":768849,"authors":[{"name":"A.B.

Like adjustable speed drives, fault prognosis has become almost indispensable. The manufacturers of these drives are now keen to include diagnostic features in the software to decrease machine down time and improve salability. Prodigious improvement in signal processing hardware and software has made this possible. Primarily, these techniques depend upon locating specific harmonic components in the line current, also known as motor current signal analysis (MCSA). These harmonic components are usually different for different types of faults. However with multiple faults or different varieties of drive schemes, MCSA can become an onerous task as different types of faults and time harmonics may end up generating similar signatures. Thus other signals such as speed, torque, noise, vibration etc., are also explored for their frequency contents. Sometimes, altogether different techniques such as thermal measurements, chemical analysis, etc., are also employed to find out the nature and the degree of the fault. It is indeed evident that this area is vast in scope. Hence, keeping in mind the need for future research, a review paper describing the different types of fault and the signatures they generate and their diagnostics schemes, will not be entirely out of place. In particular, such a review helps to avoid repetition of past work and gives a bird's eye-view to a new researcher in this area.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault diagnosis of electrical machines-a review","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference.

Also, conventional linear estimators are not adaptive. In this paper, two neural network-based model reference adaptive systems (MRAS) for position and speed estimation are presented for PMSM drives. The first network estimates the rotor speed and adapts online to any change in stator resistance. The second network estimates the rotor position and adapts online for any changes in the torque constant. A q-axis model for stator inductance based on current is used. In both cases, the MRAS adjusts the neural weights to give optimal performance over a wide speed range.

From past experience, the unbalance of DC-link voltage in three-level inverters causes a low power factor and increased harmonics to induction motors of traction vehicles. The proposed current control scheme offers \"tight DC-link voltage balancing\" for the inverter along with nonlinear mapping of essential switching patterns and fault tolerance, which are inherent characteristics of NNs. A computer simulation shows that a new current control scheme provides a comparable performance to a conventional sinusoidal pulse-width-modulation (SPWM) control in many aspects.","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.1999.769096","pdfPath":"/iel5/6235/16654/00769096.pdf","startPage":"293","endPage":"295","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference.

A major drawback of the conventional DTC is an unpredictable inverter switching frequency which varies due to operating speed, load condition and parameters of the induction machine. Therefore the amplitude of the hysteresis band should be large enough to avoid excessive inverter switching at any operating region, which inevitably causes relatively large torque ripple especially in the low speed region. This paper proposes an effective switching frequency regulation method which consists of hysteresis band controller and switching frequency command generator. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is analyzed and compared with the conventional method.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque control","Induction machines","Hysteresis","Switching frequency","Stators","Inverters","Electric variables control","Voltage","Sampling methods","Paper making machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous machines","machine control","torque control","machine theory","control system synthesis","switching circuits","DC-AC power convertors","invertors","frequency control","control system analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction machine","direct torque control","variable amplitude flux control","torque hysteresis bands","invertor switching frequency","control design","operating speed","load condition","machine parameters","torque ripple","low speed region","switching frequency regulation method","switching frequency command generator","control simulation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.1999.769200","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference.

In particular, we argue that in order for the mobile access network to support low-bit-rate delay-sensitive traffic consisting of short packets, the standardization of a new ATM adaptation layer, AAL2, and associated signaling protocol has been necessary. The AAL2 protocol has been designed to support low-bit-rate delay-sensitive services (typically compressed voice) where other adaptation layers fail to deliver the required QoS and maintain efficient resource utilization at the same time. Furthermore, in order to provide mobility and soft handover support in W-CDMA-based mobile networks such as UMTS or IMT-2000, there is also a strong demand for fast connection establishment and release. Therefore, when designing ATM-based cellular access networks some specific architectural and traffic management issues need to be addressed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/16672/00769285.pdf","startPage":"112","endPage":"123","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/35.769285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.769285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16672","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=769285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying ATM/AAL2 as a switching technology in third-generation mobile access networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Asynchronous transfer mode","Intelligent networks","3G mobile communication","Telecommunication traffic","Standardization","Multimedia systems","Access protocols","Telecommunication standards","Resource management","IP networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous transfer mode","radio access networks","cellular radio","standardisation","telecommunication traffic","telecommunication network management","delays","packet radio networks","telecommunication signalling","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["third-generation mobile access networks","switching technology","ATM/AAL2","transport","low-bit-rate delay-sensitive traffic","short packets","standardization","ATM adaptation layer","signaling protocol","AAL2 protocol","compressed voice","adaptation layers","QoS","efficient resource utilization","soft handover","W-CDMA","UMTS","IMT-2000","fast connection establishment","fast connection release","cellular access networks","traffic management","network architecture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/769285/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1999","displayDocTitle":"Applying ATM/AAL2 as a switching technology in third-generation mobile access networks","volume":"37","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1999","accessionNumber":"6279302","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying ATM/AAL2 as a switching technology in third-generation mobile access networks","sourcePdf":"00769285.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041661S","chronDate":"June  1999","isNumber":"16672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"32","articleId":"769285","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":769289,"authors":[{"name":"H.D.

The off-ramp consists of synchronized fiber lasers driving an all-optical header processor that includes nonlinear optical loop mirrors (NOLM), electrooptic router, and demultiplexer in the form of a two-wavelength NOLM. We achieve switching contrasts of 10:1 for the header processor and demultiplexer with switching energies of 10 pJ and 1 pJ, respectively. Also, a proposed measurement technique to obtain eye diagrams is used to analyze the all-optical header processor using the synchronized lasers. Using this technique, we obtain an eye diagram with a Q value of 7.1/spl plusmn/0.36, which corresponds to a worst case BER value of 8.8/spl times/10/sup -12/ for a 95% confidence level. Finally, simulation models are used to verify and compare the experimental results, and we find good agreement.

In practical hybrid SCM, however, carriers are modulated by video signals or digital data, and the amplitude of a multiplexed signal composed of these modulation signals is more compressed than that of the carriers. This causes a decrease in the frequency of clipping of the multiplexed signal at the laser threshold. Consequently, the BER of the M-QAM signal in a practical hybrid SCM is lower than that of the experimental results for the same optical modulation index (OMI). However, it is difficult to prepare many practical modulation signals for experiments in a laboratory. Therefore, there is demand for a bit error rate (BER) analysis method for a multiplexed signal that includes the modulation signals needed to sufficiently evaluate the BER and determine the optimum OMI in a practical hybrid SCM. In this paper, we describe such a BER analysis method that can effectively estimate the BER in a practical hybrid SCM. In practical systems, the BER was greatly improved over the BER of a multiplexed signal of carriers. Furthermore, BER degradations due to clipping can be neglected for the AM signals in setting a practical OMI range. We used this analysis method to study the effective OMI range of AM and M-QAM signals. By assuming modulation signals, the OMI range is enlarged and, significantly, the OMI of an AM signal becomes suitable for setting practical values in AM-SCM transmission. This OMI range is more practical than those of former studies.","doi":"10.1109/50.769301","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/16675/00769301.pdf","startPage":"1011","endPage":"1017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.769301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16675","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of BER of 64-QAM signal and OMI-window of feasible operation in analog/digital hybrid SCM transmission systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=769301","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/769301/","displayDocTitle":"Study of BER of 64-QAM signal and OMI-window of feasible operation in analog/digital hybrid SCM transmission systems","volume":"17","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1999","accessionNumber":"6284255","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of BER of 64-QAM signal and OMI-window of feasible operation in analog/digital hybrid SCM transmission systems","sourcePdf":"00769301.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041912S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16675","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"5","articleId":"769301","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":769302,"authors":[{"name":"Rongqing Hui","affiliation":["Information and Telecommunication Technology Center, the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA"],"lastName":"Rongqing Hui","id":"37276273700"},{"name":"K.R.

Such a method, however, cannot efficiently and accurately account for two-terminal networks made of several lumped elements, arbitrarily connected together. This limitation can be removed as proposed in this paper by describing the network in terms of its impedance in the Laplace domain and by using appropriate digital signal-processing methodologies to fit the resulting description to Yee's algorithm. The resulting difference equations allow an arbitrary two-terminal network to be inserted into one FDTD cell, preserving the full explicit nature of the conventional FDTD scheme and requiring a minimum number of additional storage variables. The new approach has been validated by comparison with the exact solution of a parallel-plate waveguide loaded with lumped networks in the transverse plane.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/16668/00769330.pdf","startPage":"943","endPage":"949","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.769330","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.769330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16668","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=769330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new algorithm for the incorporation of arbitrary linear lumped networks into FDTD simulators","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","RLC circuits","Circuit simulation","Electromagnetic radiation","Electromagnetic analysis","Associate members","Impedance","Difference equations","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lumped parameter networks","linear network analysis","circuit simulation","finite difference time-domain analysis","multiterminal networks","parallel plate waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear lumped element network","FDTD simulation","finite difference time domain method","two-terminal network","Laplace domain","digital signal processing","Yee algorithm","parallel plate waveguide","impedance","global model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/769330/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","displayDocTitle":"A new algorithm for the incorporation of arbitrary linear lumped networks into FDTD simulators","volume":"47","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1999","accessionNumber":"6291137","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new algorithm for the incorporation of arbitrary linear lumped networks into FDTD simulators","sourcePdf":"00769330.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036323S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"57","articleId":"769330","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":769331,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The model is based on the self-consistent solution of Maxwell's equation and of semiconductor transport equations, exploiting a generalized finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) scheme. The tool is, therefore, capable of accounting, on a distributed basis, for actual interactions between wave propagation and charge transport, anti is capable of providing a physically based picture of traveling-wave semiconductor devices. The implementation is such that more conventional algorithms (e.g. lumped-element FDTD or plain FDTD) can be regarded as a subset of the global scheme itself. This makes it possible to intermix different physical models, featuring different degrees of physical accuracy and computational efficiency, within the same simulation environment. Main features of such an environment are described by means of the simulation of a simple 76-GHz distributed switch.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/769331/","volume":"47","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"6291138","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Global modeling strategies for the analysis of high-frequency integrated circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global modeling strategies for the analysis of high-frequency integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"00769331.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051964S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"21","articleId":"769331","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":769334,"authors":[{"name":"T.B.

In addition to the dc current sources, the model contains two quasi-static charge sources and a dynamic radio frequency (RF) current source, which depends on the temperature rise. By introducing the dynamic RF current source, the problem of path dependence, which occurs in modeling large-size devices and devices with dispersion, is resolved. All equivalent elements are obtained by cubic spline interpolation. Extrapolation of the model beyond the measurement range is taken into account. The model is extracted by an in-house software without involving optimization. The validity of the model is demonstrated by comparing the simulation of small-signal S-parameters over a wide bias range, as well as power, linearity, and waveform characteristics to the measured data.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["FETs","Assembly","Radio frequency","Scattering parameters","Equivalent circuits","Circuit simulation","Temperature dependence","Spline","Interpolation","Extrapolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave field effect transistors","UHF field effect transistors","equivalent circuits","S-parameters","semiconductor device models","Schottky gate field effect transistors","splines (mathematics)","interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic FET model","small-signal S-parameters","data-table-based large-signal model","metal-semiconductor field-effect transistor","bias-dependent small-signal equivalent circuits","data-acquisition bias range","dc current sources","quasi-static charge sources","dynamic radio frequency (RF) current source","temperature rise","cubic spline interpolation","waveform characteristics","microwave FETs","UHF FETs"]}],"doi":"10.1109/22.769338","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/16667/00769338.pdf","startPage":"700","endPage":"705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16667","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.769338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Table-based dynamic FET model assembled from small-signal models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=769338","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Table-based dynamic FET model assembled from small-signal models","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/769338/","volume":"47","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6285335","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Table-based dynamic FET model assembled from small-signal models","sourcePdf":"00769338.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0659S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"12","articleId":"769338","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":769342,"authors":[{"name":"C.G.

New design equations for T3PDs are derived. They can be applied to T3PDs with both different termination impedances and, especially, a 3-dB power division. If a T3PD is terminated by different impedances, scattering parameters cannot be derived with conventional even- and odd-mode methods. Under these conditions, basis-independent normalized scattering parameters are derived. As these scattering parameters are only dependent on the ratio of R/sub c/ to R/sub b/ (where R/sub c/ and R/sub b/ are two termination impedances that are connected with an isolation resistor), the ratio of R/sub c/ to R/sub b/ \"t\" is introduced to analyze all load conditions and the derived scattering parameters are proven to be correct by a commercial program. For the frequency-response characteristics, a T3PD terminated by 40, 50, and 60 /spl Omega/ has been simulated using ideal transmission lines. Also, a simple method for determining the exact values of two indispensable elements-coplanar rectangular inductances (C-RINDs) and coplanar metal-insulator-metal capacitors (C-MIMs)-in coplanar monolithic-microwave integrated-circuit (C-MMIC) technology is presented using a resonator technique.

Comparisons between the performance of specially designed HBT distributed amplifiers and the results obtained using the HBT unilateral model demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heterojunction bipolar transistors","Distributed amplifiers","FETs","Predictive models","Cutoff frequency","Equivalent circuits","HEMTs","Attenuation","Field effect MMICs","Distributed computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterojunction bipolar transistors","semiconductor device models","equivalent circuits","distributed amplifiers","MMIC amplifiers","microwave bipolar transistors","bipolar MMIC","integrated circuit design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HBT unilateral model","distributed amplifier design","heterojunction bipolar transistor","HBT MMIC amplifiers","HBT parasitics","graphical design procedure"]}],"doi":"10.1109/22.769352","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/16667/00769352.pdf","startPage":"795","endPage":"798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16667","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.769352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An HBT unilateral model to design distributed amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=769352","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An HBT unilateral model to design distributed amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/769352/","volume":"47","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6291118","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An HBT unilateral model to design distributed amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00769352.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025617S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"1","articleId":"769352","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":769360,"authors":[{"name":"G.A.

Pneumatic sensors were fabricated from open-cell polymeric foam, and were interposed between the prosthetic socket and superficial extrinsic tendons associated with individual finger flexion. Test subjects were prompted to move individual fingers or combinations thereof to execute either taps or grasps. Sensor outputs were processed by a computer that controlled motions of individual fingers on a mechanical prosthesis. Trials on three upper-limb amputees showed that after brief training sessions, the TAP controller was effective at producing voluntary flexions of individual fingers and grasping motions. Signal energies were between 5 and 25 dB relative to noise from all sources, including adjacent sensors, indicating high degrees of both sensitivity and specificity for tendon-associated transduction. Finger flexions at up to three repetitions per second, and rhythmic tapping of sequential fingers were readily transduced. One amputee subject was able to play a short piano piece with three fingers, at approximately one-quarter normal tempo. TAP sensors responded linearly to graded forces from individual fingers, indicating proportional force control. The authors' results demonstrate the feasibility of restoring some degree of finger dexterity by noninvasive sensing of extrinsic tendons.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/769401/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1999","publicationDate":"June 1999","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6287508","pubMedId":"10391581","volume":"7","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A biomimetic controller for a multifinger prosthesis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A biomimetic controller for a multifinger prosthesis","sourcePdf":"00769401.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080002S","chronDate":"June  1999","isNumber":"16664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"86","citationCount":"45","articleId":"769401","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":769408,"authors":[{"name":"R.B.

A hand-held instrumented hammer was used to tap the patellar tendon and to elicit the reflex response. Tendon reflex dynamics were estimated using the recorded tapping force (as input) and the quadriceps muscle electromyogram and knee joint extension torque signals (as output). A dome shaped rubber pad was mounted onto the most sensitive spot on the patellar tendon, where it served as a tapping target, and helped to reduce the reflex variability significantly (p<0.01). The input-output properties of the system relating the reflex torque to the tapping force were characterized using several measures: the tendon reflex gain (G/sub tr/), contraction rate (R/sub c/), and half-relaxation rate (R/sub hr/). Reflex loop delay (t/sub d/) was estimated using the delay from the onset of tapping force to the onset of reflex torque. We determined that these system parameters provided significantly more repeatable and consistent characterization of tendon reflexes than did reflexive torque or EMG signals alone (p<0.025). The input-output relationship relating the EMG signals of the stretched muscle to the tapping force was also identified to help characterize neuromuscular dynamics of tendon reflexes. The observed sensitivity and consistency of the reflex system measures suggest that with appropriate simplification of the instrumentation, these methods may prove useful in routine clinical practice, and may allow more precise quantification of the tendon jerk than is currently feasible with standard clinical tests.","doi":"10.1109/86.769410","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/86/16664/00769410.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/86.769410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16664","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System identification of tendon reflex dynamics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/769410/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1999","displayDocTitle":"System identification of tendon reflex dynamics","volume":"7","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1999","accessionNumber":"6293501","pubMedId":"10391590","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System identification of tendon reflex dynamics","sourcePdf":"00769410.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04247S","chronDate":"June  1999","isNumber":"16664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"86","citationCount":"36","articleId":"769410","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":769411,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The implant system is adaptable to patient's needs and to future developments in stimulation algorithms by reprogramming the stimulator. The stimulator is capable of generating a wide range of stimulation waveforms and stimulation patterns and therefore is very suitable for selective nerve stimulation techniques. The reliability of the implant has been increased by using a forward error detection and correction communication protocol and by designing the chip for structural testability based on scan test approach. Implemented testability scheme makes it possible to verify the complete functionality of the implant before and after implantation. The stimulators architecture is designed to be modular and therefore its different blocks can be reused as standard building blocks in the design and implementation of other neuromuscular prostheses.

GRASP incorporates several search-pruning techniques that proved to be quite powerful on a wide variety of SAT problems. Some of these techniques are specific to SAT, whereas others are similar in spirit to approaches in other fields of Artificial Intelligence. GRASP is premised on the inevitability of conflicts during the search and its most distinguishing feature is the augmentation of basic backtracking search with a powerful conflict analysis procedure. Analyzing conflicts to determine their causes enables GRASP to backtrack nonchronologically to earlier levels in the search tree, potentially pruning large portions of the search space. In addition, by \"recording\" the causes of conflicts, GRASP can recognize and preempt the occurrence of similar conflicts later on in the search. Finally, straightforward bookkeeping of the causality chains leading up to conflicts allows GRASP to identify assignments that are necessary for a solution to be found. Experimental results obtained from a large number of benchmarks indicate that application of the proposed conflict analysis techniques to SAT algorithms can be extremely effective for a large number of representative classes of SAT instances.","doi":"10.1109/12.769433","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/16670/00769433.pdf","startPage":"506","endPage":"521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.769433","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GRASP: a search algorithm for propositional satisfiability","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=769433","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/769433/","displayDocTitle":"GRASP: a search algorithm for propositional satisfiability","volume":"48","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6278998","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GRASP: a search algorithm for propositional satisfiability","sourcePdf":"00769433.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048067S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"745","articleId":"769433","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":769434,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Researchers have proposed using compilers, operating systems, or architectures to improve performance by allocating data close to the processors that use it.

Each memory module acts as a huge cache memory in which each block has a tag with the address and the state.

The new equations are found to be stable even with the maximum allowed time step, easy to implement, and do not increase computer memory and time requirements.","doi":"10.1109/75.769527","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/75/16686/00769527.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/75.769527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16686","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of sharp metal edges at 45/spl deg/ to the FDTD grid","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=769527","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/769527/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of sharp metal edges at 45/spl deg/ to the FDTD grid","volume":"9","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1999","accessionNumber":"6286965","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of sharp metal edges at 45/spl deg/ to the FDTD grid","sourcePdf":"00769527.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038406S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"75","citationCount":"12","articleId":"769527","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":769537,"authors":[{"name":"H.

A prototype device, designed for flexible interfacing to typical machine tool controllers, is described, along with performance testing data of tilted flat and off-axis conic sections. Techniques for controlling the piezoelectric actuator to less than 1% error are discussed. The performance of a standard integral controller shows a significant error due to hysteresis in the actuator. The effects of the hysteresis were reduced by implementing two control schemes, an optimized PID controller and a technique that utilizes a dynamic compensator module in conjunction with the linear controller. The compensator samples the hysteretic voltage/displacement relationship in real time and modifies the effective gain accordingly. Experimental implementation results in an 80% reduction in the motion error caused by hysteresis, but peak-to-valley errors are limited by side effects from the compensation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/769543/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6284080","volume":"4","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance optimization of a fast tool servo for single-point diamond turning machines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance optimization of a fast tool servo for single-point diamond turning machines","sourcePdf":"00769543.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061935S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"84","articleId":"769543","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":769633,"authors":[{"name":"P.S.

FASANT can obtain far-field patterns, field levels at points near the structure, can calculate the mutual coupling between antennas or between array elements, and can show each ray-tracing mechanism.","doi":"10.1109/74.769696","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/74/16691/00769696.pdf","startPage":"94","endPage":"98","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/74.769696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16691","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FASANT: past computer tool for the analysis of on-board antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=769696","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/769696/","displayDocTitle":"FASANT: past computer tool for the analysis of on-board antennas","volume":"41","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6280572","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FASANT: past computer tool for the analysis of on-board antennas","sourcePdf":"00769696.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032201S","chronDate":"April  1999","isNumber":"16691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"20","articleId":"769696","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":769717,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Franke","affiliation":["Applied Physics Program, University of Michigan, Technical University of Munich, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Franke","id":"37884379200"},{"name":"H.G.

In this paper, a novel medium access control (MAC) protocol called wireless multimedia access control protocol with BER scheduling (in short form, WISPER) for CDMA-based systems is proposed. WISPER utilizes the novel idea of scheduling the transmission of multimedia packets according to their BER requirements. The scheduler assigns priorities to the packets, and performs an iterative procedure to determine a good accommodation of the highest-priority packets in the slots of a frame so that packets with equal or similar BER requirements are transmitted in the same slots. The proposed WISPER protocol has been validated using a software emulator on the cellular environment.

The extra length is referred to here as the overhead of the encoding. To date, byte stuffing algorithms, such as those used by SLIP, PPP, and AX.25, have been designed to incur low average overhead, but little effort has been made to minimize their worst-case overhead. However, there are some increasingly popular network devices whose performance is determined more by the worst case than by the average case. For example, the transmission time for ISM-band packet radio transmitters is strictly limited by FCC regulation. To adhere to this regulation, the current practice is to set the maximum packet size artificially low so that no packet, even after worst-case overhead, can exceed the transmission time limit. This paper presents a new byte stuffing algorithm, called consistent overhead byte stuffing (COBS), which tightly bounds the worst-case overhead. It guarantees, in the worst case, to add no more than 1 byte in 254 to any packet. For large packets, this means that their encoded size is no more than 100.4% of their pre-encoding size. This is much better than the 200% worst-case bound that is common for many byte stuffing algorithms, and is close to the information-theoretic limit of about 100.07%. Furthermore, the COBS algorithm is computationally cheap, and its average overhead is very competitive with that of existing algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/769765/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","volume":"7","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6281046","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Consistent overhead byte stuffing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consistent overhead byte stuffing","sourcePdf":"00769765.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039914S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"14","articleId":"769765","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":769767,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Most often, these systems use input queues to hold packets waiting to traverse the switching fabric. It is well known that if simple first in first out (FIFO) input queues are used to hold packets then, even under benign conditions, head-of-line (HOL) blocking limits the achievable bandwidth to approximately 58.6% of the maximum. HOL blocking can be overcome by the use of virtual output queueing, which is described in this paper. A scheduling algorithm is used to configure the crossbar switch, deciding the order in which packets will be served. Previous results have shown that with a suitable scheduling algorithm, 100% throughput can be achieved. In this paper, we present a scheduling algorithm called iSLIP. An iterative, round-robin algorithm, iSLIP can achieve 100% throughput for uniform traffic, yet is simple to implement in hardware. Iterative and noniterative versions of the algorithms are presented, along with modified versions for prioritized traffic. Simulation results are presented to indicate the performance of iSLIP under benign and bursty traffic conditions. Prototype and commercial implementations of iSLIP exist in systems with aggregate bandwidths ranging from 50 to 500 Gb/s. When the traffic is nonuniform, iSLIP quickly adapts to a fair scheduling policy that is guaranteed never to starve an input queue. Finally, we describe the implementation complexity of iSLIP. Based on a two-dimensional (2-D) array of priority encoders, single-chip schedulers have been built supporting up to 32 ports, and making approximately 100 million scheduling decisions per second.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/16693/00769767.pdf","startPage":"188","endPage":"201","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/90.769767","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.769767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16693","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=769767","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The iSLIP scheduling algorithm for input-queued switches","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scheduling algorithm","Switches","Traffic control","Asynchronous transfer mode","Packet switching","Bandwidth","Throughput","Iterative algorithms","Round robin","Internetworking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["internetworking","asynchronous transfer mode","transport protocols","queueing theory","local area networks","telecommunication network routing","iterated switching networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iSLIP scheduling algorithm","input-queued switches","high performance internetworking protocol routers","LAN switches","asynchronous transfer mode","ATM switches","switched backplane","crossbar switch","switching fabric","first in first out input queues","FIFO","head-of-line blocking","bandwidth","HOL blocking","virtual output queueing","scheduling algorithm","throughput","iterative round-robin algorithm","prioritized traffic","iterative algorithm","noniterative algorithm","simulation results","bursty traffic","benign traffic","priority encoders","single-chip schedulers","uniform traffic","nonuniform traffic","50 to 500 Gbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/769767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","displayDocTitle":"The iSLIP scheduling algorithm for input-queued switches","volume":"7","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6281048","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The iSLIP scheduling algorithm for input-queued switches","sourcePdf":"00769767.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043336S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"841","articleId":"769767","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":769768,"authors":[{"name":"J.

For stored video applications, the server can smooth the variable-bit-rate stream by transmitting frames into the client playback buffer in advance of each burst. Drawing on prior knowledge of the frame lengths and client buffer size, such bandwidth-smoothing techniques can minimize the peak and variability of the rate requirements while avoiding underflow and overflow of the playback buffer. However, in an internetworking environment, a single service provider typically does not control the entire path from the stored-video server to the client buffer. This paper presents efficient techniques for transmitting variable-bit-rate video across a portion of the route, from an ingress node to an egress node. We develop efficient techniques for minimizing the network bandwidth requirements by characterizing how the peak transmission rate varies as a function of the playback delay and the buffer allocation at the two nodes. We present an efficient algorithm for minimizing both the playback delay and the buffer allocation, subject to a constraint on the peak transmission rate. We then describe how to compute an optimal transmission schedule for a sequence of nodes by solving a collection of independent single-link problems, and show that the optimal resource allocation places all buffers at the ingress and egress nodes. Experiments with motion-JPEG and MPEG traces show the interplay between buffer space, playback delay, and bandwidth requirements for a collection of full-length video traces.","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/16693/00769768.pdf","startPage":"202","endPage":"215","doi":"10.1109/90.769768","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.769768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16693","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smoothing variable-bit-rate video in an internetwork","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/769768/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","displayDocTitle":"Smoothing variable-bit-rate video in an internetwork","publicationDate":"April 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6281049","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smoothing variable-bit-rate video in an internetwork","sourcePdf":"00769768.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081711S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"57","articleId":"769768","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":769770,"authors":[{"name":"Z.J.

In the proposed scheme, location databases are stored in the network nodes themselves, which form a self-organizing virtual backbone within the flat network structure. The databases are dynamically organized into quorums, every two of which intersect at a constant number of databases. Upon location update or call arrival, a mobile's location information is written to or read from all the databases of a quorum, chosen in a nondeterministic manner. Compared with a conventional scheme [such as the use of home location register (HLR)] with fixed associations, this scheme is more suitable for ad hoc networks, where the connectivity of the nodes with the rest of the network can be intermittent and sporadic and the databases are relatively unstable. We introduce UQS, where the size of the quorum intersection is a design parameter that can be tuned to adapt to the traffic and mobility patterns of the network nodes. We propose the construction of UQS through the balanced incomplete block designs. The average cost, due to call loss and location updates using such systems, is analyzed in the presence of database disconnections. Based on the average cost, we investigate the tradeoff between the system reliability and the cost of location updates in the UQS scheme. The problem of optimizing the quorum size under different network traffic and mobility patterns is treated numerically. A dynamic and distributed HLR scheme, as a limiting case of the UQS, is also analyzed and shown to be suboptimal in general. It is also shown that partitioning of the network is sometimes necessary to reduce the cost of mobility management.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.769770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16693","startPage":"228","endPage":"240","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/16693/00769770.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ad hoc mobility management with uniform quorum systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/769770/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Ad hoc mobility management with uniform quorum systems","publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6281051","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ad hoc mobility management with uniform quorum systems","sourcePdf":"00769770.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051436S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"154","articleId":"769770","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":769775,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

The narrow-band filter is composed of a periodic model filter and one or several, possibly periodic, masking filters in cascade. Lattice and bireciprocal lattice WDF filters are used for the model and masking filters, respectively. The wide-band filter consists of a narrow-band filter in parallel with an all-pass filter. The overall filters can be designed by separately designing the model and masking filters. The filters obtained in this approach also serve as good initial filters for further optimization. Both nonlinear and approximately linear phase filters are considered. One major advantage of the new filters over the corresponding conventional filters is that they have a substantially higher maximal sample frequency. In the case of approximately linear phase, the computational complexity can also be reduced. Further, the use of bireciprocal lattice wave digital (WD) masking filters also makes it possible to reduce the complexity, compared with the case in which FIR masking filters are used. Several design examples and a discussion of finite wordlength effects are included for demonstrating the properties of the new filters.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16692","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.769781","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/82/16692/00769781.pdf","startPage":"726","endPage":"741","doi":"10.1109/82.769781","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wave digital filter structures for high-speed narrow-band and wide-band filtering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","displayDocTitle":"Wave digital filter structures for high-speed narrow-band and wide-band filtering","volume":"46","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1999","accessionNumber":"6287047","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/769781/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wave digital filter structures for high-speed narrow-band and wide-band filtering","sourcePdf":"00769781.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071911S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"17","articleId":"769781","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":769783,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Zhu","affiliation":["Center for Signal Processing, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Jie Zhu","id":"37087144043"},{"name":"Xi-Ren Cao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Xi-Ren Cao","id":"37087159715"},{"name":"Ruey-Wen Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Ruey-Wen Liu","id":"37087157299"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7130"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-125X"}],"articleNumber":"769783","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":85},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=769783","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Higher order statistics","Signal processing algorithms","Intersymbol interference","Blind equalizers","Signal processing","Robustness","Statistical distributions","Computational modeling","Digital communication","Phase distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["higher order statistics","blind equalisers","intersymbol interference","digital communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fractionally spaced equalizer","higher order statistics","input symbol sequence","identically distributed finite alphabet","nonzero fourth-order cumulants","column vector","short symbol sequence","channel time span"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a new blind fractionally spaced equalizer based on the fourth-order statistics of the input symbol sequence.

These mismatches along the paths result in the image interference aliasing into the desired signal band, thus reducing the dynamic range and degrading the performance of the receivers. I/Q errors occur because of gain and phase imbalances between quadrature mixers. They are also caused by capacitor mismatches in analog-to-digital converters (A/Ds), which are designed to be identical for each input path. This paper presents a novel and feasible digital signal processing (DSP) solution for the I/Q mismatch problems. The system includes a novel complex least mean square algorithm and a modified adaptive noise canceler (signal separator) to separate the desired signal and the image noise caused by the mismatch. The noise canceler can also solve the signal leakage problem, which is that the noise reference includes signal components. This system was implemented in a Xilinx FPGA and an Analog Devices DSP chip. It was tested with a complex intermediate frequency receiver, which includes an analog front end and a complex sigma-delta modulator. Both simulation results and test results show a dramatic attenuation of the image noise. Extending applications of the system to N-path systems further indicates the robustness and feasibility of this novel adaptive mismatch cancellation system.","doi":"10.1109/82.769786","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/82/16692/00769786.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.769786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16692","startPage":"789","endPage":"801","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel adaptive mismatch cancellation system for quadrature IF radio receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=769786","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel adaptive mismatch cancellation system for quadrature IF radio receivers","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/769786/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1999","accessionNumber":"6287052","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel adaptive mismatch cancellation system for quadrature IF radio receivers","sourcePdf":"00769786.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050648S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"141","articleId":"769786","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":769790,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Chih Hung","affiliation":["Analog VLSI Laboratory, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"lastName":"Chung-Chih Hung","id":"37289818800"},{"name":"M.

Given two n-bit inputs, the fixed-width multipliers generate n-bit (instead of 2 n-bit) products with low product error, but use only about half the area and less delay when compared with a standard parallel multiplier. In them, cost-effective carry-generating circuits are designed, respectively, to make the products generated more accurately and quickly. Applying the same approach, a low error reduced-width multiplier with output bit-width between n- and 2n has also been designed. Experimental results show that the proposed fixed-width and reduced-width multipliers have lower error than all other fixed-width multipliers and are still cost effective. Due to these properties, they are very suitable for use in many multimedia and digital signal processing applications such as digital filtering, arithmetic coding, wavelet transformation, echo cancellation, etc.","doi":"10.1109/82.769795","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16692","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.769795","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/82/16692/00769795.pdf","startPage":"836","endPage":"842","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of low-error fixed-width multipliers for DSP applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","displayDocTitle":"Design of low-error fixed-width multipliers for DSP applications","volume":"46","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1999","accessionNumber":"6287061","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/769795/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of low-error fixed-width multipliers for DSP applications","sourcePdf":"00769795.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046739S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"16692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"58","articleId":"769795","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":769797,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

Matlab is used as a behavior-level simulator. In telecommunications applications, the frequency-domain parameters are of the greatest importance. Therefore, the characterization of the device and its performance is determined by frequency parameters such as the signal-to-noise ratio, spurious-free dynamic range, multitone power ratio, etc. In this paper, we show how these frequency-domain parameters are affected when mismatch errors and finite output impedance are applied to a current-steering CMOS DAC. We discuss how static performance is affected when changing the size of the errors and fundamental circuit parameters. The impact of dynamic errors such as glitches, slewing, and bit skew is discussed. Measurement results from 14-bit DACs are also shown to illustrate the correlation with the modeling.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/769797/","volume":"46","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"6264076","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of CMOS digital-to-analog converters for telecommunication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of CMOS digital-to-analog converters for telecommunication","sourcePdf":"00769797.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029731S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"48","articleId":"769797","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":769806,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Ching Lim","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Yong Ching Lim","id":"37350382800"},{"name":"Rui Yang","affiliation":["HaL Computer Systems, Inc., Campbell, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Rui Yang","id":"37349275500"},{"name":"Dongning Li","affiliation":["Systems Technology Private Limited, Singapore"],"lastName":"Dongning Li","id":"37334774000"},{"name":"Jianjian Song","affiliation":["National Supercomputing Research Center, Singapore"],"lastName":"Jianjian Song","id":"37334976300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7130"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-125X"}],"articleNumber":"769806","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":101,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":562},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital filters","Finite impulse response filter","Quantization","Frequency response","Switches","Filtering","Distributed computing","Digital modulation","Digital-analog conversion","Sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital filters","frequency response","filtering theory","statistical analysis","sensitivity analysis","integer programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signed power-of-two term allocation scheme","digital filter design","filters coefficient values","statistical quantization step-size","frequency response sensitivity","integer programming algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=769806","abstract":"It is well known that if each coefficient value of a digital filter is a sum of signed power-of-two (SPT) terms, the filter can be implemented without using multipliers. In the past decade, several methods have been developed for the design of filters whose coefficient values are sums of SPT terms. Most of these methods are for the design of filters where all the coefficient values have the same number of SPT terms. It has also been demonstrated recently that significant advantage can be achieved if the coefficient values are allocated with different number of SPT terms while keeping the total number of SPT terms for the filter fixed. In this paper, we present a new method for allocating the number of SPT terms to each coefficient value. In our method, the number of SPT terms allocated to a coefficient is determined by the statistical quantization step-size of that coefficient and the sensitivity of the frequency response of the filter to that coefficient. After the assignment of the SPT terms, an integer-programming algorithm is used to optimize the coefficient values. Our technique yields excellent results but does not guarantee optimum assignment of SPT terms. Nevertheless, for any particular assignment of SPT terms, the result obtained is optimum with respect to that assignment.","doi":"10.1109/82.769806","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/82/16694/00769806.pdf","startPage":"577","endPage":"584","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.769806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16694","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signed power-of-two term allocation scheme for the design of digital filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","displayDocTitle":"Signed power-of-two term allocation scheme for the design of digital filters","volume":"46","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6264085","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/769806/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signed power-of-two term allocation scheme for the design of digital filters","sourcePdf":"00769806.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036893S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"101","articleId":"769806","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":769807,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Online music distribution offers advantages to both artist and consumer. As an artist, you can directly reach your fans over the Internet without paying the hefty price that music distribution companies take. As a consumer, you can buy precisely the songs that you want to listen to instead of an entire CD. In addition, you can quickly locate the song that you want to hear, by using PlayList software to organize your online music, rather than look for your CD in all the places that you could have left it. Finally, you can listen to that song anywhere that there's a good network connection without having to bring your audio CD with you. With these incentives, the music world is currently embroiled in fighting legal and technical battles to make online music distribution a reality. It all began with the new MP3 format. MP3 stands for: MPEG 1, Audio Layer 3, and is the audio part of the video compression standard defined by the Moving Pictures Experts Group. MP3 can encode data at a wide range of bit rates. In particular, for music, it achieves near-CD quality at 128 Kbps, or about 1 Mbyte per minute, and most MP3s you'll find will be encoded at this rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/769875/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May/Jun 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May/Jun 1999","publicationDate":"May-June 1999","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6284658","volume":"14","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The MP3 revolution","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The MP3 revolution","sourcePdf":"00769875.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073334S","chronDate":"May/Jun 1999","isNumber":"16695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5254","citationCount":"4","articleId":"769875","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":769885,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This approach is based on a biologically inspired model for dynamic trajectory generation of a point robot or a multi-joint robot manipulator. The state space of the neural network is three-dimensional (3D), where two represent the spatial position in the 2D Cartesian workspace and one represents the orientation of the robot. This model is capable of generating a real-time optimal navigation path for 3-DOF robots through the dynamic neural activity landscape without explicitly optimizing any cost functions, without any learning process, and without any local collision checking procedures. Therefore it is computationally efficient. In addition, this model can deal with real-time navigation with sudden environmental changes, navigation of a robot with multiple targets, and navigation of multiple robots. The stability of the neural network is guaranteed by Lyapunov stability analysis. The effectiveness and efficiency are demonstrated through simulation studies.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1999.769911","startPage":"23","endPage":"28 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (Cat.

In the DD motor system, the disturbance torque directly influences the control accuracy. The high servo stiffness is effective and important for reducing the influence of the disturbance torque. However, the high servo control often makes the system vibratory or unstable. Therefore, the servo gain must be lowered for assuring stability, and the influence of the disturbance becomes serious. In this study, the DD motor system using an electro-rheological (ER) fluid damper is developed. By applying the ER damper to the DD motor system, the gain margin of the control system is improved, so it is possible to realize the high servo control. Finally, it is experimentally shown that the proposed system is effective for high-speed and high-precision control.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1999.769964","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1999.769964","startPage":"188","endPage":"192 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (Cat.

The study considers general cases of parallel parking for a rectangular robot within a rectangular space. The system works in three phases. In scanning phase, the parking environment is detected by ultrasonic sensors mounted on the robot and a parking position and manoeuvring path is produced if the space is sufficient. Then in the positioning phase, the robot reverses to the edge of the parking space avoiding potential collisions. Finally, in manoeuvring phase, the robot moves to the parking position in the parking space in a unified pattern, which may requires backward and forward manoeuvres depending on the dimensions of the parking space. Motion characteristics of this kind of robots are modeled, taking into account the nonholonomic constraints acting on the car-like robot. A collision-free path is planned in reference to the surroundings. The strategy has been integrated into an automated parking system, and implemented in a modified B12 mobile robot, showing capable of safe parking in tight situations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1999.769997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16683","startPage":"311","endPage":"316 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (Cat.
